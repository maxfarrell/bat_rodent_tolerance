acomys cahirinus	Rodentia	rift valley fever phlebovirus	22493102	The role of wild mammals in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus.	"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting primarily domestic ruminants and humans. Numerous vector species are known or implicated in the transmission of RVFV. The role of mammals in the maintenance of RVFV, and the existence of a wild mammal reservoir in the epidemiologic cycle of RVFV, remain largely unknown. Our objective is to present a detailed review of studies undertaken on RVFV, often associated with wild mammals, with the aim of focusing future research on potential reservoirs of the virus. Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of wild ruminants, especially African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), is also discussed. Conflicting results have been published concerning rodents but, based on the literature, the likely candidate species include the African genera Arvicanthis and Micaelamys and the widely introduced roof rat (Rattus rattus). Members of the orders Chiroptera and Rodentia should receive greater attention associated with new research programs. For the other orders mentioned above, few data are available. We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs."	1
acomys cahirinus	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1

ammospermophilus nelsoni	Rodentia	western equine encephalitis virus	4426699	Experimental infection with western equine encephalomyelitis virus in wild rodents indigenous to Kern County, California.	"Six species of rodents from Kern County, California, were inoculated subcutaneously with western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus to determine their susceptibility to infection and their potential as natural hosts. Ammospermophilus nelsoni, Citellus beecheyi, Dipodomys heermanni, Dipodomys nitratoides, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Sciurus griseus were readily infected. Infection was usually fatal in Dipodomys species, C. beecheyi, and S. griseus, but was clinically inapparent in other species. Viremic responses varied greatly in magnitude and duration in different species and with different viral strains. Viremic animals that survived developed high titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody. Hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies persisted at high titers for at least 8 to 58 weeks after infection, except in P. maniculatus. If animals died during or shortly after the viremic phase of infection, the virus usually was recoverable from numerous organs. Long-term survival of virus could not be demonstrated in A. nelsoni and Dipodomys species. It is concluded that A. nelsoni and P. maniculatus are not important natural hosts of WEE virus; they are susceptible to infection and develop antibodies, but serological surveys of the same species rarely reveal evidence of infection. S. griseus, D. heermanni, D. nitratoides, and possibly C. beecheyi are aberrant hosts of WEE virus since most of them died when infected. Two species of ticks that are ectoparasitic on rodents in Kern County were evaluated as vectors of WEE virus. Dermacentor parumapertus failed to become infected after feeding on viremic hosts, and Ornithodorus parkeri became infected but failed to transmit virus."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	24670	Lee HW, Lee PW, and Johnson KM (1978). Isolation of the etiologic agent of Korean Hemorrhagic Fever. The Journal of Infectious Diseases 137:298-308.	"Lung tissues from 73 rodents (Apodemus agrarius coreae) gave specific immunofluorescent reactions when they reacted with sera from patients convalescing from Korean hemorrhagic fever. Similar staaining was observed in the lungs of A. agrarius inoculated with acute-phase sera obtained from two patients with this disease. The unidentified agent was successfully propagated in adult A. agrarius through eight passages representing a cumulative dilution of greater than 10(-17). Experimentally inoculated rodents developed specific fluorescent antigen in the lung, kidney, liver, parotid glands, and bladder. Organs, especially lungs, were positive beginning 10 days and continuing through 69 days after inoculation. The agent could not be cultivated in several types of cell cultures nor in laboratory animals. No fluorescence was observed when infected A. agrarius lung tissues were reacted with antisera to Marburg virus, Ebola virus, and serval arenaviruses. Diagnostic increases in immunofluorescent antibodies occurred in 113 of 116 severe and 11 of 34 milder cases of clinically suspected Korean hemorrhagic fever. Antibodies were present during the first week of symptoms, reached a peak at the end of the second week, and persisted for up to 14 years. Convalescent-phase sera from four persons suffering a similar disease in the Soviet Union were also positive for antibodies."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	2861296	Experimental infection with Puumala virus, the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica, in bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus).	"Subclinical chronic infections characterized by transient viremia, prolonged virus shedding in oropharyngeal secretions and feces, and virus persistence in tissues (particularly lung) developed in laboratory-bred weanling bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) inoculated intramuscularly with Puumala virus (strain Hällnäs), the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica. Viral antigen, as evidence by granular fluorescence, was detected in the lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas, salivary glands, and small intestine. Infectious virus was found in the lungs from 14 to 270 days postinoculation, and feces and urine collected 35 to 130 days postinoculation were regularly and sporadically infectious, respectively. Horizontal transmission coincided with virus shedding in oropharyngeal secretions. Suckling voles also developed asymptomatic persistent infections after intracerebral inoculation, and histopathological changes were absent despite widespread infection. Our data resemble findings in Apodemus agrarius experimentally infected with Hantaan virus, the prototype virus of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, suggesting that the mechanisms of maintenance and transmission of Puumala and Hantaan viruses are similar in their respective wild-rodent hosts."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	2869749	Pathogenesis of experimental Hantaan virus infection in laboratory rats.	"Weanling Fischer rats inoculated intramuscularly with Hantaan virus (strain 76-118) developed subclinical infections characterized by transient viremia and shedding of virus in saliva, persistence of virus in lung, pancreas, spleen and liver, and development of fluorescent and neutralizing antibodies in serum with immune complex deposition in lung. Viremia and virus shedding in saliva occurred 10 to 13 days after inoculation. Horizontal intracage transmission of infection occurred between 35 and 63 days post-inoculation, long after disappearance of virus in oropharyngeal secretions and blood. Multiple attempts to demonstrate infectious virus in feces and urine during this period were unsuccessful. The inability to detect virus in urine samples of experimentally infected rats may have resulted from intermittent or low-titered viruria. This contrasts sharply with the prolonged high-titered viruria reported in striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) infected with Hantaan virus, suggesting differences in the mode(s) of virus transmission in nature."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	6116436	Intraspecific transmission of Hantaan virus, etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever, in the rodent Apodemus agrarius.	"Experimental parameters of infection and intraspecific transmission of Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever, in Apodemus agrarius rodents were determined. Mice inoculated by the intramuscular route experienced viremia for about 1 week beginning on day 7. After 3 weeks, immunofluorescent and neutralizing antibodies were present and no mouse ever developed signs of acute illness. Virus was recovered from lung, kidney, salivary gland, and liver, and virus excretion in urine, saliva, and feces occurred from about day 10 through day 360 (urine) post-inoculation. Antigen, but not infectious virus, was persistent in lung tissue for as long as 1 year. Horizontal contact infection occurred among cage-mates regardless of sexual pairing up to 360 days after infection and no evidence for participation of ectoparasitic arthropods in such transmission was obtained."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	6127366	Isolation of Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever, from wild urban rats.	"Urban rats captured in Seoul and four nearby Korean cities were found to have immunofluorescent antibodies reactive with Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF). Serum antibodies were detected in 13% from 477 Rattus norvegicus and 11% of 47 Rattus rattus. Hantaan viral antigen was found in pulmonary tissues of 42 animals, and Hantaan virus was recovered from 23 rats, all but two of which were R. norvegicus. Wistar rats were qualitatively much more sensitive than Apodemus agrarius rodents for isolation of virus from tissues of wild rats. Wistar rats inoculated with one of these strains had virus in lung and spleen for at least 75 days. These results document the existence of an urban cycle for Hantaan virus, which had been suspected on the basis of the occurrence of sporadic urban cases in humans of KHF, and suggest that Rattus-borne Hantaan virus may be widely distributed in urban centers."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	12163608	Hantaan virus infection causes an acute neurological disease that is fatal in adult laboratory mice.	"Hantaan virus, the etiological agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever, is transmitted to humans from persistently infected mice (Apodemus agrarius), which serve as the primary reservoir. Here we demonstrate that several strains of adult Mus musculus domesticus (C57BL/6, BALB/c, AKR/J, and SJL/J) were susceptible to Hantaan virus infection when infected intraperitoneally. First clinical signs were loss of weight, ruffled fur, and reduced activity, which were followed by neurological symptoms, such as paralyses and convulsions. Within 2 days of disease onset, the animals died of acute encephalitis. PCR analysis indicated a systemic infection with viral RNA present in all major organs. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses of postmortem material detected viral antigen and RNA in the central nervous system (predominantly brain), liver, and spleen. In the central nervous system, viral antigen and RNA colocalized with perivascular infiltrations, the predominant pathological finding. To investigate the involvement of the interferon system in Hantaan virus pathogenesis, we infected alpha/beta interferon receptor knockout mice. These animals were more susceptible to Hantaan virus infection, indicating an important role of interferon-induced antiviral defense mechanisms in Hantaan virus pathogenesis. The present model may help to overcome shortcomings in the development of therapeutic and prophylactic measurements against hantavirus infections."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus c	19297486	A novel cardiotropic murine adenovirus representing a distinct species of mastadenoviruses.	"During cell culture isolation experiments to recover Dobrava hantavirus from a suspension of liver from a striped field mouse (Apodemus agrarius), an unknown virus was coisolated. Atypically for hantaviruses, it had extensive cytopathic effects. Using a random PCR approach, it was identified as a novel murine adenovirus, MAdV-3 (for MAdV type 3). A plaque-purified virus clone was prepared and further characterized. The complete genome sequence of MAdV-3 was determined to be 30,570 bp in length. Sequence comparisons to other adenovirus species revealed highest similarity to MAdV-1, the representative of the murine adenovirus A species. However, substantial differences were found in the E1, E3, and E4 genomic regions. The phylogenetic distance of MAdV-3 amino acid sequences for pVIII, protease, polymerase, and hexon from MAdV-1 is markedly higher than 0.1 exchange per position, and, based on our cross-neutralization experiments, MAdV-3 and MAdV-1 can be regarded as different serotypes. Therefore, we propose to classify MAdV-3 as the first isolate of a novel adenovirus species, designated murine adenovirus C (MAdV-C). The novel MAdV-3 virus is not only genetically and serologically distinct from MAdV-1 but also shows a unique organ tropism in infected mice. In contrast to MAdV-1, the virus was not detectable in brain but predominantly infected heart tissue. Thus, infection of mice with cardiotropic MAdV-3 might be an interesting animal model of adenovirus-induced myocarditis."	0
apodemus agrarius	Rodentia	tick-borne encephalitis virus	18240970	Isolation of tick-borne encephalitis viruses from wild rodents, South Korea.	"To determine whether the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is present in vector ticks and mammalian hosts in Korea, we examined two tick species, Haemaphysalis longicornis (n = 548) and Ixodes nipponensis (n = 87), and the lungs or spleens of rodents Apodemus agrarius (n = 24) and wild boars (n = 16). Tick-borne encephalitis virus was detected in samples by reverse transcriptase (RT)-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), after which TBEV-positive samples were inoculated into BHK-21 cells and suckling mice. Tick-borne encephalitis virus genes were detected in 4 of 38 tick pools and 5 of 24 wild rodents. Suckling mice inoculated intracerebrally with TBEV-positive rodent samples showed signs of encephalitis at six days post-inoculation. The isolation of TBEV was confirmed by inoculating samples obtained from the brains of sick mice in cell culture. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the E genes of the TBEV isolates were clustered with the Western subtype (98% identity). This study suggests the possible occurrence of tick-borne encephalitis in Korea."	0
apodemus sylvaticus	Rodentia	equine torovirus	6506447	Antibodies to Berne virus in horses and other animals.	"After inoculation into 2 foals, Berne virus induced neutralizing antibody, but did not cause clinical symptoms. In a horizontal study of seropositive mares and their offspring, a decline of maternal antibodies and a sudden synchronous seroconversion in all foals were observed, again without clinical symptoms. The virus is widespread in the Swiss horse population and has been so during the last decade; rises in antibody titers were noted in 9% of paired sera sampled at random. Positive reactions were also obtained in serum neutralization tests and ELISA using small numbers of horse sera from Germany, France and the U.S.A. The results of neutralization tests and ELISA were correlated in 83% of random samples tested; 13% were neutralization-positive and ELISA-negative and in 4% the inverse was observed. Neutralizing activity was found in the sera of other ungulates (cattle, goat, sheep and pig), laboratory rabbits and 2 species of wild mice (Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus sylvaticus). Inconclusive results were obtained with feline and human sera; those from dogs and foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were consistently negative. The probable occurrence of antigenic variants in Berne-type viruses is discussed."	0
apodemus sylvaticus	Rodentia	murid herpesvirus 7	19940063	Characterization of a novel wood mouse virus related to murid herpesvirus 4.	"Two novel gammaherpesviruses were isolated, one from a field vole (Microtus agrestis) and the other from wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus). The genome of the latter, designated wood mouse herpesvirus (WMHV), was completely sequenced. WMHV had the same genome structure and predicted gene content as murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV4; murine gammaherpesvirus 68). Overall nucleotide sequence identity between WMHV and MuHV4 was 85 % and most of the 10 kb region at the left end of the unique region was particularly highly conserved, especially the viral tRNA-like sequences and the coding regions of genes M1 and M4. The partial sequence (71 913 bp) of another gammaherpesvirus, Brest herpesvirus (BRHV), which was isolated ostensibly from a white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula), was also determined. The BRHV sequence was 99.2 % identical to the corresponding portion of the WMHV genome. Thus, WMHV and BRHV appeared to be strains of a new virus species. Biological characterization of WMHV indicated that it grew with similar kinetics to MuHV4 in cell culture. The pathogenesis of WMHV in wood mice was also extremely similar to that of MuHV4, except for the absence of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue at day 14 post-infection and a higher load of latently infected cells at 21 days post-infection."	0
apodemus sylvaticus	Rodentia	puumala orthohantavirus	12376967	Rodent host specificity of European hantaviruses: evidence of Puumala virus interspecific spillover.	"In order to investigate rodent host specificity of European hantaviruses, experimental infection of colonized and wild-trapped rodents was performed. In addition to the natural rodent reservoir, Clethrionomys glareolus, Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) could infect colonized Microtus agrestis and Lemmus sibiricus, but not Syrian hamsters or Balb/C mice. Neither C. glareolus, nor M. agrestis, could be readily infected by Tula hantavirus (TULV). Wild-trapped Apodemus flavicollis and A. agrarius, the natural reservoirs of Dobrava (DOBV) and Saaremaa (SAAV) hantaviruses, respectively, could both be infected by SAAV. NMRI mice could also be infected by SAAV, but with lower efficiency as compared to Apodemus mice. Balb/C and NMRI laboratory mice, but not C. glareolus, could be infected by DOBV. To our knowledge, this is the first time DOBV and SAAV have been shown to infect adult laboratory mice. Moreover, potential hantavirus spillover infections were investigated in wild-trapped rodents. In addition to the natural host C. glareolus, we also found M. arvalis and A. sylvaticus with a history of PUUV infection. We did not find any C. glareolus or A. sylvaticus infected with TULV, a hantavirus which is known to circulate in the same geographical regions of Belgium."	0

arvicanthis niloticus	Rodentia	rift valley fever phlebovirus	10817634	The potential role of rodents in the enzootic cycle of Rift Valley fever virus in Senegal.	"Wild rodents (214) of fourteen species were trapped at seven sites in Senegal. Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys erythroleucus were among the most frequently collected species (77.2% of total capture). All rodents were examined for the presence of anti-Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibody; the prevalence over all sampled species was 3.8%, varying widely with respect to species and location. Four of 14 species of rodents were found to have anti-RVFV antibodies: Rattus rattus (one positive of two tested) Mastomys huberti (13.5%), A. niloticus (4.3%), and M. erthroleucus (2.4%). The highest prevalence of anti-RVFV antibody was recorded within the enzootic area of the Senegal River delta, at Richard Toll (9.6%).

arvicola amphibius	Rodentia	tula orthohantavirus	22225425	Tula virus infections in the Eurasian water vole in Central Europe.	"Recent reports of novel hantaviruses in shrews and moles and the detection of rodent-borne hantaviruses in different rodent species raise important questions about their host range and specificity, evolution, and host adaptation. Tula virus (TULV), a European hantavirus, is believed to be slightly or non-pathogenic in humans and was initially detected in the common vole Microtus arvalis, the East European vole M. levis (formerly rossiaemeridionalis), and subsequently in other Microtus species. Here we report the first multiple RT-PCR detection and sequence analyses of TULV in the Eurasian water vole Arvicola amphibius from different regions in Germany and Switzerland. Additional novel TULV S-, M-, and L-segment sequences were obtained from M. arvalis and M. agrestis trapped in Germany at sites close to trapping sites of TULV-RT-PCR-positive water voles. Serological investigations using a recombinant TULV nucleocapsid protein revealed the presence of TULV-reactive antibodies in RT-PCR-positive and a few RT-PCR-negative water voles.

Tula Virus Infections in the Eurasian Water Vole in Central Europe. Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases 12:503-513.	"Recent reports of novel hantaviruses in shrews and moles and the detection of rodent-borne hantaviruses in different rodent species raise important questions about their host range and specificity, evolution, and host adaptation. Tula virus (TULV), a European hantavirus, is believed to be slightly or non-pathogenic in humans and was initially detected in the common vole Microtus arvalis, the East European vole M. levis (formerly rossiaemeridionalis), and subsequently in other Microtus species. Here we report the first multiple RT-PCR detection and sequence analyses of TULV in the Eurasian water vole Arvicola amphibius from different regions in Germany and Switzerland. Additional novel TULV S-, M-, and L-segment sequences were obtained from M. arvalis and M. agrestis trapped in Germany at sites close to trapping sites of TULV-RT-PCR-positive water voles. Serological investigations using a recombinant TULV nucleocapsid protein revealed the presence of TULV-reactive antibodies in RT-PCR-positive and a few RT-PCR-negative water voles. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a geographical clustering of the novel S-, M-, and L-segment sequences from A. amphibius with those of M. arvalis- and M. agrestis-derived TULV lineages, and may suggest multiple TULV spillover or a potential host switch to A. amphibius. Future longitudinal studies of sympatric Microtus and Arvicola populations and experimental infection studies have to prove the potential of A. amphibius as an additional TULV reservoir host."	0
atherurus africanus	Rodentia	monkeypox virus	23626656	A review of experimental and natural infections of animals with monkeypox virus between 1958 and 2012.	"Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was discovered in 1958 during an outbreak in an animal facility in Copenhagen, Denmark. Since its discovery, MPXV has revealed a propensity to infect and induce disease in a large number of animals within the mammalia class from pan-geographical locations. This finding has impeded the elucidation of the natural host, although the strongest candidates are African squirrels and/or other rodents. Experimentally, MPXV can infect animals via a variety of multiple different inoculation routes; however, the natural route of transmission is unknown and is likely to be somewhat species specific. In this review we have attempted to compile and discuss all published articles that describe experimental or natural infections with MPXV, dating from the initial discovery of the virus through to the year 2012. We further discuss the comparative disease courses and pathologies of the host species."	1

calomys callosus	Rodentia	lebombo virus	2033390	Brown SE, Morrison HG, Karabatsos N, and Knudson DL (1991). Genetic relatedness of two new Orbivirus serogroups: Orungo and Lebombo. The Journal of general virology 72 ( Pt 5):1065-1072.	"Orungo and Lebombo orbivirus isolates were examined for their intra- and intergroup genetic relatedness by blot hybridization and gene reassortment; blot hybridization was also used to examine the relatedness of selected Orungo and Lebombo isolates to known orbiviruses. Among the Orungo isolates, greater than 74% sequence similarity was shown in the majority of their genes. Gene 2 was the most divergent gene, with four unique types identified, and genes 5, 6 and 10 were variant among the isolates. Plaque reduction neutralization tests revealed at least four serotypes, a result which correlated with the hybridization data. Gene reassortment was shown between two representative Orungo isolates. Among the Lebombo isolates, two hybridization types were identified between which gene reassortment was demonstrated. Unique genes were not shown, whereas genes 2, 5 and 10 exhibited minor sequence variability. Geographic distribution correlated with relatedness among the Lebombo isolates, which was not the case among the Orungo isolates. Orungo and Lebombo viruses did not cross-hybridize or reassort their genes in vitro, in intergroup studies. In blot hybridization tests of Orungo and Lebombo isolates with known orbivirus serogroups and ungrouped orbiviruses, no strong cross-hybridization was seen. These results demonstrate that Orungo and Lebombo are distinct from each other and from other orbiviruses, and should therefore be recognized as two new Orbivirus serogroups."	0
carollia perspicillata	Chiroptera	rabies lyssavirus	21468481	Rabies diagnosis and serology in bats from the State of São Paulo, Brazil.	"Bats are one of the most important reservoirs and vectors of the rabies virus in the world., From 1988 to 2003, the Zoonosis Control Center in São Paulo City performed rabies diagnosis on 5,670 bats by direct immunofluorescent test and mouse inoculation test. Blood samples were collected from 1,618 bats and the sera were analyzed using the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test to confirm rabies antibodies., Forty-four (0.8%) bats were positive for rabies. The prevalence of rabies antibodies was 5.9% using 0.5IU/ml as a cutoff. Insectivorous bats (69.8%) and bats of the species Molossus molossus (51.8%) constituted the majority of the sample; however, the highest prevalence of antibodies were observed in Glossophaga soricina (14/133), Histiotus velatus (16/60), Desmodus rotundus (8/66), Artibeus lituratus (5/54), Nyctinomops macrotis (3/23), Tadarida brasiliensis (3/48), Carollia perspicillata (3/9), Eumops auripendulus (2/30), Nyctinomops laticaudatus (2/16), Sturnira lilium (2/17) and Eumops perotis (1/13). The prevalence of rabies antibodies was analyzed by species, food preference and sex., The expressive levels of antibodies associated with the low virus positivity verified in these bats indicate that rabies virus circulates actively among them."	0

Journal of Infectious Diseases 141:787-793.	"The effects of maternal infections with guinea pig cytomegalovirus (CMV) at different stages of gestation were evaluated in mothers, fetuses, and newborn animals. Increased cervical excretion of guinea pig CMV was detected in pregnant animals one to 30 days after inoculation. Fetal infection occurred in utero regardless of the time of maternal infection. The frequencies of stillbirths and viral infection in newborn offspring were higher in mothers infected in late gestation than in mothers infected during the first trimester of pregnancy. The major factor affecting isolation of guinea pig CMV from offspring was the duration of maternal infection. Virus was detected most often in fetuses and newborn animals within two weeks after inoculation of the mothers. Thereafter, guinea pig CMV disappeared progressively in the progeny, although histological lesions were observed and virus was found in the salivary glands of some offspring for as long as 14 weeks after delivery."	0

"Guinea pigs were inoculated intra-tracheally with bovine parainfluenza type 3 virus (PI-3) to investigate airway responsiveness to histamine and arecoline in vitro. Two days after saline or PI-3 inoculation no difference in the reactivity of the tracheal spirals was observed after cumulative concentration/response curves with both drugs. Similarly, contractions of parenchymal strips, induced by histamine, did not differ between both groups. However, 4 days after PI-3 inoculation the histamine induced contraction of the tracheal spirals was increased by 47% and the arecoline induced contractions by 32% as compared to the control group. Further, the contractions induced by histamine in parenchymal strips were significantly enhanced (p less than 0.01) in the PI-3 treated group. In conclusion, PI-3 infection of guinea pig respiratory tract induces hyperreactivity of the central and peripheral airways in vitro."	0
cavia porcellus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 3	2992331	In vivo and in vitro studies on the use of the guinea pig as a model for virus-provoked airway hyperreactivity.	"The parainfluenza 3 (P-3)-infected guinea pig was examined as a model for virus-provoked airway hyperreactivity by measuring changes in airway overflow pressure in response to intravenously (iv) administered histamine. In vitro responses of lung parenchymal strips to several contractile substances were also measured. All studies were conducted 4 days after nasal insufflation with P-3 or P-3 growth medium (control). Increases in airway overflow pressure caused by histamine were enhanced by P-3 infection, and the dose required to produce a standard level of response was decreased (i.e., there was an increase in sensitivity to histamine). Enhancement of in vivo histamine responses caused by P-3 was prevented both by cutting the vagus nerves in the midcervical region and by iv administered hexamethonium, 5 mg/kg. The enhancement was not blocked by 1 mg/kg of atropine given iv, but was blocked by a larger dose 5 mg/kg. The larger dose of atropine significantly antagonized responses to histamine in the P-3-infected state. Increases in airway overflow pressure produced by electrical stimulation of the left vagus and nicotine (1 and 10 mg/kg given iv), both studied after bilateral vagotomy and propranolol, 1 mg/kg given iv, were also enhanced by P-3 infection. Atropine, 1 mg/kg given iv blocked the P-3-induced enhancement of responses to vagus stimulation. Propranolol, 1 mg/kg, and phentolamine, 3 mg/kg, given together iv, produced a doubling of the airway overflow pressure only in P-3-infected animals. Propranolol alone or other receptor antagonists did not produce as marked a change in either group of animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	0
cavia porcellus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 3	6262372	Sensitive plaque neutralization assay for parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus.	"A sensitive plaque neutralization assay for parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus was developed in Vero and MA 104 cell cultures. The tests were performed in semimicrotoiter trays containing 24 wells, 16 mm in diameter. Parainfluenza virus type 1 formed plaques in Vero and MA 104 cells only when trypsin was added to the overlay medium. Plaquing of parainfluenza virus type 1 was more sensitive and technically reproducible in MA 104 cells than in Vero cells. Parainfluenza virus types 2 and 3 and respiratory syncytial virus readily formed plaques in Vero cells. Plaques with all viruses were necrotic in character, except for plaques produced by parainfluenza virus type 3, which appeared red due to an increased uptake of neutral red by infected cells. Different conditions for plaquing of the four viruses had to be used to obtain plaques of suitable size. Antibody titers of commercially prepared guinea pig typing sera were 5- to 50-fold higher by the plaque neutralization test than by complement fixation. The addition of guinea pig immunoglobulin G antiglobulin to the serum-virus mixtures enhanced the conventional neutralization test 5- to 10-fold. The sensitivity and specificity of the plaque neutralization test was also determined with sera of marmosets experimentally infected with parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3. The generally low postinfection titers could be enhanced, on the average, 40-fold by using human immunoglobulin G antiglobulin in the neutralization test. A low degree of cross-reactivity was shown between parainfluenza virus types 1 and 3 both in the conventional neutralization test and in the anti-immunoglobulin enhanced neutralization test."	0
cavia porcellus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 3	9154673	Role of sensory neuropeptides in PIV-3-infection-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in guinea pigs.	"Viral respiratory tract infections are known to induce transient airway hyper-responsiveness. The role of the nonadrenergic noncholinergic neuropeptide system on virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness was studied in the guinea pig. Ten guinea pigs were inoculated with parainfluenza 3 virus (PIV-3.2 x 10(6) PFU) by nasal route. 16 animals served as untreated controls. Viral infection was proven by histological changes and by demonstration of viral antigen using immunohistochemical techniques. Four days after inoculation, airway responsiveness to inhaled acetylcholine (ACH) aerosol was measured in anesthetized and tracheotomized guinea pigs. The ACH concentration which produced an increase of 100% in pulmonary resistance (PC100 RI) and in dynamic elastance (PC100 Edyn) was calculated from a 5-step ACH dose-response curve (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0% ACH). Two further groups of 8 PIV-3-infected guinea pigs and 8 noninfected control animals were pretreated with capsaicin in increasing doses (50, 100, 125 and 150 mg/kg) on 4 consecutive days starting 6 days before virus inoculation. Measurements of airway responsiveness to ACH were performed 4 days after virus inoculation. Another 5 uninfected control animals were pretreated only with the solvent for capsaicin and inoculated with virus-free cell supermatant. PIV-3 infection increased airway responsiveness to ACH compared to noninfected controls [PC100 RI 0.81 vs. > 2.0% ACH (median). p < 0.002 PC100 Edyn 0.52 vs. 1.07% ACH (median), p < 0.01]. In capsaicin-pretreated PIV-3-infected animals, airway hyperresponsiveness was completely prevented compared to the virus-infected group without capsaicin pretreatment (PC100 RI > 2.0 vs. 0.81% ACH, p < 0.01; PC100 Edyn 1.42 vs. 0.52% ACH p < 0.01). As neuropeptide depletion with capsaicin completely prevented the increase in airway constrictory response to ACH following virus infection, we conclude that neuropeptides are effectively involved in PIV-3-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in the guinea pig."	0
cavia porcellus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 3	12540169	Characterization of a novel parainfluenza virus, caviid parainfluenza virus 3, from laboratory guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus).	"A novel Respirovirus was isolated from nasopharyngeal swab specimens from clinically normal laboratory guinea pigs, and was characterized and named caviid parainfluenza virus 3 (CavPIV-3). The CavPIV-3 is enveloped, is 100 to 300 nm in diameter, and has a characteristic 15-nm-diameter chevron-shaped virus ribonucleocapsid protein. Sequence analysis of the fusion glycoprotein of CavPIV-3 revealed it to be 94% identical to human and guinea pig parainfluenza 3 (PIV-3) viruses and 80% identical to bovine PIV-3. To determine whether CavPIV-3 causes clinical disease in laboratory guinea pigs and to compare the serologic response of guinea pigs to CavPIV-3 and to other paramyxoviruses, an infection study was performed, in which groups of guinea pigs were inoculated with CavPIV-3, Sendai virus, simian virus 5 (SV-5), murine pneumonia virus (PVM), or bovine PIV-3 virus. During the course of the study, guinea pigs were maintained in an infectious disease suite, housed in Micro-Isolator cages, and were only manipulated under a laminar flow hood. Clinical signs of disease were not observed in any of the paramyxovirus-inoculated guinea pigs during the eight-week course of the study, and histologic signs of disease were not evident at necropsy eight weeks after inoculation. Guinea pigs inoculated with CavPIV-3, Sendai virus, PVM, and bovine PIV-3 developed robust homologous or heterologous serologic responses. In contrast, guinea pigs inoculated with SV-5 developed modest or equivocal serologic responses, as assessed by use of an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Further, use of the SV-5 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay resulted in the highest degree of non-specific reactivity among all of the paramyxovirus assays. In summary, CavPIV-3 is a novel guinea pig Respirovirus that subclinically infects laboratory guinea pigs, resulting in a robust serologic response, but no observed clinical or histologic disease. The CavPIV-3 fusion glycoprotein gene sequence is available from GenBank as accession No. AF394241, and the CavPIV-3 virus is available from the American Type Culture Collection as accession No. DR-1547."	0
cavia porcellus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 3	19010509	Chimeric human parainfluenza virus bearing the Ebola virus glycoprotein as the sole surface protein is immunogenic and highly protective against Ebola virus challenge.	"We generated a new live-attenuated vaccine against Ebola virus (EBOV) based on a chimeric virus HPIV3/DeltaF-HN/EboGP that contains the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) as the sole transmembrane envelope protein combined with the internal proteins of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3). Electron microscopy analysis of the virus particles showed that they have an envelope and surface spikes resembling those of EBOV and a particle size and shape resembling those of HPIV3. When HPIV3/DeltaF-HN/EboGP was inoculated via apical surface of an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, the virus was released from the apical surface; when applied to basolateral surface, the virus infected basolateral cells but did not spread through the tissue. Following intranasal (IN) inoculation of guinea pigs, scattered infected cells were detected in the lungs by immunohistochemistry, but infectious HPIV3/DeltaF-HN/EboGP could not be recovered from the lungs, blood, or other tissues. Despite the attenuation, the virus was highly immunogenic, and a single IN dose completely protected the animals against a highly lethal intraperitoneal challenge of guinea pig-adapted EBOV."	0

"To establish a guinea pig model of cough induced by human parainfluenza virus type 3 (PIV3) infection, and to investigate the change of the cough reflex sensitivity (CRS)., Sixty male SPF guinea pigs were divided into 6 groups (n=10, each), namely, a normal control group, an asthma group and 4 groups of PIV3 inoculation which included post-infection day (PID) 6, 12, 28, and 42. Infected animals were inoculated by intranasal instillation of PIV3 suspension. Control animals were inoculated by uninfected cell culture medium. Asthma animals were sensitized and challenged by ovalbumin. The Buxco system was used to assess cough reflex sensitivity (CRS) elicited by capsaicin and airway hyper-reaction (AHR). Airway inflammation was studied by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology and lung histopathology., The CRS of PID 6, 12, 28 and 42 groups was 7.50 (5.25), 7.30 (7.25), 8.40 (9.75) and 8.20 (5.50) Cough counts (CCnt). Compared with 2.50 (3.00) CCnt of the vehicle group, the CRS to capsaicin increased significantly in all the animals with PIV3 inoculation (P value were 0.024, 0.03, 0.011 and 0.008) and peaked in PID 42. There was no significant difference (P=0.18) between 3.90 (1.75) CCnt of the asthma animals and the normal control. Animals of PID 6 showed significantly greater AHR to 2 highest concentrations of methacholine than the normal controls. BAL total cell counts of both the PIV3-inoculated and the asthma animals were significantly higher than those of the normal control, with the number of lymphocytes increased significantly within first 2 weeks after PIV3 inoculation. The lung pathology of PIV3-inoculated animals showed airway inflammation without pneumonia in acute infectious phase., An animal model of cough induced by PIV3 was created. The CRS of infected guinea pigs increased significantly in both acute and subacute phases of cough. Elevation of CRS may be characteristic of cough caused by virus."	0

In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia.

cynomys ludovicianus	Rodentia	monkeypox virus	15557083	Extensive lesions of monkeypox in a prairie dog (Cynomys sp).	"Monkeypox with extensive lesions was diagnosed in a prairie dog that was involved in a recent human outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwestern United States. Gross lesions included oral ulcers, pulmonary consolidation, enlarged cervical and thoracic lymph nodes, and multifocal, small, white umbilicated plaques in the gastrointestinal wall. Microscopic lesions were extensive in the lungs and consisted of fibrinonecrotic bronchopneumonia with vasculitis and poorly defined eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in cells thought to be alveolar epithelial cells, histiocytes, and fibroblasts. Multifocal necrotizing lesions, often accompanied by myxedema, were also present in most of the other examined organs. Aggregates of pox viral particles were observed within lesions by transmission electron microscopy. Monkeypox virus infection was confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and virus culture at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This report highlights the difficulties of rapid diagnosis of exotic or emerging diseases and further substantiates the prairie dog as an animal model of monkeypox."	0

Antigenic and genetic characterization of the first rabies virus isolated from the bat Eumops perotis in Brazil. Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo 50:95-99.	"Although the main transmitters of rabies in Brazil are dogs and vampire bats, the role of other species such as insectivorous and frugivorous bats deserves special attention, as the rabies virus has been isolated from 36 bat species. This study describes the first isolation of the rabies virus from the insectivorous bat Eumops perotis. The infected animal was found in the city of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo. The virus was identified by immunofluorescence antibody test (FAT) in central nervous system (CNS) samples, and the isolation was carried out in N2A cell culture and adult mice. The sample was submitted to antigenic typing using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CDC/Atlanta/USA). The DNA sequence of the nucleoprotein gene located between nucleotides 102 and 1385 was aligned with homologous sequences from GenBank using the CLUSTAL/W method, and the alignment was used to build a neighbor-joining distance-based phylogenetic tree with the K-2-P model. CNS was negative by FAT, and only one mouse died after inoculation with a suspension from the bat's CNS. Antigenic typing gave a result that was not compatible with the patterns defined by the panel. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the virus isolated segregated into the same cluster related to other viruses isolated from insectivorous bats belonging to genus Nyctinomops ssp.

"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance.

dipodomys ordii	Rodentia	fort morgan virus	7435797	Recovery of Tonate virus ('Bijou Bridge' strain), a member of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus complex, from Cliff Swallow nest bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) and nestling birds in North America.	"A second virus with distinct biological, serological, and physiochemical properties was detected as a minority viral subpopulation in specimens of Cliff Swallow nest bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) and nestling bird sera containing Fort Morgan (FM) virus. The second virus, detected by a breakthrough neutralization test employing FM antiserum, was present in 5 of 11 FM virus-positive pools of nest bugs and in 4 of 38 birds from Colorado and South Dakota. The concentration of the second virus was 10-fold to 1,000-fold lower than that of FM virus. The second virus, which was provisionally named \"Bijou Bridge\" (BB) virus was shown by conventional serological tests to be a member of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) complex, and by tests employing antisera to the E2 viral glycoprotein to be identical with Tonate virus, previously isolated from birds and mosquitoes only in French Guiana. Experimental infection of House Sparrows and Cliff Swallows showed that they develop brief BB viremias and antibodies. Oe. vicarius bugs were resistant to oral infection with BB virus. The epidemiological significance of recovery of Tonate virus in North American is discussed."	0

eptesicus fuscus	Chiroptera	west nile virus	16103624	Experimental and natural infection of North American bats with West Nile virus.	"Big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and Mexican free-tailed (Tadarida brasiliensis) bats were inoculated with the New York 99 strain of West Nile virus to assess their potential to serve as amplifying hosts and determine the clinical effect of infection. Groups of three or four bats were bled at daily intervals between 1 and 6 days after inoculation to determine the pattern of viremia. Beginning 2 days after inoculation, virus was isolated each day from one or more E. fuscus bats, in titers ranging from 10 to 180 plaque-forming units per milliliter of serum. Virus was not isolated from any of the sera collected from T. brasiliensis bats. None of the bats from either species showed clinical signs associated with exposure to virus. Sera from an additional 149 bats collected in Louisiana in 2002 during an epizootic of West Nile fever were tested for antibodies to virus, and two were found to be positive. These data suggest that bats from these two widely distributed species are unlikely to serve as amplifying hosts for West Nile virus."	0

"Although the main transmitters of rabies in Brazil are dogs and vampire bats, the role of other species such as insectivorous and frugivorous bats deserves special attention, as the rabies virus has been isolated from 36 bat species. This study describes the first isolation of the rabies virus from the insectivorous bat Eumops perotis. The infected animal was found in the city of Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo. The virus was identified by immunofluorescence antibody test (FAT) in central nervous system (CNS) samples, and the isolation was carried out in N2A cell culture and adult mice. The sample was submitted to antigenic typing using a panel of monoclonal antibodies (CDC/Atlanta/USA). The DNA sequence of the nucleoprotein gene located between nucleotides 102 and 1385 was aligned with homologous sequences from GenBank using the CLUSTAL/W method, and the alignment was used to build a neighbor-joining distance-based phylogenetic tree with the K-2-P model. CNS was negative by FAT, and only one mouse died after inoculation with a suspension from the bat's CNS. Antigenic typing gave a result that was not compatible with the patterns defined by the panel.

gerbilliscus kempi	Rodentia	koutango virus	6293325	Antigenic relationships of flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status.	"In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, feces, etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity titrations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary Pekin duck embryo cells, and antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutralization tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five antigenic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, Tamana bat and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in mosquito cells in vitro."	0
gerbilliscus kempi	Rodentia	koutango virus	24942584	The West Nile virus-like flavivirus Koutango is highly virulent in mice due to delayed viral clearance and the induction of a poor neutralizing antibody response.	"The mosquito-borne West Nile virus (WNV) is responsible for outbreaks of viral encephalitis in humans, horses, and birds, with particularly virulent strains causing recent outbreaks of disease in eastern Europe, the Middle East, North America, and Australia. Previous studies have phylogenetically separated WNV strains into two main genetic lineages (I and II) containing virulent strains associated with neurological disease. Several WNV-like strains clustering outside these lineages have been identified and form an additional five proposed lineages. However, little is known about whether these strains have the potential to induce disease. In a comparative analysis with the highly virulent lineage I American strain (WNVNY99), the low-pathogenicity lineage II strain (B956), a benign Australian strain, Kunjin (WNVKUN), the African WNV-like Koutango virus (WNVKOU), and a WNV-like isolate from Sarawak, Malaysia (WNVSarawak), were assessed for neuroinvasive properties in a murine model and for their replication kinetics in vitro. While WNVNY99 replicated to the highest levels in vitro, in vivo mouse challenge revealed that WNVKOU was more virulent, with a shorter time to onset of neurological disease and higher morbidity. Histological analysis of WNVKOU- and WNVNY99-infected brain and spinal cords demonstrated more prominent meningoencephalitis and the presence of viral antigen in WNVKOU-infected mice. Enhanced virulence of WNVKOU also was associated with poor viral clearance in the periphery (sera and spleen), a skewed innate immune response, and poor neutralizing antibody development. These data demonstrate, for the first time, potent neuroinvasive and neurovirulent properties of a WNV-like virus outside lineages I and II., In this study, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo properties of previously uncharacterized West Nile virus strains and West Nile-like viruses. We identified a West Nile-like virus, Koutango virus (WNVKOU), that was more virulent than a known virulent lineage I virus, WNVNY99. The enhanced virulence of WNVKOU was associated with poor viral clearance and the induction of a poor neutralizing antibody response. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of West Nile virus."	0

Electron microscopic appearance and serologic reactions placed it in the vaccinia subgroup of poxviruses. The isolate differed from ectromelia, rabbitpox, vaccinia, monkeypox, and cowpox viruses in pock morphology on chorioallantoic membrane, ceiling temperature, relative innocuity for mice, and cytopathic effect in tissue culture. Like variola minor virus, it had a ceiling temperature of 38 C, produced small hypertrophic foci in tissue culture, and failed to grow in rabbit skin. Inoculated into a rhesus monkey, it caused fever but no skin eruption and produced seroconversion and protection from subsequent challenge with monkeypox virus. The growing list of animal viruses that differ only slightly from smallpox virus suggests the hypothesis that long-term survival of variola virus may be based on inapparent infection in animals as well as virulent spread among humans."	0

Previous studies have phylogenetically separated WNV strains into two main genetic lineages (I and II) containing virulent strains associated with neurological disease. Several WNV-like strains clustering outside these lineages have been identified and form an additional five proposed lineages. However, little is known about whether these strains have the potential to induce disease. In a comparative analysis with the highly virulent lineage I American strain (WNVNY99), the low-pathogenicity lineage II strain (B956), a benign Australian strain, Kunjin (WNVKUN), the African WNV-like Koutango virus (WNVKOU), and a WNV-like isolate from Sarawak, Malaysia (WNVSarawak), were assessed for neuroinvasive properties in a murine model and for their replication kinetics in vitro. While WNVNY99 replicated to the highest levels in vitro, in vivo mouse challenge revealed that WNVKOU was more virulent, with a shorter time to onset of neurological disease and higher morbidity. Histological analysis of WNVKOU- and WNVNY99-infected brain and spinal cords demonstrated more prominent meningoencephalitis and the presence of viral antigen in WNVKOU-infected mice. Enhanced virulence of WNVKOU also was associated with poor viral clearance in the periphery (sera and spleen), a skewed innate immune response, and poor neutralizing antibody development. These data demonstrate, for the first time, potent neuroinvasive and neurovirulent properties of a WNV-like virus outside lineages I and II., In this study, we characterized the in vitro and in vivo properties of previously uncharacterized West Nile virus strains and West Nile-like viruses. We identified a West Nile-like virus, Koutango virus (WNVKOU), that was more virulent than a known virulent lineage I virus, WNVNY99. The enhanced virulence of WNVKOU was associated with poor viral clearance and the induction of a poor neutralizing antibody response. These findings provide new insights into the pathogenesis of West Nile virus."	0
mastomys erythroleucus	Rodentia	rift valley fever phlebovirus	10817634	The potential role of rodents in the enzootic cycle of Rift Valley fever virus in Senegal.	"Wild rodents (214) of fourteen species were trapped at seven sites in Senegal. Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys erythroleucus were among the most frequently collected species (77.2% of total capture). All rodents were examined for the presence of anti-Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibody; the prevalence over all sampled species was 3.8%, varying widely with respect to species and location. Four of 14 species of rodents were found to have anti-RVFV antibodies: Rattus rattus (one positive of two tested) Mastomys huberti (13.5%), A. niloticus (4.3%), and M. erthroleucus (2.4%). The highest prevalence of anti-RVFV antibody was recorded within the enzootic area of the Senegal River delta, at Richard Toll (9.6%). A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus and a strain of laboratory-bred mice were experimentally inoculated with two strains of RVFV and examined for viremia, illness, seroconversion and mortality. A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus demonstrated a limited resistance to infection, thus potentially allowing for the replication of virus in these animals and making these species possible candidates as hosts in the maintenance cycle of RVFV in nature."	0

Mastomys natalensis papilloma virus (MnPV), the causative agent of epithelial proliferations: characterization of the virus particle. J Gen Virol 41:315-323.	"A virus (MnPV) with the structural characteristics of papilloma viruses was isolated from benign and malignant proliferations of adult animals of the inbred line 'GRA Giessen' of Mastomys natalensis. The particles can be banded in CsCl gradients at densities of 1.34 g/ml (full particles) and 1.29 g/ml (empty particles). The virus DNA has a buoyant density of 1.7104 g/ml and can exist in three different conformations (supercoiled circular, nicked circular and linear), the sedimentation values of which have been determined as 23 to 24S, 16 to 17S and 14 to 15S, respectively. Although the mol. wt. of MnPV DNA is similar to that of HPV 1 DNA, the size of the fragments obtained after cleavage of MnPV DNA with the restriction endonuclease Hae III is quite different from the pattern seen with human papilloma virus. The virion contains 12 different polypeptides; the major structural protein has a mol. wt. of 56 000. MnPV is shown to be the causative agent of the skin proliferations, because tumours can be induced by inoculation of purified virus, whereas no cutaneous alterations are observed when the particles are inoculated in the presence of anti-MnPV serum. MnPV can be re-isolated from the experimentally induced tumours."	0
mastomys natalensis	Rodentia	lassa mammarenavirus	19924222	Prevalence and risk factors of Lassa seropositivity in inhabitants of the forest region of Guinea: a cross-sectional study.	"Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic fever endemic in West Africa. The reservoir host of the virus is a multimammate rat, Mastomys natalensis. Prevalence estimates of Lassa virus antibodies in humans vary greatly between studies, and the main modes of transmission of the virus from rodents to humans remain unclear. We aimed to (i) estimate the prevalence of Lassa virus-specific IgG antibodies (LV IgG) in the human population of a rural area of Guinea, and (ii) identify risk factors for positive LV IgG., A population-based cross-sectional study design was used. In April 2000, all individuals one year of age and older living in three prefectures located in the tropical secondary forest area of Guinea (Gueckedou, Lola and Yomou) were sampled using two-stage cluster sampling. For each individual identified by the sampling procedure and who agreed to participate, a standardized questionnaire was completed to collect data on personal exposure to potential risk factors for Lassa fever (mainly contact with rodents), and a blood sample was tested for LV IgG. A multiple logistic regression model was used to determine risk factors for positive LV IgG. A total of 1424 subjects were interviewed and 977 sera were tested. Prevalence of positive LV Ig was of 12.9% [10.8%-15.0%] and 10.0% [8.1%-11.9%] in rural and urban areas, respectively. Two risk factors of positive LV IgG were identified: to have, in the past twelve months, undergone an injection (odds ratio [OR] = 1.8 [1.1-3.1]), or lived with someone displaying a haemorrhage (OR = 1.7 [1.1-2.9]). No factors related to contacts with rats and/or mice remained statistically significant in the multivariate analysis., Our study underlines the potential importance of person-to-person transmission of Lassa fever, via close contact in the same household or nosocomial exposure."	0
mastomys natalensis	Rodentia	lassa mammarenavirus	21142956	Presence of Mopeia virus, an African arenavirus, related to biotope and individual rodent host characteristics: implications for virus transmission.	"The East African Mopeia virus (MOPV) is an arenavirus closely related to the highly pathogenic West African Lassa virus, even sharing the same reservoir rodent host Mastomys natalensis. Because MOPV is not known to cause human disease, it offers a unique alternative for studying Lassa virus transmission. We investigated how habitat, population density, and host characteristics are related to MOPV occurrence in M. natalensis populations in Morogoro, Tanzania. In 3 contrasting habitats, 511 M. natalensis individuals were trapped, 12.1% (58/480 tested individuals) of which tested seropositive for antibodies and 8.4% (41/489 tested individuals) for MOPV-RNA. Although population densities differ among habitats, density and habitat were not significantly correlated to MOPV-RNA or antibody presence. Antibody presence was not significantly correlated with any host characteristics. In contrast, MOPV-RNA presence was inversely related to weight, age, sexual maturity, and body mass index. The model with body mass index as predictor was the best at predicting infection probability. Thirty-five individuals were exclusively MOPV-RNA positive, 52 were exclusively antibody positive, and 6 were both MOPV-RNA and antibody positive. Interpreting these data using experimental infection results from studies on other arenaviruses, this would mean that these infections were very recent, old, and roughly 1-3 weeks after infection, respectively. The higher RNA prevalence in juveniles implies vertical transmission, or that horizontal transmission occurs mainly in this age group due to lack of immunity, higher susceptibility, and/or higher juvenile contact rates. This study demonstrates the strength of combining information on antibody and RNA presence with host characteristics, and how this information can provide valuable insights into transmission dynamics."	0

mastomys natalensis	Rodentia	rift valley fever phlebovirus	22493102	The role of wild mammals in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus.	"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting primarily domestic ruminants and humans. Numerous vector species are known or implicated in the transmission of RVFV. The role of mammals in the maintenance of RVFV, and the existence of a wild mammal reservoir in the epidemiologic cycle of RVFV, remain largely unknown. Our objective is to present a detailed review of studies undertaken on RVFV, often associated with wild mammals, with the aim of focusing future research on potential reservoirs of the virus. Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of wild ruminants, especially African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), is also discussed. Conflicting results have been published concerning rodents but, based on the literature, the likely candidate species include the African genera Arvicanthis and Micaelamys and the widely introduced roof rat (Rattus rattus). Members of the orders Chiroptera and Rodentia should receive greater attention associated with new research programs. For the other orders mentioned above, few data are available. We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs."	1

meriones hurrianae	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1

"The pathogenesis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection in fetal, newborn, and young adult hamsters was studied. Infected newborn hamsters initially developed a persistent viremia and viruria with titers often in excess of 10(4.0) mean infectious doses/0.03 ml of blood or urine. After week 12 two different patterns of infection became evident. Approximately one-half of the hamsters eventually cleared the infection, whereas the others developed a chronic progressive and ultimalely fatal disease characterized by continuous high-titered viremia and viruria and high titers of virus in their tissues. Complement-fixing antibody and, to a lesser degree, virus-neutralizing antibody coexisted with the viremia. Hamsters with persistently high levels of viremia and viruria developed chronic glomerulonephritis and widespread vasculitis, whereas hamsters that cleared their infections did not develop these lesions. Litters of hamsters born to viremic mothers were invariably infected. Litter sizes were small and breeding effectiveness was reduce; however, vertical, congenital infection was successfully passed through three generations. The course of infection in the congenitally infected hamsters was similar to that in newborn infected hamsters, with all animals producing complement-fixing antibody, some animals being capable of clearing the viremia and remaining healthy, and other animals having persistent viremia and fatal disease. Inoculated young adult hamsters did not become diseased, developed viremia and viruria which persisted up to 3 and 6 months, respectively, and developed complement-fixing antibody by 10 days after infection. The prolonged urinary excretion of large amounts of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus by asymptomatic, chronically infected hamsters is an important public health consideration when dealing with potential human infection."	0

"In adult Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), intraperitoneal or footpad inoculation of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strains, WE or Armstrong (ARM), caused systemic infection and induced serum LCMV-antibody. Hamster and virus strain-dependent lethal disease also occurred. With WE, MHA and PD4 inbred hamsters failed to eliminate infection and died of wasting disease. LSH and CB inbred hamsters resisted lethal WE-disease and cleared infection. LVG hamsters and inbred LHC hamsters were intermediate in WE-susceptibility; some died of wasting, while others survived with little illness. Resistance to lethal WE-disease directly correlated with a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to live-virus footpad inoculation. In WE-resistant LSH and CB hamsters, DTH-responses were induced by intraplantar WE-inoculation; footpad edema began by 5 days, reached maximum thickness by 7 to 9 days, and subsided thereafter. In the other hamster strains, DTH to WE could not be elicited. Unlike WE, ARM was hamster-avirulent; infections were self-limited and did not induce DTH. All survivors of primary LCMV (WE or ARM)-infection resisted secondary WE-challenge, and did not develop DTH to LCMV. Immunosuppressive treatments, abrogating DTH and antibody responses to LCMV, rendered all hamsters susceptible to lethal WE-infection. Hamster DTH most likely mediated resistance to virulent LCMV-infection."	0

"In different strains of inbred Syrian golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strains WE and Armstrong (ARM) produced systemic infection with infective virus and viral antigens detected predominantly in reticuloendothelial organs. Host and virus strain-dependent fatal wasting disease also occurred. After infection with WE, all MHA and PD4 hamsters died of a progressive wasting disease and infectivity persisted in organs at relatively high titres. LSH and CB strain hamsters resisted lethal disease and totally eliminated infection. LVG and LHC strain hamsters were intermediate in susceptibility to WE; some died of wasting and had persistently infected organs, while others cleared infection and survived. ARM was avirulent causing an inapparent infection in all hamsters. LCMV antibody responses were temporally comparable for all hamsters with either lethal or non-lethal infection. Histologically, lymphoid hyperplasia and low-grade systemic perivascular mononuclear leukocyte infiltration were found in all LCMV-infected hamsters. However, non-necrotic segmental ileal changes, which included vascular congestion, minimal haemorrhage and crypt epithelial growth extension into the intestinal wall, were found in susceptible hamsters when infected with the lethal WE strain."	0

"An acutely lethal LCMV disease model has been established in the Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) in which lethality and disease are dependent upon both the inbred hamster strain and the LCMV strain. Young adult inbred, male and female, hamsters were tested for lethal-disease susceptibility by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strains, WE or Armstrong (ARM). With WE inocula, PD4 and MHA inbred hamsters were highly susceptible to a wasting disease. LVG and LHC inbred hamsters were intermediate in susceptibility; some of these animals died of wasting illness, and others exhibited minimal disease and survived. CB and LSH hamsters were highly resistant to any disease by WE. Mean survival times of susceptible hamsters given lethal WE inocula approximated 2.5 weeks and were not dependent on virus dose. By 1.5 weeks after WE inoculation wasting disease signs were notable and consisted of lethargy, progressive body weight loss, and diarrhea. The LCMV strain, ARM, was avirulent for all hamster strains, causing neither death nor disease. Hamsters surviving WE or ARM inoculation appeared healthy, produced LCMV antibody, and acquired resistance to further lethal WE challenge. Despite hamster-lethality differences. WE and ARM appeared comparably immunogenic for all hamster strains, based on host antibody titers. A number of other differences between the LCMV strains were, however, noted which could be relevant to virus virulence and lethality for hamster hosts. These included guinea pig lethality, temperature sensitivity, and plaque morphology."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	mesocricetus auratus polyomavirus 1	11210944	The hamster polyomavirus--a brief review of recent knowledge.	"The hamster polyomavirus (HaPV) was first described in 1967 as a virus associated with skin epithelioma of the Syrian hamster. The tumors appear spontaneously in a hamster colony bred in Berlin-Buch (HaB). Virus particles isolated from skin epitheliomas cause lymphoma and leukemia when injected into newborn hamsters from a distinct colony bred in Potsdam, Germany (HaP). The viral genome has been totally sequenced and the overall genetic organization establishes HaPV as a member of the polyomaviruses. HaPV is a second example of an middle T (MT) antigen encoding polyomavirus and nucleotide sequence homologies designates the mouse polyomavirus (Py) as the closest relative. Lymphomas induced by HaPV in HaP hamsters do not contain virus particles but instead accumulate different amounts of nonrandomly deleted free and/or integrated viral genomes. Transgenic mice produced by microinjection of HaPV DNA into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of Gat: NMRI mice developed both, epitheliomas and lymphomas. Both tumor types contain extrachromosomal DNA. HaPV DNA was found to replicate in hamster lymphoid and fibroblast cell lines. Fully reproductive cycles could be detected only in GD36 lymphoblastic leukemia cells. HaPV carries the full transforming properties of a polyomavirus in vitro. Immortalization of primary rat cells is essentially carried out by the HaPV large T (LT) antigen and coexpression of HaPV MT and HaPV small T (ST) antigen is required for full transformation of rat fibroblasts. The preferential binding of HaPV MT to c-Fyn, a Src family kinase, has been proposed as a mechanism leading to lymphoid malignancies. Heterologous expression of HaPV-VP1 allowed the formation of virus like particles (VLPs) resembling HaPV particles. The high flexibility of HaPV-VP1 for insertion of foreign peptides offers a broad range of potential applications, especially in vaccine development."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	west nile virus	8930665	Flavivirus-induced up-regulation of MHC class I antigens; implications for the induction of CD8+ T-cell-mediated autoimmunity.	"Infection of a wide variety of cells of human, mouse and other species' origin by flaviviruses such as WNV, YF, Den, MVE, KUN and JE, increases the cell-surface expression of MHC class I. This MHC class I up-regulation is not due to increased MHC class I synthesis per se, but the result of increased peptide availability in the ER for MHC class I assembly. This is most likely due to the interaction of the viral polyprotein with the ER membrane during viral replication. Flavivirus infection can overcome peptide deficiency in TAP-deficient or non-permissive cell lines such as RMA-S and Syrian hamster cells, BHK and NIL-2. The consequence of this increased MHC class I expression manifests itself in reduced susceptibility to NK cells and augmented lysis by Tc cells. In mice, long-term flavivirus-immune Tc cell memory formation is impaired, following the appearance of strong anti-self Tc cell reactivity observed in in vitro cultures from splenocytes of flavivirus-primed animals. We hypothesize that flavivirus-induced MHC class I up-regulation leads to transient T-cell autoimmunity, followed by down-regulation of both autoimmunity and virus-specific Tc cell memory. Furthermore, we speculate that flavivirus infections of humans in the tropics may be responsible for the observed lower incidence of overt autoimmunity in these geographic regions than in temperate climates where flaviviruses are not endemic."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	west nile virus	15185728	Effect of interferon-alpha and interferon-inducers on West Nile virus in mouse and hamster animal models.	"The recent West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in the United States has increased the need to identify effective therapies. Studies were conducted in cell culture and in rodent animal models to determine the efficacy of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon (IFN) inducers and ribavirin, alone or in combination with IFN, in treating WNV. Intraperitoneal injection of IFN-alpha B/D (qd for 7 days), polyI-polyC(12)U [Ampligen (every other day for 7 days)] and topically applied imiquimod (qd for 7 days), administered from 1 day before viral challenge, were effective in protecting, respectively, 100%, 100% and 70% of BALB/c mice from mortality induced by subcutaneous injection of WNV. When IFN-alpha B/D or Ampligen treatments were delayed to 4-6 h before viral challenge in mice, efficacy was greatly diminished. Infected Syrian golden hamsters treated with interferon alphacon-1 (Infergen) and Ampligen 4-6 h before viral challenge gained more weight and had a greater survival than saline-treated animals. A combination study of subcutaneously administered Infergen (5 to 0.05 microg/kg/day) and ribavirin (75 to 7.5 mg/kg/day) in >7 week old hamsters demonstrated that Infergen was slightly efficacious in reducing mortality and disease signs; however, it was not synergistic in its antiviral effects when combined with ribavirin. Ribavirin treatment alone increased mortality of infected hamsters. The reduced mortality correlated with reduced plasma viraemia. Since WNV-infected patients have already been treated with IFN and ribavirin and future clinical trials have been suggested, this first report of IFN alone or in combination with ribavirin in WNV-infected animal models might provide useful information for subsequent treatment of patients."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	west nile virus	15962223	Persistent West Nile virus infection in the golden hamster: studies on its mechanism and possible implications for other flavivirus infections.	"Golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) experimentally infected with West Nile virus (WNV) developed chronic renal infection and persistent shedding of virus in urine for up to 8 months, despite initial rapid clearance of virus from blood and the timely appearance of high levels of specific neutralizing antibodies. Infectious WNV could be recovered by direct culture of their urine and by cocultivation of kidney tissue for up to 247 days after initial infection. Only moderate histopathologic changes were observed in the kidneys or brain of the chronically infected hamsters, although WNV antigen was readily detected by immunohistochemistry within epithelium, interstitial cells, and macrophages in the distal renal tubules. Comparison of WNV isolates from serial urine samples from individual hamsters over several months indicated that the virus underwent both genetic and phenotypic changes during persistent infection. These findings are similar to previous reports of persistent infection with tickborne encephalitis and Modoc viruses."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	yellow fever virus	11319679	Experimental yellow fever virus infection in the Golden Hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). I. Virologic, biochemical, and immunologic studies.	"This report describes the clinical laboratory findings in golden hamsters experimentally infected with yellow fever (YF) virus. An accompanying paper describes the pathologic findings. Following intraperitoneal inoculation of a virulent strain of YF virus, hamsters developed a high-titered viremia (up to 109/mL) lasting 5--6 days and abnormal liver function tests. YF hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies appeared 4 or 5 days after infection, often while viremia was still present. The mortality rate in YF-infected hamsters was variable, depending on the virus strain and the age of the animals. Clinical and pathologic changes in the infected hamsters were very similar to those described in experimentally infected macaques and in fatal human cases of YF, which indicates that the golden hamster may be an excellent alternative animal model, in place of nonhuman primates, for research on the pathogenesis and treatment of YF and other viscerotropic flavivirus diseases."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	yellow fever virus	11319680	Experimental yellow fever virus infection in the Golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). II. Pathology.	"Subadult and adult hamsters were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10(6) TCID(50) of yellow fever (YF) virus (Jimenez strain). Four animals from each group were subjected daily to histologic examination for 9 days. The liver showed spotty necrosis on day 3 after infection, which was followed by steatosis and focally confluent necrosis. In surviving hamsters, hepatocyte regeneration began on day 8, which was accompanied by decreasing steatosis. The spleen initially exhibited lymphoid hyperplasia, which was followed by lymphoid depletion and increased phagocytosis by splenic macrophages. Focal pancreatic acinar necrosis and spotty adrenal cortical necrosis were seen transiently between days 5 and 7. Viral antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the liver and the spleen. TUNEL analysis showed a dynamic change of hepatocyte necrapoptosis, with activity corresponding to the severity of disease. The histopathologic changes were more severe in younger (subadult) animals. The YF-hamster model appears to be an accurate and inexpensive experimental system for studying the pathophysiology and treatment of YF."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	yellow fever virus	15586900	Yellow fever virus isolated from a fatal post vaccination event: an experimental comparative study with the 17DD vaccine strain in the Syrian hamster (Mesocricetus auratus).	"In order to investigate the pathogenicity of the virus strain GOI 4191 that was isolated from a fatal adverse event after yellow fever virus (YFV) vaccination, an experimental assay using hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) as animal model and YFV 17DD vaccine strain as virus reference was accomplished. The two virus strains were inoculated by intracerebral, intrahepatic and subcutaneous routes. The levels of viremia, antibody response, and aminotransferases were determined in sera; while virus, antigen and histopathological changes were determined in the viscera. No viremia was detected for either strain following infection; the immune response was demonstrated to be more effective to strain GOI 4191; and no significant aminotransferase levels alterations were detected. Strain GOI 4191 was recovered only from the brain of animals inoculated by the IC route. Viral antigens were detected in liver and brain by immunohistochemical assay. Histothological changes in the viscera were characterized by inflammatory infiltrate, hepatocellular necrosis, and viral encephalitis. Histological alterations and detection of viral antigen were observed in the liver of animals inoculated by the intrahepatic route. These findings were similar for both strains used in the experiment; however, significant differences were observed from those results previously reported for wild type YFV strains."	0
mesocricetus auratus	Rodentia	yellow fever virus	16760525	Experimental yellow fever virus infection in the golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) III. Clinical laboratory values.	"Using a recently described hamster model of yellow fever (YF), we compared the hematologic and clinical chemistry changes that occur in blood with the histopathologic alternations observed in liver and other organs. Inflammatory foci and necroapoptotic hepatocytes were first observed in the liver three days after YF infection. This was accompanied by a rapid increase in serum transaminase and bilirubin values, elevation of prothrombin times, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. Maximum liver pathology was observed on the sixth and seventh days post-infection; this corresponded to the peak alternations in clinical chemistry and hematologic values. In surviving hamsters, regenerating hepatocytes began to appear on the eighth day post-infection; this was accompanied by a corresponding return to baseline levels of most of the aforementioned clinical laboratory values. The histopathologic and clinical laboratory findings in the hamster model were very similar to those observed in severe human cases of YF. These results provide further validation of the utility of the hamster model for studying the pathogenesis and treatment of YF."	0

Rift Valley fever virus: A seroepidemiologic study of small terrestrial vertebrates in South Africa. American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 57:693-698.	"Epizootics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) are often associated with periods of heavy rainfall, which are favorable for mosquito vectors. However, in seasons with normal or low rainfall, enzootic circulation occurs, suggesting the existence of a natural host that can act as a cryptic carrier during interepizootic periods. To confirm the role of heavy rainfall in epizootic circulation, and to identify a possible natural host of RVF virus, serum samples from small terrestrial mammals in the Free State and Northern Cape regions of South Africa were collected before and after the 1988 floods. These areas are known to support epizootic circulation of RVF virus. The samples were tested for the presence of RVF virus-specific IgG using an ELISA and positive sera were confirmed by a neutralization test. Forty-seven (15%) of 312 Aethomys namaquensis (Namaqua rock rat) had antibodies to RVF virus. Of these positive sera, nine (6%) of 141 were collected before the floods of 1988 and 38 (22%) of 171 were collected afterwards (P = 0.001). Naive A. namaquensis were inoculated with RVF virus and developed a viremia, but no clinical symptoms, suggesting that they can act as temporary asymptomatic carriers of the virus. These results suggest a role for A. namaquensis as a cryptic carrier for RVF virus during interepizootic periods and support the results of other studies suggesting an amplifying role for heavy rainfall in the circulation of RVF virus."	0
micaelamys namaquensis	Rodentia	rift valley fever phlebovirus	22493102	The role of wild mammals in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus.	"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting primarily domestic ruminants and humans. Numerous vector species are known or implicated in the transmission of RVFV. The role of mammals in the maintenance of RVFV, and the existence of a wild mammal reservoir in the epidemiologic cycle of RVFV, remain largely unknown. Our objective is to present a detailed review of studies undertaken on RVFV, often associated with wild mammals, with the aim of focusing future research on potential reservoirs of the virus. Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of wild ruminants, especially African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), is also discussed. Conflicting results have been published concerning rodents but, based on the literature, the likely candidate species include the African genera Arvicanthis and Micaelamys and the widely introduced roof rat (Rattus rattus). Members of the orders Chiroptera and Rodentia should receive greater attention associated with new research programs. For the other orders mentioned above, few data are available. We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs."	1

"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes one of the most important flavivirus infections of the central nervous system, affecting humans in Europe and Asia. It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected tick and circulates among them and their vertebrate hosts. Until now, TBE risk analysis in Germany has been based on the incidence of human cases. Because of an increasing vaccination rate, this approach might be misleading, especially in regions of low virus circulation., To test the suitability of rodents as a surrogate marker for virus spread, laboratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV and analyzed over a period of 100 days by real-time (RT)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with autochthonous TBE cases, was determined and compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas., In experimentally infected M. arvalis voles, TBEV was detectable in different organs for at least 3 months and in blood for 1 month. Ten percent of all rodents investigated were positive for TBEV. However, in TBE risk areas, the infection rate was higher compared with that of areas with only single human cases or of nonrisk areas. TBEV was detected in six rodent species: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. M. glareolus showed a high infection rate in all areas investigated., The infection experiments proved that TBEV can be reliably detected in infected M. arvalis voles. These voles developed a persistent TBE infection without clinical symptoms. Further, the study showed that rodents, especially M. glareolus, are promising sentinels particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation."	0

"In order to investigate rodent host specificity of European hantaviruses, experimental infection of colonized and wild-trapped rodents was performed. In addition to the natural rodent reservoir, Clethrionomys glareolus, Puumala hantavirus (PUUV) could infect colonized Microtus agrestis and Lemmus sibiricus, but not Syrian hamsters or Balb/C mice. Neither C. glareolus, nor M. agrestis, could be readily infected by Tula hantavirus (TULV). Wild-trapped Apodemus flavicollis and A. agrarius, the natural reservoirs of Dobrava (DOBV) and Saaremaa (SAAV) hantaviruses, respectively, could both be infected by SAAV. NMRI mice could also be infected by SAAV, but with lower efficiency as compared to Apodemus mice. Balb/C and NMRI laboratory mice, but not C. glareolus, could be infected by DOBV. To our knowledge, this is the first time DOBV and SAAV have been shown to infect adult laboratory mice. Moreover, potential hantavirus spillover infections were investigated in wild-trapped rodents. In addition to the natural host C. glareolus, we also found M. arvalis and A. sylvaticus with a history of PUUV infection. We did not find any C. glareolus or A. sylvaticus infected with TULV, a hantavirus which is known to circulate in the same geographical regions of Belgium."	0

"Recent reports of novel hantaviruses in shrews and moles and the detection of rodent-borne hantaviruses in different rodent species raise important questions about their host range and specificity, evolution, and host adaptation. Tula virus (TULV), a European hantavirus, is believed to be slightly or non-pathogenic in humans and was initially detected in the common vole Microtus arvalis, the East European vole M. levis (formerly rossiaemeridionalis), and subsequently in other Microtus species. Here we report the first multiple RT-PCR detection and sequence analyses of TULV in the Eurasian water vole Arvicola amphibius from different regions in Germany and Switzerland. Additional novel TULV S-, M-, and L-segment sequences were obtained from M. arvalis and M. agrestis trapped in Germany at sites close to trapping sites of TULV-RT-PCR-positive water voles. Serological investigations using a recombinant TULV nucleocapsid protein revealed the presence of TULV-reactive antibodies in RT-PCR-positive and a few RT-PCR-negative water voles. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a geographical clustering of the novel S-, M-, and L-segment sequences from A. amphibius with those of M. arvalis- and M. agrestis-derived TULV lineages, and may suggest multiple TULV spillover or a potential host switch to A. amphibius. Future longitudinal studies of sympatric Microtus and Arvicola populations and experimental infection studies have to prove the potential of A. amphibius as an additional TULV reservoir host."	0

"To identify the species of bats involved in maintaining the rabies cycle; to investigate the distribution of the rabies virus in the tissues and organs of bats and the time taken for mortality among inoculated mice., From April 2002 to November 2003, bats from municipalities in the State of São Paulo were screened for the presence of the rabies virus, by means of direct immunofluorescence. The virus distribution in the bats was evaluated by inoculating mice and N2A cells with 20% suspensions prepared from fragments of different organs and tissues, plus the brain and salivary glands. The time taken for mortality among the mice was monitored daily, following intracerebral inoculation., Out of the 4,395 bats received, 1.9% were found positive for the rabies virus. They belonged to ten genera, with predominance of insectivores. The maximum mean times taken for mortality among the mice following inoculation with brain and salivary gland material were 15.33+/-2.08 days and 11.33+/-2.30 days for vampire bats, 16.45+/-4.48 days and 18.91+/-6.12 days for insectivorous bats, and 12.60+/-2.13 days and 15.67+/-4.82 days for frugivorous bats, respectively., The species infected with the rabies virus were: Artibeus lituratus, Artibeus sp., Myotis nigricans, Myotis sp., Eptesicus sp., Lasiurus ega, Lasiurus cinereus, Nyctinomops laticaudatus, Tadarida brasiliensis, Histiotus velatus, Molossus rufus, Eumops sp. and Desmodus rotundus.

"Bats are recognized as a major reservoir of lyssaviruses; however, no bat lyssavirus has been isolated in Asia except for Aravan and Khujand virus in Central Asia. All Chinese lyssavirus isolates in previous reports have been of species rabies virus, mainly from dogs. Following at least two recent bat-associated human rabies-like cases in northeast China, we have initiated a study of the prevalence of lyssaviruses in bats in Jilin province and their public health implications. A bat lyssavirus has been isolated and its pathogenicity in mice and genomic alignment have been determined., We report the first isolation of a bat lyssavirus in China, from the brain of a northeastern bat, Murina leucogaster. Its nucleoprotein gene shared 92.4%/98.9% (nucleotide) and 92.2%/98.8% (amino acid) identity with the two known Irkut virus isolates from Russia, and was designated IRKV-THChina12. Following intracranial and intramuscular injection, IRKV-THChina12 produced rabies-like symptoms in adult mice with a short inoculation period and high mortality. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that IRKV-THChina12 has the same genomic organization as other lyssaviruses and its isolation provides an independent origin for the species IRKV., We have identified the existence of a bat lyssavirus in a common Chinese bat species. Its high pathogenicity in adult mice suggests that public warnings and medical education regarding bat bites in China should be increased, and that surveillance be extended to provide a better understanding of Irkut virus ecology and its significance for public health."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	29079	Poly (A) polymerase activity in L cells following encephalomyocarditis virus infection.	"Poly (A) polymerase activity has been measured in crude cytoplasmic extracts of mouse L cells infected with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. After infection there is first a decrease in enzyme activity followed by an increase which itself precedes detectable virus RNA and protein synthesis. The activity of the enzyme then declines before the release of mature virions and cell death take place. The early inhibition of poly (A) polymerase activity is correlated with the virus-induced shut-off of cellular protein synthesis but it is not due to inhibition of the synthesis of cellular enzyme and occurs in the absence of virus replication. The poly (A) polymerase is not synthesized after infection and modification of its activity can be reversed late in the virus cycle. These results indicate that host poly (A) polymerase activity can be regulated by the virus and further show that there is a correlation between the modification of poly (A) polymerase activity and the biosynthesis of poly (A)."	0

"Extracts of two species of marine algae, Constantinea simplex and Farlowia mollis, were tested for antiviral activity in tissue culture and in experimental infections of mice. Treatment of confluent mouse embryo fibroblast cell monolayers with either compound before viral inoculation was effective in inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, but not encephalomyocarditis virus, Semliki Forest virus, or murine cytomegalovirus. Prophylactic administration of these extracts was effective in reducing final mortality or prolonging the mean day of death of animals inoculated by the intraperitoneal, intracerebral, or intranasal routes with herpes simplex virus type 2. When therapy was initiated after viral inoculation or at a site other than that of viral inoculation, no significant effect on mortality or on mean day of death was observed. Neither preparation was effective in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with encephalomyocarditis virus, Semliki Forest virus, or murine cytomegalovirus or in animals infected intravaginally with herpes simplex virus type 2. The prophylactic but not therapeutic antiviral activity of these preparations seriously limits their potential use in human herpes simplex virus infections."	0

The translational cis-acting elements for ribosomal internal entry into the 5'NTR of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), a member of family Picornaviridae, have been named the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). All of the published experiments regarding the IRES function of the picornavirus 5'NTR, however, were performed with cell extracts in vitro or with tissue culture cells in transient assay systems. In this study, we examined the IRES function of the EMCV 5'NTR in chimeric mouse embryos and demonstrated that this element does in fact work stably in mouse embryos as well as in embryonic stem (ES) cells. By using a dicistronic vector, pWH8, consisting of a promoter-driven neomycin resistance gene (neo) followed by the EMCV 5'NTR-lacZ sequence, we showed that more than half of the ES cells made G418 resistant by the vector stained positive for beta-galactosidase (beta-gal). On Northern (RNA) blots, all of the clones analyzed revealed a transcript of the expected size containing both the beta-gal and the neo cistrons. These results indicate that dicistronic mRNAs are produced from the stably integrated vector in those ES clones and that both of the cistrons are translated to produce functional proteins. The chimeric embryos derived from these ES clones also stained positive for beta-gal, suggesting that the bifunctional mRNAs are active in the embryos. This dicistronic vector system provides a novel tool by which to obtain temporally and spatially coordinated expression of two different genes driven by a single promoter in a single cell in mice."	0

"It is difficult to evaluate the protective efficacy of species-specific viruses of humans and expensive companion animals where there is no non-human animal model. This study describes an in vivo model system which allows simultaneous operation of humoral, cell-mediated, interferon-like or other unidentified immunological defence mechanisms. There was evidence of in vivo inactivation of both enveloped and unenveloped DNA and RNA viruses including retrovirus mouse sarcoma virus/mouse leukaemia virus as evaluated by assay of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This model will allow examination of vaccine efficacy in immunocompetent host animals while avoiding morbidity and/or mortality from virus infection in these animals."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	1660942	Pathogenesis of myocardial injury in myocarditis and cardiomyopathy.	"The pathogenesis of myocardial cell injury in myocarditis and cardiomyopathy was investigated. The presence of viral genomes in the murine heart in experimental coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis was studied by Northern blotting analysis using a 32P-labeled cDNA probe from the 5' end sequence. The strongest signal of positive autoradiograms was always at about 7.4 kilobases, corresponding to the size of the complete genome of the virus. Successive infections with coxsackievirus and encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus infection showed simultaneous acute myocarditis and healed myocarditis, and the results suggest that successive virus infections cause additional myocardial damage, and develop lesions similar to chronic myocarditis or dilated cardiomyopathy. Anti-heart auto-antibody, induced during EMC virus infection, reacted predominantly with myosin. Indium-111 antimyosin scintigraphy showed positive in some of the patients with cardiomyopathy, and the uptake was inversely correlated with left ventricular function. When mice were injected with antimyosin antibody, mouse immunoglobulin G was detected in hearts in the chronic stage of EMC virus myocarditis, in myocytes surrounding fibrosis and calcification, suggesting deposition of antimyosin antibody. Although further study is necessary to clarify the mechanism of uptake of antimyosin in cardiomyopathy, antimyosin antibody may accumulate in viable myocytes with ongoing degeneration as well as in necrosis."	0

"The nucleotide analog 7-deazaguanosine has not previously been reported to possess biological (antiviral or antitumor) properties in cell culture or in vivo. Up to 10(5) U of interferon per ml was detected in mouse sera 1 to 4 h following oral (200-mg/kg of body weight) and intraperitoneal (50-mg/kg) doses of the compound. 7-Deazaguanosine also caused significant activation of natural killer and phagocytic cells but did not augment T- and B-cell blastogenesis. Intraperitoneal treatments of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg/day administered 24 and 18 h before virus inoculation were highly protective in mice inoculated with lethal doses of Semliki Forest or San Angelo viruses. Less but still significant survivor increases were evident in treated mice infected with banzi or encephalomyocarditis viruses. In most cases, the degree of antiviral activity was similar to that exhibited by the biological response modifier 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine. 7-Thia-8-oxoguanosine was more potent than 7-deazaguanosine against encephalomyocarditis virus in mice, however. Oral efficacy was achieved with 7-deazaguanosine treatments of greater than or equal to 100 mg/kg against all virus infections, whereas 7-thia-8-oxoguanosine is reported to be devoid of oral activity in rodents. Thus, 7-deazaguanosine represents the first reported orally active nucleoside biological response modifier exhibiting broad-spectrum antiviral activity against particular types of RNA viruses."	0

Cross-specificity among TMEV substrains and related picornaviruses, but not myelin proteins.	"Following intracerebral inoculation of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), susceptible mouse strains develop a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by mononuclear cell-rich infiltrates in the central nervous system. Current evidence strongly supports an immune-mediated basis for myelin breakdown, with an effector role proposed for TMEV-specific, major histocompatibility class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity, which temporally correlates with disease onset and remains chronically elevated in susceptible mice. This study examined the fine specificity of class II-restricted T cell responses in TMEV-infected mice to better define the relevant virus-encoded T cell determinant(s) responsible for triggering the demyelinating process, and to determine if class II-restricted neuroantigen-specific autoimmune responses could be detected in mice with TMEV-induced demyelination. The data clearly show that T cell responses in TMEV-infected mice are directed against determinants shared by closely related TMEV strains and are cross-reactive with related picornaviruses, such as encephalomyocarditis virus. In contrast, class II-restricted autoimmune responses against syngeneic mouse spinal cord homogenate and the two major protein components of myelin, myelin basic protein and proteolipid protein, are not demonstrable in susceptible SJL/J mice undergoing chronic TMEV-induced demyelinating disease, but are readily seen in SJL/J mice displaying chronic, relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Cross-reactivity (or lack thereof), as determined by functional T cell analyses, was found to correlate with the extent of exact amino acid homology between the TMEV capsid proteins, the two neuroantigens, and related picornaviruses. The data thus do not support a major role for autoimmune responses against myelin proteins in TMEV-induced demyelinating disease, but are consistent with our previously proposed hypothesis that TMEV-specific T cell responses constitute a major effector mechanism of myelin breakdown."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2481700	The role of interferon in the protection of ICR Swiss male mice by the nondiabetogenic variant of encephalomyocarditis virus against virus-induced diabetes mellitus.	"The production of murine diabetes mellitus by the diabetogenic variant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV-D) is prevented in mice preinfected for 24 h with nondiabetogenic virus (EMCV-B). It has been suggested that the protection of the animals is due to the induction of interferon (IFN) by EMCV-B. The present study was done to investigate further the role of IFN in the protection of male ICR Swiss mice against the diabetogenic effects of EMCV-D virus. The results show that this mouse strain is protected only by viable EMCV-B given by either the i.v. or i.p. route of inoculation and that the protection is not abrogated by anti-IFN gamma-globulin. Further, the animals were not protected by either IFN-alpha, IFN- beta, or IFN- alpha/beta at concentrations shown previously to protect mice against the lethal effects of other variants of EMCV. The data provide further evidence that, in the ICR Swiss mouse, IFN does not play a major role in protecting pancreatic beta-cells against infection by EMCV-D."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2560916	Sex-dependent, early cytokine production by NK-like spleen cells following infection with the D variant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV-D).	"Spleen cell cultures from diabetes-resistant ICR Swiss females exhibited an increase in expression of Ia antigens 24 hours post-infection (PI) with EMCV-D while comparable spleen cell cultures from diabetes-susceptible males of this strain did not exhibit this increase in Ia antigens expression. A monoclonal antibody specific for mouse interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) eliminated this increase in Ia antigens expression. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production by EMCV-D-infected spleen cell cultures were monitored at 4-hour intervals for 24 hours. Female spleen cells produced IFN gamma earlier (less than 16 hours PI) and in greater amounts than did comparably treated male spleen cells. Addition of a monoclonal rat anti-mouse IL-2 to virus-infected cultures did not significantly affect the early (less than 16 hours PI) production of IFN gamma by spleen cells of females. Treatment of the spleen cell donors with rabbit anti-asialo GM1 (AAGM1) abolished early production of IFN gamma in virus-infected female spleen cell cultures and reduced the early IL-2 production by infected male and female cells. These results suggest that an NK-like cell is responsible for the early female IFN gamma production; this may be a factor in the resistance of female ICR Swiss mice to EMCV-D-induced diabetes."	0

The highest stimulating effect in vivo was observed with interferon induction 6-8 hours after thymosin administration. An increase in production of both alpha/beta and gamma interferons under the influence of thymosin was observed. Thymosin alone induced no interferon synthesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2822976	Pathogenesis and preventive and therapeutic trials in an animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy induced by a virus.	"An animal model of dilated cardiomyopathy following encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus has been developed. Virus was isolated from mouse hearts and viral antigens were detected in the myocardium until the second week of infection, but neither was found thereafter. Differences were found among different strains of mice in the frequency of occurrence and severity of myocarditis, and even in the character of the pathologic lesions. Thus, genetic factors may play an important role in the pathogenesis. Autoantibodies against heart developed and the distribution of cardiac myosin isoenzymes was altered during the course of myocarditis. Virus, vaccine, maternal vaccination, recombinant interferon alpha A/D and ribavirin were effective in protecting the mice from developing myocarditis. This animal model is suitable for studying the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and evaluating preventive and therapeutic interventions of the condition."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2832359	Asbestos-mediated transfection of mammalian cell cultures.	"The capacity of asbestos to mediate transfection was tested in a rapid and relatively simple system: picornavirus RNAs and mammalian cells in vitro. Thirteen asbestos samples, including amosite, anthophyllite, chrysotile, and crocidolite, 4 picornaviruses (poliovirus 1 and 2, echovirus 7, and encephalomyocarditis virus), and 4 cell lines (CLI, chimpanzee liver; KB, human carcinoma; eta, monkey kidney; NIH 3T3, mouse embryo) were tested. The results showed that all asbestos samples mediated transfection and that all cell lines were transfectible by viral RNA with asbestos. Transfection was much greater with asbestos added to the viral RNA inoculum than to the cells before or after the RNA. Transfection was directly proportional to asbestos concentration. Initiation of transfection events was rapid, with half becoming irreversible by washing 2 min postinoculation. DNA in the inoculum strongly interfered with asbestos-mediated transfection by the RNA but was ineffective when added, with or without asbestos, to the cells before or after the inoculum. Asbestos compared with six classical \"insoluble\" facilitators (bentonite, calcium phosphate, chromic oxide, ferric oxide, kaolin, talc) was of intermediate rank in transfection mediation. It is hypothesized that the prominence of asbestos in carcinogenesis is due to a combination of properties, including transfection mediation as well as chromosome mutagenicity, fiber dimensions, biological durability, hydrocarbon transport, and prevalence."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2981551	The effect of serum deprivation on the initiation of protein synthesis in mouse neuroblastoma cells.	"Growth of mouse neuroblastoma cells becomes stationary when cultured in serum-free medium. Within 60 h, the protein-synthesizing capacity of the cells declines to 25% as compared to that of exponentially growing cells. The transitional activity of the crude ribosomal salt washes from serum-deprived and control cells was compared in in vitro protein-synthesizing pH 5 systems. It appears that the ribosomal salt wash from serum-deprived cells has significantly (70%) lost its ability to support the translation of neuroblastoma poly(A)+ RNA. This activity of the ribosomal wash from serum-deprived cells can be restored to control level with rabbit reticulocyte initiation factor eIF-4B only. The ability of the ribosomal wash from serum-deprived cells to support the translation of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) and Semliki Forest virus (SFV) 42 S mRNA was tested. We found that EMC-mRNA is efficiently translated with the ribosomal salt wash from serum-deprived cells, whereas on the other hand the translation of SFV 42 S mRNA is severely impaired. Therefore, we conclude that in serum-deprived neuroblastoma cells protein synthesis is regulated in both a quantitative and a qualitative way. Modulation of the activity of initiation factor of protein synthesis eIF-4B is at least partly responsible for the observed (selective) blockade of protein synthesis in serum-deprived cells."	0

"Adult male ICR Swiss mice develop insulin-dependent diabetes when infected with the D variant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC-D). In contrast, adult C57Bl/6 males are relatively resistant to the diabetogenic effects of this virus. We have been studying the role of interferon (IFN) in the pathogenesis of infection by EMC-D and development of virus-induced murine diabetes mellitus. The data show that when IFN beta or IFN gamma were administered four days after virus infection, the frequency and severity of diabetes were exacerbated in ICR Swiss mice, and the diabetic state was induced in the resistant C57Bl/6 strain. In addition, animals treated with either of the IFNs or the IFN-inducer poly I:C, developed symptoms of severe encephalomyocarditis. Analysis of ICR Swiss mouse tissues revealed that IFN-treatment resulted in virus replication in the heart and brain and the reappearance of the virus in the pancreas. It is concluded that under certain conditions, the diabetic state is exacerbated and the normal course of (EMC-D)-infection in mice is altered by IFN."	0

After intraperitoneal injection of these compounds in mice, interferon appeared in the circulation. The compounds also protected mice against lethal mengovirus infection and against the development of experimental pox lesions on the tail. Chlorite-oxidized oxyamylose was antiviral only when at least 64% of the glucopyranose units were oxidized, an observation which suggested a correlation between charge density and antiviral effect. The antiviral activity was also influenced by the molecular weight, as demonstrated by the fact that chlorite-oxidized dextrans which had a high intrinsic viscosity were more active than those with low intrinsic viscosity."	0

"Lead acetate was administered continuously in the drinking water to CD-1 male mice beginning at 4 weeks of age. An LD(10-20) of the lytic viruses or 300 plaque-forming units of RLV was inoculated intrapertioneally at 6 weeks of age. Lead increased the response of the mice to all classes of viruses against which it was tested: an RNA picornavirus-encephalomyocarditis (EMCV), a DNA herpesvirus-pseudoribies, an RNA leukemia-virus-Rauscher leukemia (RLV), an RNA arbovirus B-St. Louis encephalitis, and an RNA arbovirus A-western encephalitis. Most studies were performed between lead and EMCV. Increases in EMCV mortality in lead treated mice over controls ranged from 2x at a lead level of 0.004M to 7x (100% mortality) at a 0.1M lead level. Splenomegaly with spleens 800 to 1100 mg in weight containing high titers of RLV occurred in lead (0.03M)-treated mice 3 and 6 weeks after RLV inoculation; spleens or RLV controls were normal in weight (200 mg) and were free of virus. Lead did not reduce the protective effect of mouse interferon (IF) against the lethal action of EMCV, but it did repress the EMCV antiviral effect of poly I/poly C (PIC) and of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) against EMCV mortality. These data indicate several new facts concerning adverse effects lead may have on an animal: (1) lead aggravates viral disease, most likely in part, through reduced IF synthesis; (2) lead represses the anti-EMCV protective effects of both PIC and of NDV, which, in other reports, were shown to induce IF in radioresistant macrophages (PIC) or in radiosensitive lymphocytes (NDV); (3) lead may then be said to repress IF induction in two kinds of cells; (4) however, lead does not inhibit IF action."	0

It was shown that peritoneal cells from mice with mild course of the infection (infecting dose 0.2-1.0 LD50 per mouse) produce interferon in vitro on the same level as the control cells. Alveolar cells isolated from the same mice shortly after infection exhibited increased interferon production in vitro as compared with the analogous cells isolated from the non-infected mice. Acute, EMC-induced infection in mice (infecting dose 5.0 LD50 per mouse) caused suppression of interferon synthesis in vitro by both peritoneal and alveolar cells, which intensified together with the progression of the disease."	0

"The present study concerns the effect of the experimental diabetogenic encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus on normal and athymic nude mice of BALB/c origin. The effect of simultaneous immunosuppressive pharmacological treatment with a derivative of cyclophosphamide in a relatively low dose (3 mg/mouse) was also studied. After inoculation with EMC virus, 36% of the normal mice, but none of the nude mice, developed diabetes mellitus and 93% of the normal mice, but none of the nude mice, developed paresis of one or more leg(s). When lower doses of EMC virus were given, few or none of the normal mice developed diabetes or paresis. After treatment with a cyclophosphamide-derivative, the number of paralysed mice increased. EMC virus in abundant amounts could be isolated from the pancreas and heart of all virus-inoculated mice, including the non-diabetic nude mice. Antibodies against EMC virus were found in all groups of virus-inoculated mice, although only in small amounts in nude and immunosuppressed normal mice. Histological examination revealed no significant differences between the islets of Langerhans of the experimental mice, diabetic as well as non-diabetic, and the control mice with respect to lymphocytic infiltration. It is concluded that the thymus-dependent immune system seems to be of decisive importance for the development of diabetes in this virus model."	0

"The D variant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV-D) is used in the murine model to study virus-induced, acute-onset diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and myocarditis. In this model, viral replication and disease occur within seven days post infection (p.i.), and by Day 10 p.i., no infectious virus is detectable. The present study examined the possibility that EMCV-D persists in ICR-Swiss mice after the acute infection is resolved. The data show that viral antigen is detected at 28 days p.i. within the pancreatic islets of 8/10 males and 13/14 females, and within the heart valves of all animals tested. Histologic examination of the organs at 28 days p.i. suggests the development of chronic obstructive pancreatitis, and shows almost fully healed lesions in the myocardium. These observations indicate that the murine model for the study of EMCV-D induced IDDM may be extended to investigate chronic pancreatitis and heart-valve disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	8406584	Inhibition of interferon-gamma by an interferon-gamma receptor immunoadhesin.	"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) is an important cytokine which regulates inflammatory and immune response mechanisms. IFN-gamma enhances the presentation and recognition of antigens by inducing the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, by activating effector T cells and mononuclear phagocytes, and by modulating immunoglobulin production and class selection in B cells. Inappropriate production of IFN-gamma has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and in graft rejection. Here, we describe a recombinant inhibitor of IFN-gamma, termed murine IFN-gamma receptor immunoadhesin (mIFN-gamma R-IgG). We constructed this immunoadhesin by linking the extracellular portion of the mouse IFN-gamma R to the hinge and Fc region of an IgG1 heavy chain. Murine IFN-gamma R-IgG is secreted by transfected cells as a disulphide-bonded homodimer which binds IFN-gamma bivalently, with high affinity and in a species-specific manner. In vitro, mIFN-gamma R-IgG can block mIFN-gamma-induced antiviral activity and expression of the class I MHC antigen H-2Kk in cultured cells. In vivo, mIFN-gamma R-IgG can block the function of endogenous mIFN-gamma in mouse models of infection with Listeria monocytogenes and of contact sensitivity. These results show that mIFN-gamma R-IgG is an effective and specific inhibitor of mIFN-gamma both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, in general, IFN-gamma receptor immunoadhesins may be useful for investigating the biological functions of IFN-gamma as well as for preventing deleterious effects of IFN-gamma in human disease."	0

"We have expressed recombinant human interferon-alpha 2b in mammalian cells and isolated cell lines constitutively secreting very high levels of biologically active protein. The expression system takes advantage of the strong human cytomegalovirus immediate early promoter in mouse myeloma NSo cells and glutamine synthetase as a selectable marker; spontaneous mutants with amplified gene copy numbers were selected by growth of primary transfectants in the presence of methionine sulfoximine. Using this procedure, we have isolated a recombinant NSo cell line which secretes human interferon at the rate of 20 micrograms/10(6) cells/24 h and accumulates up to 120 micrograms/ml (approximately 2.4 x 10(7) U/ml) following prolonged undiluted culture. The interferon (IFN) could be efficiently purified on a polyclonal bovine anti-human IFN alpha specific antibody column and the glycosylation pattern was found to be similar to that of nonrecombinant IFN alpha 2b purified from virus-induced human Namalwa cells. The biological activity of the recombinant material was indistinguishable from that of natural IFN from Namalwa cells, and the specific antiviral activity, as assayed on human HeLa cells challenged with encephalomyocarditis virus, was 2 x 10(8) IU/mg, similar to that of nonrecombinant IFN preparations. This represents the highest reported level of glycosylated, recombinant IFN expression in a stable mammalian system and is a significant advance in the large-scale production of these clinically important cytokines."	0

mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	9464576	The use of cytokine inhibitors. A new therapeutic insight into heart failure.	"Cytokines are being increasingly recognized as important factors in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of heart failure. Elevated levels of circulating cytokines have been reported in patients with heart failure, and various cytokines have been shown to depress myocardial contractility in vitro and in vivo. We have recently compared the effects on cytokine production of drugs for therapy of heart failure that have different effects on survival. Amrinone, pimobendan and vesnarinone, phosphodiesterase III inhibitors that have been shown to have short term haemodynamic benefits, inhibited TNF-alpha production. Differential modulation of the production of IL-1beta and IL-6 was observed; amrinone and pimobendan enhanced the production of IL-1beta, whereas vesnarinone did not. As inotropic agents differentially modulate cytokine production, these agents may interfere with induction of inducible nitric oxide (NO) synthase through an inhibition of cytokine formation. Although differential modulation of the production of NO by inotropic agents may explain their different effect in patients with heart failure, further study is necessary to reach this conclusion. We have shown that amlodipine increases the survival of mice with viral myocarditis and inhibits expression of inducible NO synthase and production of NO in vivo and in vitro. The therapeutic effect of amlodipine may in part result from inhibition of overproduction of NO. As we learn more about the pathophysiological and pathogenetic role of cytokines in heart failure, it should be possible to design better and more targeted pharmacological agents. Furthermore, the investigation of inotropic agents that are effective against the production of cytokines may help in the classification of these agents."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	9548400	Combination of OK432 and human interferon-alpha for treating viral-induced diabetes mellitus in mice.	"We investigated the therapeutic effects of OK432 (picibanil; CAS39325-1-4), an immunomodulator that is derived from the Su strain of Streptococcus pyogenes. This agent was administered alone or combined with human interferon-alpha in a murine model of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Interferon-alpha inhibits viral replication, reducing the incidence of virus-induced IDDM. Groups of DBA/2 mice (N = 25 per group) received an intraperitoneal injection of OK432 and interferon-alpha daily for 16 d beginning 1 d after inoculation with 500 plaque-forming units of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The dose of OK432 was one clinical unit (corresponding to 0.1 mg dried cells) per mouse, and that of interferon-alpha was 1 x 10(4) u/g. The animals were killed at random at 3 or 7 d after inoculation with EMCV. The survival rate of mice treated with the combination of OK432 and with interferon-alpha was significantly greater than that of the non-treated infected control animals (P < 0.01). Fasting levels of blood glucose were significantly lower in the mice administered the combination, than in the controls, both on day 3 (68 +/- 21 mg/dl vs. 270 +/- 135 mg/dl, P < 0.01) and on day 7 (101 +/- 29 mg/dl vs. 219 +/- 112 mg/dl, P < 0.01). Serum levels of insulin were significantly higher in the treated mice than in the controls (65 +/- 5 vs. 55 +/- 1 microU/ml, P < 0.05). However, in the mice treated with OK432 or interferon-alpha alone, the survival rate and the blood level of glucose and insulin did not differ from those of infected controls. Natural killer (NK) cell activity was significantly higher in the mice treated with the drug combination than in the controls on both days evaluated: day 3, 65 +/- 5 vs. 55 +/- 1%, n = 3, P < 0.05; day 7, 44 +/- 3 vs. 22 +/- 8%, n = 3, P < 0.05). Serum levels of murine interferon in the treated mice exceeded those in controls on both days evaluated (day 3, 671 U/ml vs. 442 U/ml; day 7, 57 U/ml vs. 43 U/ml). There were no significant differences in NK cell activity or in the interferon level in mice treated with either OK432 or interferon-alpha alone as compared with the infected, non-treated controls. Results suggest that the combination of OK432 and interferon-alpha protects against virally induced IDDM by increasing the activity of NK cells as well as the plasma level of interferon."	0

"Gender bias favoring female resistance to picornavirus disease is not seen in ICR Swiss mice following infection with the MM strain of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (causing encephalitis and death) as it is with D variant of EMCV (causing diabetes in males). To define this difference, an in vitro virus-infected splenocyte culture system was used to explore virus effects on lymphoid cells. Infected and sham-infected splenocyte cultures, prepared from both genders of mice and infected with either virus variant, were examined for immunoregulatory cytokines in the first 24 h of infection using ELISA or bioassays. Disease resistance was associated with increased levels of interferon-y (IFN-gamma) and undetectable levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by 12 h postinfection in splenocytes from ICR Swiss females infected with EMCV-D. Disease susceptibility was associated with high levels of IL-10 at 12 h after infection of spleen cells from ICR Swiss males infected with EMCV-D or from both genders infected with EMCV-MM. This information was used to protect susceptible mice against picornavirus disease (either diabetes or death) by giving them an inducer of IFN-alpha/beta, to induce natural killer (NK)-like cells to produce high levels of IFN-gamma and rat monoclonal anti-IL-10 to neutralize the effects of mouse IL-10."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	10077396	Increased severity of viral myocarditis in mice lacking lymphocyte maturation.	"The role of lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis is controversial. To better understand how lymphocyte maturation controls a virus-induced myocarditic process, a murine model of viral myocarditis was utilized. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was inoculated intraperitoneally into three kinds of mice; virus-susceptible C57BL/6, virus-resistant 129/SV and recombination activity gene (RAG)-2 knockout 129/SV mice. The RAG2 participate in the maturity of T and B lymphocytes. Survival rate, heart weight (HW), HW to body weight (BW) ratio, viral genome, cardiac inflammation and myocardial necrosis were evaluated after EMCV (500 plaque forming unit/mouse) inoculation. On post-inoculation day 10, the survival rate of C57BL/6, 129/SV and RAG2 knockout mice were 42, 90 and 0%, respectively. Myocardial viral titer was significantly (P<0.05) higher in C57BL/6 and RAG2 knockout mice than in 129/SV mice. In situ hybridization demonstrated the EMCV genome in the myocardium of RAG2 knockout and C57BL/6 mice, but not in 129/SV mice. At day 8, HW and HW/BW ratios were elevated (P<0.05) in RAG2 knockout mice as well as C57BL/6 mice compared with 129/SV mice. Myocardial necroses were more severe in RAG2 knockout mice than in wild-type 129/SV mice. In conclusion, matured lymphocytes protect the development of viral myocarditis which includes viral replication and myocardial apoptosis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	10193745	Pimobendan inhibits the production of proinflammatory cytokines and gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in a murine model of viral myocarditis.	"This study was designed to examine the effects of pimobendan in a murine model of viral myocarditis in relation to proinflammatory cytokine production and nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) in the heart., Pimobendan has been recently confirmed to improve both acute and chronic heart failure. Since the modulation of myocardial necrosis and contractile dysfunction by various proinflammatory cytokines may be partially mediated by the production of nitric oxide, the effects of pimobendan on the production ofproinflammatory cytokines and NO were investigated in an animal model of viral myocarditis involving heart failure., DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the encephalomyocarditis virus. To observe its effect on survival up to 14 days, pimobendan (0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) or vehicles were given from the day of virus inoculation (day 0) orally once daily. The effects of pimobendan on histological changes, cytokine production, NO production and iNOS gene expression in the heart were studied in mice treated either with pimobendan, 1 mg/kg or with vehicles only, and sacrificed seven days after virus inoculation., The survival of mice improved in a dose-dependent fashion such that a significant difference (p < 0.02) was found between the higher-dose pimobendan group (20 of 30 [66.7%]) and the control group (11 of 30 [36.7%]). Histological scores for cellular infiltration (1.1+/-0.1 vs. 2.0+/-0.0, p < 0.001), intracardiac tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (18.2+/-1.8 vs. 35.8+/-4.2 pg/mg heart, p < 0.001) and interleukin (IL)-1beta (9.3 +/-1.2 vs. 26.6+/-7.1 pg/mg heart, p < 0.01) were significantly lower in the mice given pimobendan versus those of the control mice. Interleukin-6 levels (7.1+/-0.8 vs. 9.2+/-1.9 pg/mg heart) were also lower in the mice treated with pimobendan. Furthermore, intracardiac NO production was significantly (p < 0.001) less in the pimobendan group (0.165+/-0.004 nmol/mg heart) than in the control group (0.291+/-0.051 nmol/mg heart), and intracardiac iNOS gene expression in the mice given pimobendan was 74% lower than it was in the control animals (p < 0.01)., These findings suggest that the beneficial effects of pimobendan in viral myocarditis are partially mediated by the inhibition of both proinflammatory cytokine production and NO synthesis by iNOS."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	10231757	Murine viruses in an island population of introduced house mice and endemic short-tailed mice in Western Australia.	"House mice (Mus domesticus) were recently introduced to Thevenard Island, off the northwest coast of Western Australia. This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M. domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. Pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M. domesticus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	10770641	Construction of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector expressing murine interleukin-12 (IL-12).	"IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine that is known to induce tumor regression and long-term antitumor immunity. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors are advantageous for gene therapy in that they lack pathogenicity in humans, infect dividing as well as nondividing cells, and show a broad range of infectivity. We constructed an rAAV vector expressing interleukin-12 (IL-12) for cancer immunotherapy studies in a mouse model by inserting murine IL-12 (mIL-12) p35 and p40 cDNAs into the plasmid pRep4 and inserting the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site between the p35 and p40 cDNAs. The mIL-12 expression cassette containing the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and a simian virus 40 polyadenylation signal was subcloned into the AAV plasmid p008Sub/NeoR, which contains two AAV inverted terminal repeat sequences and the NeoR gene driven by the thymidine kinase promoter. rAAV virions (10(4) infectious particles/ml) were generated by cotransfection of rAAV-mIL-12 and a helper plasmid (pAAV/Ad) into 293 cells previously infected with adenovirus 5. After infection of D6 fibroblasts with rAAV-mIL-12, G418-resistant clones were isolated. Each of the 1D D6 clones isolated produced up to 5.2 ng/10(6) cells/48 hours of mIL-12 as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Induction of interferon-gamma, enhanced lymphocyte proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays confirmed biologically functional IL-12 production by the vector. This is the first report indicating that an rAAV vector expresses mIL-12, which can be used to model the effects of mIL-12 alone and/or in combination with other antitumor agents."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	10807532	Therapy with the nonpeptide endothelin receptor antagonist 97-139 in a murine model of congestive heart failure: reduction of cardiac mass and myofiber hypertrophy.	"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoconstrictor. This peptide exerts numerous effects on the heart, including regulation of cardiomyocyte growth during hypertrophy. The effects of the structurally novel, nonpeptide, ET-1-selective, competitive antagonist (ETA) 97-139 were investigated in mice with congestive heart failure (CHF) and myocardial hypertrophy. Morphological and microscopical analyses were conducted on day 56 after viral inoculation following 28 day treatment with 99-139. Eight week-old DBA2 mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus at a dose of 500 pfu/mouse. The 30 mice were divided into two groups--an ETA treated group and an untreated group. Heart weight (HW) in the infected group was significantly (p < 0.05) increased compared to that in the uninfected group. HW and the HW/body weight (BW) ratio were significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the ETA treated group compared with the untreated group (HW; 127.7 +/- 6.2 mg vs 144.3 +/- 4.2 mg, HW/BW; 4.9 +/- 0.9 x 10(-3) vs 5.4 +/- 0.5 x 10(-3)). Myofiber diameter in the ETA treated group was significantly reduced compared with the untreated group (12.1 +/- 1.5 microm vs 14.3 +/- 1.9 microm). These results suggest the ET-1 receptor antagonist 97-139 has an effect on the reduction of cardiac mass and myofiber hypertrophy, and that 97-139 may be a useful agent for CHF due to viral myocarditis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	10862831	Oral administration of branched chain amino acids improves virus-induced glucose intolerance in mice.	"We investigated the therapeutic effect of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) on mice with glucose intolerance induced by encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Male DBA/2 mice were divided into three groups: treated with BCAA, (such as valine, leucine, and isoleucine), untreated, and control. BCAA-treated and -untreated groups were inoculated intraperitoneally with the NDK25 variant of EMCV at 200 plaque-forming units per mouse. The BCAA-treated group was administered orally 0.9 g/kg/day of each BCAA from the day after viral inoculation. The control group neither received virus inoculation nor was treated with BCAA. One week after inoculation, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed. After the glucose loading at 1.5 g/kg of body weight, blood glucose levels in the untreated group were 92.0+/-10.0 mg/dl at baseline, 224.6+/-10.9 mg/dl at 30 min, and 169.4+/-21.4 mg/dl at 60 min, which were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those in the control group (62. 7+/-3.6 mg/dl, 167.2+/-16.4, and 83.8+/-6.0 mg/dl, respectively). Blood glucose levels in the BCAA-treated group were 54.5+/-3.7 mg/dl at baseline, 145.2+/-8.7 mg/dl at 30 min, and 128.7+/-18.3 mg/dl at 60 min after the glucose loading, which were not significantly higher than those in the control group. Immunoreactive insulin levels at 30 min after the glucose loading were lower in the untreated group than in the control group at 1 week after virus inoculation. Histological investigations showed that the grade of insulitis in the pancreas of mice of the BCAA-treated group was lower than that of the mice of the untreated group. These results suggest that oral administration of BCAA is able to improve glucose intolerance induced by EMCV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	11156888	Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) plays a protective role in acute viralmyocarditis in mice: A study using mice lacking TNF-alpha.	"It has been reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is expressed in the heart with viral myocarditis and that its expression aggravates the condition. The pathophysiological effects of TNF-alpha on viral myocarditis, however, have not been fully elucidated., To investigate the role of TNF-alpha in the progression of viral myocarditis, we used TNF-alpha gene-deficient mice (TNF-alpha(-/-)) and induced acute myocarditis by infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The survival rate of TNF-alpha(-/-) mice after EMCV infection was significantly lower than that of TNF-alpha(+/+) mice (0% versus 67% on day 14). Injection of recombinant human TNF-alpha (0.2 to 4.0 microg/mouse IV) improved the survival of TNF-alpha(-/-) mice in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that TNF-alpha is essential for protection against viral myocarditis. The levels of viral titer and viral genomic RNA of EMCV in the myocardium were significantly higher in TNF-alpha(-/-) than in TNF-alpha(+/+) mice. Histopathological examination showed that the inflammatory changes of the myocardium were less marked in TNF-alpha(-/-) than in TNF-alpha(+/+) mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the levels of immunoreactivity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 in the myocardium were decreased in TNF-alpha(-/-) mice compared with TNF-alpha(+/+) mice., These observations suggested that TNF-alpha is necessary for adhesion molecule expression and to recruit leukocytes to inflammatory sites, and thus, the lack of this cytokine resulted in failure of elimination of infectious agents. We concluded that TNF-alpha plays a protective role in the acute stage of viral myocarditis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	11421463	Tannins and related compounds: killing of amastigotes of Leishmania donovani and release of nitric oxide and tumour necrosis factor alpha in macrophages in vitro.	"The antileishmanial and immunomodulatory potencies of a series of 28 polyphenols were evaluated in terms of extra- and intracellular leishmanicidal activity and macrophage activation for release of nitric oxide (NO), tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon (IFN)-like properties. For this, several functional bioassays were employed including an in vitro model for leishmaniasis in which murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMphi) were infected with the obligate intracellular parasite Leishmania donovani, an extracellular Leishmania proliferation assay, a fibroblast-lysis assay (TNF-activity), and a biochemical assay for NO. Except for gallic acid, its methyl ester, shikimic acid and catechin (EC50 25.8-67.9 nM) all polyphenols tested significantly inhibited the intracellular survival of L. donovani amastigotes (EC50 0.4-13.9 nM) when compared with the clinically used agent, sodium stibogluconate (EC50 10.6 nM). In contrast, none of the samples proved to be directly toxic for the extracellular promastigote form of the parasite. Noteworthy, the phenolic samples showed only moderate or no cytotoxicity against the murine host cells (EC50 10 to >144 nM). Although NO is an important effector molecule in macrophage microbicidal activity, the inducing potential of the test compounds for its release was found to be very moderate ranging from 7-54 microM (IFN-gamma/LPS 119 microM). On the other hand, inhibition of NO production had no apparent effect on intracellular leishmanicidal activity of polyphenols. Their in vitro TNF-inducing potential producing 50% lysis in murine L929 cells increased in the order of simple phenols and flavanols (34-48 U/ml) < A-type proanthocyanidins (53-80 U/ml) < B-type proanthocyanidins (64-200 U/ml) < hydrolyzable tannins (287-350 U/ml) at the host cell subtoxic concentration of 50 microg/ml. Furthermore, gallic acid and some hydrolyzable tannins showed appreciable IFN-like activities (14-23 U/ml) as reflected by inhibition of the cytopathic effect of encephalomyocarditis virus on fibroblast L 929 cells. The results provide a rational basis for the recorded anti-infectious efficacy of traditionally used herbal medicines containing tannins in vivo, in the light of both only moderate direct antimicrobial activities of distinct polyphenols in vitro and the limited knowledge on their uptake in humans."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	14550273	Analysis of T-cell receptor Vbeta gene from infiltrating T cells in insulitis and myocarditis in encephalomyocarditis virus-infected BALB/C mice.	"Encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus induces insulin-dependent diabetes and myocarditis in several strains of mice. The T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta genes of infiltrating T cells in the pancreas and myocardium of BALB/C mice infected with EMC virus D-variant (EMC-D virus) were analyzed. Using a nested two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TCR Vbeta cDNAs were cloned and sequenced. Two and four kinds of TCR Vbeta clones were obtained from T cells infiltrating into the pancreas and myocardium of BALB/C mice infected with EMC-D virus, respectively. The infiltrating lymphocytes in the diabetic mice expressed Vbeta 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 genes predominantly. Previously, the use of Vbeta 8.2 has been reported in autoimmune diseases such as murine experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse. This study suggests that mice infected with EMC virus are a useful animal model for autoimmune diseases such as insulin-dependent diabetes."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	14578624	Gene expression of cardiac mast cell chymase and tryptase in a murine model of heart failure caused by viral myocarditis.	"This study examined the gene expression of mouse mast cell proteases to clarify their role in the pathophysiology of viral myocarditis. Male DBA/2 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with the encephalomyocarditis virus and the gene expression of mast cell chymase, mouse mast cell protease (mMCP)-4 and -5, and tryptase, mMCP-6, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and type-I procollagen was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The gene expression of mMCP-4, -5 and -6 mRNA was increased at 5 days, and continued to increase to day 14, coinciding with a prominent inflammatory reaction and extensive myocardial necrosis and fibrosis. The gene expression of MMP-9 was also increased, and there was a significant correlation between upregulation of mast cell proteases and MMP-9. The gene expression of type-I procollagen was increased at 5 days and continued to increase to day 14, suggesting that a fibrotic process had already begun during the acute stage of viral myocarditis. These findings suggest that mast cell chymase and tryptase participate in the acute inflammation and remodeling process of viral myocarditis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	14984720	Suppression of cytokines and nitric oxide production, and protection against lethal endotoxemia and viral myocarditis by a new NF-kappaB inhibitor.	"Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) is activated by several factors, which increase the inflammatory response, and this activation, in turn, leads to the expression of several genes such as cytokines, and may play an important role in cardiovascular diseases., The aim of the study is to examine the effect of SUN C8079, a newly synthesized NF-kappaB inhibitor in vitro and in vivo., We examined the effects of SUN C8079 on the transcriptional responses of NF-kappaB, on activation of NF-kappaB in electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and on the gene expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and iNOS. We also studied effects of SUN C8079 on lethal endotoxemia and viral myocarditis in mice., SUN C8079 inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of the genes of TNF-alpha and iNOS by inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB in vitro. SUN C8079 inhibited the systemic release of TNF-alpha and improved mortality in LPS-treated mice. In addition to protecting mice against lethal endotoxemia, SUN C8079 prevented the development of myocarditis due to the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), and inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and the iNOS gene in cardiac tissues., These findings suggest that the activation of NF-kappaB plays an important role in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia and viral myocarditis, and that the NF-kappaB inhibitor, SUN C8079, may be therapeutic in these disorders."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	15215053	Characteristics of testicular lesions in mice infected with a low dose of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus.	"We investigated the characteristics of testicular lesions induced in mice with a low dose (10 plaque forming units/mouse) of the D variant of encephalomyocarditis (EMC-D) virus. The virus titers of blood and testis peaked at 5 days post-inoculation (5 DPI) and were no longer detected at 14 DPI. The IFN-gamma and iNOS mRNAs expression in the testis and spleen detected by RT-PCR was prominently elevated at 7 DPI, although the expression level of TNF-alpha mRNA was not affected. Signals of viral RNA were clearly detected in degenerative germinal epithelia (in situ hybridization) at 7 DPI, which were surrounded by a small number of macrophages and a few CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells (immunohistochemistry). Signals were no longer detected at 21 DPI when seminiferous tubules were highly degenerative and accompanied with infiltration of many macrophages and a small numbers of CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. At 35 DPI, marked atrophy of germinal epithelia composed of Sertoli cells alone was observed, and there were almost no infiltrating cells detected. The present results suggest that macrophages may play an important role in the development of testicular lesions induced in mice with a low dose of EMC-D."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	15240179	Leptin deficiency enhances myocardial necrosis and lethality in a murine model of viral myocarditis.	"To investigate the role of leptin in the development of viral myocarditis and cardiac necrosis, we used a murine model of viral myocarditis. We intraperitoneally injected encephalomyocarditis virus (500 plaque-forming units/mouse) for wild type C57 BL/6 mice (WT) and leptin-deficient ob/ob mice (OB) (n = 20 for each). Ten-day survival rate was 25% in OB, whereas it was 95% in WT. Heart weights on day 10 were significantly elevated in OB compared with those in WT (107.2 +/- 9.4 vs. 96.6 +/- 7.9 mg, n = 4 for each). Thymus weights were significantly diminished in OB compared with those in WT on days 6 and 10. Histological score (grade 1 to 4 according to the size of involved area) for myocardial necrosis were significantly higher in OB than in WT (1.5 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.5, n = 4 for each). On day 4, viral titer in hearts was significantly elevated in OB compared with that in WT (3.3 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.2 TCID50/mg, n = 3 for each). Comparative expression of TNF-alpha mRNA in hearts from OB were significantly increased compared with those in WT on day 7 (n = 3 for each). Natural killer cell activities in spleens from OB were significantly lower than from WT on day 4 (27 +/- 5 vs. 42 +/- 8%, n = 4 for each). Thus, leptin deficiency could enhance severity of myocardial necrosis and mortality due to viral myocarditis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	16107267	Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 enhances myocardial damage in a mouse model of viral myocarditis.	"To determine critical role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) for development of viral myocarditis, a mouse model of encephalomyocarditis virus-induced myocarditis was used. The virus was intraperitoneally given to COX-2 gene-deficient heterozygote mice (COX-2+/-) and wild-type mice (WT). We examined differences in heart weights, cardiac histological scores, numbers of infiltrating or apoptotic cells in myocardium, cardiac expression levels of COX-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and adiponectin mRNA, immunoreactivity of COX-2, TNF-alpha, and adiponectin in myocytes, cardiac concentrations of TNF-alpha and adiponectin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels in hearts, and viral titers in tissues between COX-2+/- and WT. We observed significantly decreased expression of COX-2 mRNA and reactivity in hearts from COX-2+/- on day 8 after viral inoculation as compared with that from WT, together with elevated cardiac weights and severe inflammatory myocardial damage in COX-2+/-. Cardiac expression of TNF-alpha mRNA, reactivity, and protein on day 8 was significantly higher in COX-2+/- than in WT, together with reciprocal expression of adiponectin mRNA, reactivity, and protein in hearts. Significantly reduced cardiac PGE2 levels on day 8 were found in COX-2+/- compared with those in WT. There was no difference in local viral titers between both groups on day 4. Infected WT treated with a selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS-398, also showed the augmented myocardial damage on day 8. These results suggest that inhibition of COX-2 may enhance myocardial damage through reciprocal cardiac expression of TNF-alpha and adiponectin in a mouse model of viral myocarditis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	16479046	Impaired expression of cardiac adiponectin in leptin-deficient mice with viral myocarditis.	"A mouse model of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus-induced myocarditis was used to investigate the expression of adiponectin in damaged cardiomyocytes. We intraperitoneally injected EMC virus into leptin-deficient ob/ob (OB) mice and wild-type (WT) mice. OB mice were divided into two subgroups consisting of mice with no intervention and mice receiving leptin replacement starting simultaneously with viral inoculation. We determined differences in heart weight, cardiac histological score, numbers of infiltrating and apoptotic cells in the myocardium, expression levels of adiponectin and TNF-alpha mRNA in the heart, adiponectin immunoreactivity in myocytes, adiponectin and TNF-alpha concentrations in the heart, and immunoreactivity of adiponectin receptors in myocytes between OB mice and WT mice. There was significantly decreased adiponectin mRNA expression, immunoreactivity, and protein level in the heart, and reduced immunoreactivity of adiponectin receptor 1 in myocytes from OB mice on days 4 and 8 after viral inoculation as compared with those in WT mice, together with increased cardiac weight, severe inflammatory myocardial damage, and increased levels of cardiac TNF-alpha mRNA and protein. Replacement of leptin in OB mice inhibited the development of severe myocarditis through augmentation of adiponectin mRNA, immunoreactivity, and protein level, increased adiponectin receptor 1 immunoreactivity in myocytes, and suppressed levels of TNF-alpha mRNA and protein. These results suggest that impaired expression of cardiac adiponectin may contribute to the progression of viral myocarditis through enhanced expression of TNF-alpha under a leptin-deficient condition."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	16603526	Cardiovirus leader proteins are functionally interchangeable and have evolved to adapt to virus replication fitness.	"The leader (L) proteins encoded by picornaviruses of the genus Cardiovirus [Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) and Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV)] are small proteins thought to exert important functions in virus-host interactions. The L protein of persistent TMEV strains was shown to be dispensable for virus replication in vitro, but crucial for long-term persistence of the virus in the central nervous system of the mouse. The phenotype of chimeric viruses generated by exchanging the L-coding regions was analysed and it was shown that the L proteins of neurovirulent and persistent TMEV strains are functionally interchangeable in vitro and in vivo, despite the fact that L is the second most divergent protein encoded by these viruses after the L* protein. The L protein encoded by EMCV and Mengo virus (an EMCV strain) shares about 35 % amino acid identity with that of TMEV. It differs from the latter by lacking a serine/threonine-rich C-terminal domain and by carrying phosphorylated residues not conserved in the TMEV L protein. Our data show that, in spite of these differences, the L protein of Mengo virus shares, with that of TMEV, the ability to inhibit the transcription of type I interferon, cytokine and chemokine genes and to interfere with nucleocytoplasmic trafficking of host-cell proteins. Interestingly, analysis of viral RNA replication of the recombinant viruses raised the hypothesis that L proteins of TMEV and EMCV diverged during evolution to adapt to the different replication fitness of these viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	17963525	Long term expression of bicistronic vector driven by the FGF-1 IRES in mouse muscle.	"Electrotransfer of plasmid DNA into skeletal muscle is a promising strategy for the delivery of therapeutic molecules targeting various muscular diseases, cancer and lower-limb ischemia. Internal Ribosome Entry Sites (IRESs) allow co-expression of proteins of interest from a single transcriptional unit. IRESs are RNA elements that have been found in viral RNAs as well as a variety of cellular mRNAs with long 5' untranslated regions. While the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES is often used in expression vectors, we have shown that the FGF-1 IRES is equally active to drive short term transgene expression in mouse muscle. To compare the ability of the FGF-1 IRES to drive long term expression against the EMCV and FGF-2 IRESs, we performed analyses of expression kinetics using bicistronic vectors that express the bioluminescent renilla and firefly luciferase reporter genes. Long term expression of bicistronic vectors was also compared to that of monocistronic vectors. Bioluminescence was quantified ex vivo using a luminometer and in vivo using a CCD camera that monitors luminescence within live animals., Our data demonstrate that the efficiency of the FGF-1 IRES is comparable to that of the EMCV IRES for long term expression of bicistronic transgenes in mouse muscle, whereas the FGF-2 IRES has a very poor activity. Interestingly, we show that despite the global decrease of vector expression over time, the ratio of firefly to renilla luciferase remains stable with bicistronic vectors containing the FGF-1 or FGF-2 IRES and is slightly affected with the EMCV IRES, whereas it is clearly unstable for mixed monocistronic vectors. In addition, long term expression more drastically decreases with monocistronic vectors, and is different for single or mixed vector injection., These data validate the use of bicistronic vectors rather than mixed monocistronic vectors for long term expression, and support the use of the FGF-1 IRES. The use of a cellular IRES over one of viral origin is of particular interest in the goal of eliminating viral sequences from transgenic vectors. In addition, the FGF-1 IRES, compared to the EMCV IRES, has a more stable activity, is shorter in length and more flexible in terms of downstream cloning of second cistrons. Finally, the FGF-1 IRES is very attractive to develop multicistronic expression cassettes for gene transfer in mouse muscle."	0

"Inflammation contributes to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associated with activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. The aim of this study was to investigate whether eplerenone, a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist, has anti-inflammatory effects on viral myocarditis., Four-week-old inbred male DBA/2 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 10 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus. Mice were fed with standard chow (control) or with chow containing 2.5 mg/kg of eplerenone, starting either on day 0 (inoculation) or day 7. Survival at 28 days was significantly higher in the mice which started eplerenone treatment on day 0 (35 vs. 15% in controls, each n = 40, P < 0.05). The area of myocardial fibrosis on day 28 was significantly smaller in the eplerenone-treated mice than in controls (19.8 +/- 2.6%, n = 14, vs. 33.4 +/- 5.4%, n = 6, mean +/- SEM, P < 0.05). Gene expression of mouse mast cell proteases-4 and -5, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and type I procollagen on day 6 after EMC virus inoculation was significantly decreased in the hearts of eplerenone-treated mice., These results suggest that eplerenone has anti-inflammatory effects, and exerts its beneficial effects on viral myocarditis by suppression of genes related to mast cells and cardiac remodelling in the hearts of mice."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	21307205	The IRF-3/Bax-mediated apoptotic pathway, activated by viral cytoplasmic RNA and DNA, inhibits virus replication.	"Induction of apoptosis in cells infected by Sendai virus (SeV), which triggers the cytosolic RIG-I pathway, requires the presence of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Independent of IRF-3's transcriptional role, a novel IRF-3 activation pathway causes its interaction with the proapoptotic protein Bax and its mitochondrial translocation to induce apoptosis. Here we report that two other RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), may also activate the same pathway. Moreover, cytosolic DNA, produced by adenovirus or introduced by transfection, activated the pathway in an RNA polymerase III-dependent fashion. To evaluate the contribution of this newly discovered apoptotic pathway to the host's overall antiviral response, we measured the efficiencies of replication of various viruses in vitro and viral pathogenesis in vivo, using cells and mice that are selectively deficient in components required for the apoptotic pathway of IRF-3. Our results clearly demonstrate that the IRF-3/Bax-mediated apoptotic signaling branch contributes significantly to the host's protection from viral infection and consequent pathogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cardiovirus b	19870629	SPONTANEOUS ENCEPHALOMYELITIS OF MICE, A NEW VIRUS DISEASE.	"1. The characteristics of a filterable virus obtained from mice found spontaneously paralyzed and showing lesions of encephalomyelitis are described. 2. The course of the disease in mice, following intracerebral inoculation, is briefly as follows: After an incubation period varying from 7 to over 30 days a flaccid paralysis of one of the limbs appears. This paralysis usually spreads rapidly until all four limbs are affected. Young mice are more susceptible than older ones, and very young mice, less than 4 weeks of age, usually die without showing signs of paralysis. 3. Adult mice often show no signs of infection after an intracerebral inoculation of virus. A number of these mice, although showing no signs of paralysis, nevertheless have become infected, a fact which is demonstrated by recovery of the virus from the mice as well as by histopathological studies. 4. Intranasal instillation of the virus is the only other method of producing the infection. This method, however, produces paralysis in only a small percentage of the mice. Following intranasal instillation of the virus, there often develops a slight immunity to a subsequent intracerebral injection of virus. 5. The paralysis in the surviving mice recedes gradually, but a permanent residual paralysis, usually of the hind legs, is almost invariable. Such mice, however, are virus carriers, as the virus can be recovered from the spinal cord for 1 year after infection. 6. Paralyzed mice are immune to a subsequent intracerebral injection of the virus. There is evidence that neutralizing substances are present in the immune mice. A considerable proportion of the mice which have remained well after an intracerebral injection of virus are immune to a second injection. 7. The virus resists the action of 50 per cent glycerine at from 2-4 degrees C. for at least 150 days. It passes all grades of Berkefeld filters with ease. By the use of graded collodion filters, the size of the virus particle has been determined to be probably about 13 to 19 mmicro. 8. The virus of mouse encephalomyelitis is not pathogenic for rhesus monkeys. No evidence of immunological relationship with the virus of human poliomyelitis has been obtained. 9. The anatomical basis of the paralysis is an acute necrosis of the ganglion cells of the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Isolated ganglion cells of the cerebrum also undergo necrosis. Following the acute necrosis of the ganglion cells, there is a marked neuronophagia. A perivascular infiltration is observed in the brain and spinal cord."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	6290850	Mechanism of antibody-mediated protection against herpes simplex virus infection in athymic nude mice: requirement of Fc portion of antibody.	"Experiments were performed to investigate the resistance of the host due to antibody-mediated mechanisms to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Transfer of hyperimmune anti-HSV mouse serum inhibited the development of skin lesions and prolonged the survival of lethally HSV-infected nude mice. Relatively high concentrations of antibody were required to achieve this protection. Antisera prepared in heterologous animals were also effective, while administration of anti-cowpox virus serum or interferon provided no protection. This type of protection is therefore due to specific antibody and cannot be attributed to interferon. In order to delineate the requirement for antibody in antibody-mediated protection, human gamma globulin preparations were transferred to lethally HSV-infected nude mice. Transfer of intact human gamma globulin (GG) was effective in controlling infection. S-sulfonation of GG did not diminish the protective ability. However, purified F(ab')2 did not have any protective action even when it was administered frequently to maintain serum neutralizing antibody titer. GG was effective in C5-deficient mice lethally infected with HSV. These results indicate that in vivo antibody-mediated protection to HSV infection requires the Fc region of the intact IgG molecule and suggest that antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity may be operative in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	10435631	The zinc finger protein A20 interacts with a novel anti-apoptotic protein which is cleaved by specific caspases.	"A20 is a Cys2/Cys2 zinc finger protein which is induced by a variety of inflammatory stimuli and which has been characterized as an inhibitor of cell death by a yet unknown mechanism. In order to clarify its molecular mechanism of action, we used the yeast two-hybrid system to screen for proteins that interact with A20. A cDNA fragment was isolated which encoded a portion of a novel protein (TXBP151), which was recently found to be a human T-cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) Tax-binding protein. The full-length 2386 bp TXBP151 mRNA encodes a protein of 86 kDa. Like A20, overexpression of TXBP151 could inhibit apoptosis induced by tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in NIH3T3 cells. Moreover, transfection of antisense TXBP151 partially abolished the anti-apoptotic effect of A20. Furthermore, apoptosis induced by TNF or CD95 (Fas/APO-1) was associated with proteolysis of TXBP151. This degradation could be inhibited by the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk or by expression of the cowpox virus-derived inhibitor CrmA, suggesting that TXBP151 is a novel substrate for caspase family members. TXBP151 was indeed found to be specifically cleaved in vitro by members of the caspase-3-like subfamily, viz. caspase-3, caspase-6 and caspase-7. Thus TXBP151 appears to be a novel A20-binding protein which might mediate the anti-apoptotic activity of A20, and which can be processed by specific caspases."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	10705388	A mouse model of aerosol-transmitted orthopoxviral disease: morphology of experimental aerosol-transmitted orthopoxviral disease in a cowpox virus-BALB/c mouse system.	"To determine the morphologic changes and disease progression of aerosolized cowpox virus infection in BALB/c mice and to ascertain the suitability of cowpox virus-infected BALB/c mice as a model of aerosol-transmitted, orthopoxviral respiratory disease., BALB/c mice were inoculated with cowpox virus, Brighton strain, by aerosol or intranasal route. Mice were killed at specified times after inoculation, necropsied, and tissues were collected for routine histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy., Inoculation by both routes resulted in disease and death. Immunolabeled viral antigen and lesions predominated in the tissues associated with the inoculation route, that is, lungs, airways, trachea, and nasal passages and sinuses. Tracheitis was evident in the intranasally infected group only. Lesions were generally necrotizing and hemorrhagic, neutrophilic, and increased in extent and severity in a time-dependent fashion. Viral intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, immunolabeled viral antigen, or virions were readily seen in epithelial tissues, smooth muscle cells of airways and vessels, fibroblasts, periosteal cells, perineural cells, and macrophages. Although the extension of infection appeared to be primarily direct, lesions suggesting hematogenous dissemination were occasionally noted in bone marrow and skin. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated features of cell injury or death, virion assembly and maturation, and both A-type and B-type inclusions., Aerosol inoculation of BALB/c mice with cowpox virus provides a reliable and facilitative model of aerosol-transmitted, orthopoxviral respiratory disease."	0

"Eight novel single amino acid (6-11) and dipeptide (12, 13) tyrosine P-O esters of cyclic cidofovir ((S)-cHPMPC, 4) and its cyclic adenine analogue ((S)-cHPMPA, 3) were synthesized and evaluated as prodrugs. In vitro IC(50) values for the prodrugs (<0.1-50 μM) vs vaccinia, cowpox, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex type 1 virus were compared to those for the parent drugs ((S)-HPMPC, 2; (S)-HPMPA, 1; IC(50) 0.3-35 μM); there was no cytoxicity with KB or HFF cells at ≤100 μM. The prodrugs exhibited a wide range of half-lives in rat intestinal homogenate at pH 6.5 (<30-1732 min) with differences of 3-10× between phostonate diastereomers. The tyrosine alkylamide derivatives of 3 and 4 were the most stable. (l)-Tyr-NH-i-Bu cHPMPA (11) was converted in rat or mouse plasma solely to two active metabolites and had significantly enhanced oral bioavailability vs parent drug 1 in a mouse model (39% vs <5%)."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	1682924	Construction of intertypic chimeric dengue viruses by substitution of structural protein genes.	"Dengue virus contains an 11-kilobase positive-strand RNA genome that codes for, in one open reading frame, three structural proteins (capsid, premembrane, and envelope), followed by seven nonstructural proteins. The structural protein genes of a full-length cDNA clone of type 4 dengue virus were replaced with the corresponding genes of dengue 1 or dengue 2 to create intertypic chimeric cDNA. The RNA transcripts made from these templates were infectious when transfected into permissive cells in culture. Progeny of chimeric cDNA produced apparently authentic dengue 1 or dengue 2 structural proteins, together with dengue 4 nonstructural proteins, and as a consequence exhibited type 1 or type 2 serological specificity. Both of the chimeras ultimately grew to the same titer as their type 1 or type 2 parent, but the type 2/type 4 chimera grew very slowly. This chimera also produced small plaques; in contrast, the type 1/type 4 chimera produced normal size plaques. The type 2/type 4 chimera retained the mouse neurovirulence of the dengue 2 virus, which was the source of its structural protein genes. Each of the mice inoculated intracerebrally with the chimera died, but survival time was prolonged. The retardation of replication of the type 2/type 4 chimeric virus suggests that this virus and possibly other intertypic dengue virus chimeras with similar properties should be examined for attenuation in primates and possible usefulness in a live dengue virus vaccine for humans."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	2889443	Maturation process of Japanese encephalitis virus in cultured mosquito cells in vitro and mouse brain cells in vivo.	"The maturation process of Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus in C6/36 cells in vitro and in mouse brain cells in vivo was studied by electron microscopy. In the C6/36 cell infection, 500 to 2250 virions per cell were released into the medium during the period of study; yet, no virus budding process was observed at the host cell membranes. JE virions at various maturation stages appeared within the cisternae of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) of infected cells at 24 hours p.i.; and, although C6/36 cells did not show a well-developed Golgi apparatus, the virions appeared to be carried to the cell surface within host-cell secretory vesicles for extracellular release as early as 24 hours p.i. The occurrence of a secretory-type intracellular transport of maturing JE virus particles was well recognizable in brain cells of infected mice, in which JE virus particles were found almost exclusively in the cisternae of RER, in the Golgi apparatus, and in various vesicles, including coated vesicles, in the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus. Our previous study of dengue-2 virus morphogenesis and our present study of JE virus morphogenesis differed substantially at various stages of maturation. Possible mechanisms which explain these differences were discussed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	4594115	Dengue virus infection of mice: morphology and morphogenesis of dengue type-2 virus in suckling mouse neurones.	"In dengue type-2 virus-infected neurones of suckling mice, formation of single-membrane vesicles is observed in the distended cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum mostly of the perinuclear zone around 72 h after inoculation. Electron-dense 50-nm virus particles are arranged in chains in these distended cisternae; some form small crystalloid aggregates. Aberrant particles of different shapes are also seen in the distended cisternae about the same time that the virus particles appear. Parallel filamentous structures are occasionally observed in the cisternae that contain very few virions, either characteristic or aberrant. Increasing cytopathic changes are present after 75 to 96 h. There is an intense vesicular formation. Large numbers of virions and aberrant particles are seen either in the endoplasmic reticulum cisternae or smooth membrane vesicles. They are spread throughout the neurocytoplasm, extending into the dendrites. Dengue virions which are enclosed in fairly intact membrane-bound vesicles are released during cytolysis of the neurones. Morphogenesis of dengue virus type 2 is discussed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	7073959	Depressed macrophage functions in dengue virus-infected mice: role of the cytotoxic factor.	"Dengue virus Type 2 (DV) infection causes immunosuppression in mice. Since macrophages are crucial for immune response, we have studied their functions in this condition and report our findings here. It was observed that in DV-infected mice the phagocytosis of neutral-red and latex particles by splenic and peritoneal-cavity macrophages was significantly reduced (P less than 0.001) from Days 3 to 10 after inoculation. Similarly the migration of splenic and peritoneal macrophages on a glass surface was reduced significantly (P less than 0.001) from Days 4 to 10 after inoculation. Pre-treatment of normal mouse spleen cells with DV-induced cytotoxic factor (CF) inhibited the phagocytic and migratory functions in the same way as observed in DV-infected mice. Higher dilutions of CF (10(-3) and 10(-3.7)) did not kill the cells but affected their functions. It was concluded that macrophage functions are affected by killing and metabolic changes in these cells by DV-induced CF, thus producing immunosuppression."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	7176969	Dengue virus multiplication in cultures of mouse peritoneal macrophages: effects of macrophage activators.	"Dengue-2 virus multiplied in cultures of methylcellulose-induced peritoneal macrophages of BALB/c mice. The in vitro-cultivated macrophages from dengue-1 virus-immune mice produced larger amounts of dengue-2 virus than did those from nonimmune controls. The effect of macrophage activators was examined by using nonimmune macrophages. Enhanced virus production was demonstrated in cultures of macrophagges pretreated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The number of virus-infected cells in the pretreated cultures was estimated to be about 0.01% or less of the total macrophages. Continuous treatment of macrophages with PHA before and after virus inoculation brought about the most marked enhancement of dengue-2 virus multiplication. On the other hand, treatment with concanavalin A or pokeweed mitogen showed little effect on the multiplication of the same virus. Treatment with carrageenan, a specific macrophage blocking agent, markedly suppressed dengue-2 virus production in both dengue-1 virus-immune macrophages and LPS-treated macrophages. The indirect fluorescent-antibody (FA) technique revealed dengue-2 viral antigen in the cytoplasm of infected macrophages, and the FA-positive macrophages were more numerous in PHA-treated cultures than in untreated controls. The results obtained are discussed in relation to a possible role of activated monocytes/macrophages in the pathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	10544083	Development of a novel mouse model for dengue virus infection.	"In the present study, we established an animal model for dengue virus infection using severe combined immunodeficient mice transplanted with a human hepatocarcinoma cell line (HepG2). At 7-8 weeks after transplantation, the HepG2-grafted mice were infected intraperitoneally with dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2). A higher titer of the virus was detected in the liver and serum but not in the brain in the early stage of postinfection. When the mice showed paralysis, the highest titer of virus was detected in the serum and brain. DEN-2 antigens were also found in HepG2 cells of the liver in the early stage and some neurons of the brain in the late stage. Upon clinical examination, thrombocytopenia, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and increased hematocrit, blood urea nitrogen, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were seen in the paralyzed mice. Moreover, mild hemorrhage in the liver and tarry stool in the small intestine were observed in some mice. Our results show some similarities to human DEN infection and this mouse model might be valuable for studying some aspects of pathogenesis of this disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	12610141	Yellow fever virus/dengue-2 virus and yellow fever virus/dengue-4 virus chimeras: biological characterization, immunogenicity, and protection against dengue encephalitis in the mouse model.	"Two yellow fever virus (YFV)/dengue virus chimeras which encode the prM and E proteins of either dengue virus serotype 2 (dengue-2 virus) or dengue-4 virus within the genome of the YFV 17D strain (YF5.2iv infectious clone) were constructed and characterized for their properties in cell culture and as experimental vaccines in mice. The prM and E proteins appeared to be properly processed and glycosylated, and in plaque reduction neutralization tests and other assays of antigenic specificity, the E proteins exhibited profiles which resembled those of the homologous dengue virus serotypes. Both chimeric viruses replicated in cell lines of vertebrate and mosquito origin to levels comparable to those of homologous dengue viruses but less efficiently than the YF5.2iv parent. YFV/dengue-4 virus, but not YFV/dengue-2 virus, was neurovirulent for 3-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation; however, both viruses were attenuated when administered by the intraperitoneal route in mice of that age. Single-dose inoculation of either chimeric virus at a dose of 10(5) PFU by the intraperitoneal route induced detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies against the homologous dengue virus strains. Mice which had been immunized in this manner were fully protected from challenge with homologous neurovirulent dengue viruses by intracerebral inoculation compared to unimmunized mice. Protection was associated with significant increases in geometric mean titers of neutralizing antibody compared to those for unimmunized mice. These data indicate that YFV/dengue virus chimeras elicit antibodies which represent protective memory responses in the mouse model of dengue encephalitis. The levels of neurovirulence and immunogenicity of the chimeric viruses in mice correlate with the degree of adaptation of the dengue virus strain to mice. This study supports ongoing investigations concerning the use of this technology for development of a live attenuated viral vaccine against dengue viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	12620809	Enhancing biosynthesis and secretion of premembrane and envelope proteins by the chimeric plasmid of dengue virus type 2 and Japanese encephalitis virus.	"We have constructed a series of plasmids encoding premembrane (prM) and envelope (E) protein genes of dengue virus type 2 (DEN-2). These plasmids included an authentic DEN-2 prM-E construct (pCBD2-14-6), and two chimeric constructs, 90% DEN-2 E-10% Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus E (pCB9D2-1J-4-3) and 80% DEN-2 E-20% JE E (pCB8D2-2J-2-9-1). Monoclonal antibody (MAb) reactivity indicated that all three plasmids expressed authentic DEN-2 virus E protein epitopes representative of flavivirus domains 1, 2, and 3. However, only the pCB8D2-2J-2-9-1 construct secreted high levels of prM, M (membrane), and E proteins into the culture fluid of plasmid-transformed COS-1 cells. The major portion of the prM and E proteins expressed by COS-1 cells transformed by pCBD2-14-6 or pCB9D2-4-3 plasmids remained membrane-bound. The results supported the notion that an unidentified membrane retention sequence is located between E-397 and E-436 of DEN-2 virus E protein. Replacing the carboxyl-terminal 20% of DEN-2 E (397-450) with the corresponding JE sequence had no effect on anti-DEN-2 MAb reactivity, indicating that this region is antigenically inert, although it is required for antigen secretion. Plasmid pCBD2-2J-2-9-1, which expressed secreted forms of prM/M and E that have the potential to form subviral particles, was superior to other constructs in stimulating an antibody response. Ninety percent neutralization titers ranging from 1:40 to >1:1000 were observed in seven of nine serum specimens from pCB8D2-2J-2-9-1-immunized mice. Eleven of twelve 2-day-old neonatal mice, derived from a pCB8D2-2J-2-9-1 immunized female mouse, survived intraperitoneal challenge of DEN-2 New Guinea C virus."	0

"In this study we established a mouse brain injection system to detect infectious dengue-2 virus produced from the full-length RNA transcripts., In vitro transcription was used to synthesize full-length dengue-2 virus RNA from the plasmid pRS424FLDEN2NGC, which was intracerebrally injected into the 6-day-old suckling mice (ICR strains). Engineered dengue-2 viruses were detected in the brain sections using immunohistochemistry staining. RT-PCR followed by restriction endonuclease BstEII digestion was used to confirm the mosquito C6/36 cells cocultured with the mouse brain extract., The mice inoculated with the full-length dengue-2 viral RNA transcript showed paralysis symptoms and died between day 10 and 13 postinjection. The dengue-2 virus-specific antigens (E, Core and NS1) were detected in all the brain and part of the liver sections of the paralyzed mice by immunohistochemistry staining, indicating the existence of dengue-2 virus in these tissues of the suckling mice. The viruses detected in the brains of suckling mice were indeed infectious, which was further confirmed by coculturing mosquito C6/36 cells with the brain extract of the injected mice., We developed an in vivo approach to detect and produce engineered dengue viruses with infectivity from the full-length plasmid cDNA. This suckling mice system will also aid in screening the infectious viruses that are created by site-directed mutagenesis and is useful for the studies of dengue virus gene function and pathogenesis in the host."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	15837370	Induction of protective antibodies against dengue virus by tetravalent DNA immunization of mice with domain III of the envelope protein.	"Dengue fever is a growing public health concern around the world and despite vaccine development efforts, there are currently no effective dengue vaccines. In the present study we report the induction of protective antibodies against dengue virus by DNA immunization with domain III (DIII) region of the envelope protein (E) in a mouse model. The DIII region of all four dengue virus serotypes were cloned separately into pcDNA 3 plasmid. Protein expression was tested in COS-7 cells. Each plasmid, or a tetravalent combination, were used to immunize BALB/c mice by intramuscular route. Presence of specific antibodies was evaluated by ELISA, and neutralizing antibodies were tested using a cytopathogenic effect (CPE) inhibition assay in BHK-21 cells, as well as in newborn mice challenged intracranially with dengue 2 virus. Mice immunized with individual DIII constructs or the tetravalent formulation developed antibodies against each corresponding dengue serotype. Antibody titers by ELISA were similar for all serotypes and no significant differences were observed when boosters were administered, although antibody responses were dose-dependent. CPE inhibition assays using Den-2 virus showed neutralization titers of 1:10 in mice immunized with individual DIII plasmid or those immunized with the tetravalent formulations. 43% of newborn mice challenged with Den-2 in combination with sera from mice immunized with Den-2 DIII plasmid were protected, whereas sera from mice immunized with the tetravalent formulation conferred 87% protection. Our results suggest that DIII can be used as a tetravalent DNA formulation to induce neutralizing and protective antibodies against dengue virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	20369024	The development of therapeutic antibodies that neutralize homologous and heterologous genotypes of dengue virus type 1.	"Antibody protection against flaviviruses is associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies against the viral envelope (E) protein. Prior studies with West Nile virus (WNV) identified therapeutic mouse and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognized epitopes on domain III (DIII) of the E protein. To identify an analogous panel of neutralizing antibodies against DENV type-1 (DENV-1), we immunized mice with a genotype 2 strain of DENV-1 virus and generated 79 new MAbs, 16 of which strongly inhibited infection by the homologous virus and localized to DIII. Surprisingly, only two MAbs, DENV1-E105 and DENV1-E106, retained strong binding and neutralizing activity against all five DENV-1 genotypes. In an immunocompromised mouse model of infection, DENV1-E105 and DENV1-E106 exhibited therapeutic activity even when administered as a single dose four days after inoculation with a heterologous genotype 4 strain of DENV-1. Using epitope mapping and X-ray crystallographic analyses, we localized the neutralizing determinants for the strongly inhibitory MAbs to distinct regions on DIII. Interestingly, sequence variation in DIII alone failed to explain disparities in neutralizing potential of MAbs among different genotypes. Overall, our experiments define a complex structural epitope on DIII of DENV-1 that can be recognized by protective antibodies with therapeutic potential."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	dengue virus	21658241	Structural mutants of dengue virus 2 transmembrane domains exhibit host-range phenotype.	"There are over 700 known arboviruses and at least 80 immunologically distinct types that cause disease in humans. Arboviruses are transmitted among vertebrates by biting insects, chiefly mosquitoes and ticks. These viruses are widely distributed throughout the world, depending on the presence of appropriate hosts (birds, horses, domestic animals, humans) and vectors. Mosquito-borne arboviruses present some of the most important examples of emerging and resurgent diseases of global significance., A strategy has been developed by which host-range mutants of Dengue virus can be constructed by generating deletions in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the E glycoprotein. The host-range mutants produced and selected favored growth in the insect hosts. Mouse trials were conducted to determine if these mutants could initiate an immune response in an in vivo system., The DV2 E protein TMD defined as amino acids 452SWTMKILIGVIITWIG467 was found to contain specific residues which were required for the production of this host-range phenotype. Deletion mutants were found to be stable in vitro for 4 sequential passages in both host cell lines. The host-range mutants elicited neutralizing antibody above that seen for wild-type virus in mice and warrant further testing in primates as potential vaccine candidates., Novel host-range mutants of DV2 were created that have preferential growth in insect cells and impaired infectivity in mammalian cells. This method for creating live, attenuated viral mutants that generate safe and effective immunity may be applied to many other insect-borne viral diseases for which no current effective therapies exist."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	828047	Cytotoxic T cells recognize very early, minor changes in ectromelia virus-infected target cells.	"Target cells (P-815 mastocytoma cells) infected with ectromelia virus became susceptible to lysis by H-2 compatible specific effector T cells within one hour of exposure of the cells to virus. This is long before viral progeny are produced and shed from the cell. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) profiles of the plasma membranes from infected and uninfected P-815 cells pulsed with 35S-methionine for one or a few hours after infection with virus were very complex and showed no consistent differences. P-815 cells, infected with ectromelia virus in the presence of an inhibitor of protein synthesis, pactamycin, slowly became susceptible to cell mediate lysis when the pactamycin was removed. The number of polypeptide species synthesized under these conditions was reduced to only three, of molecular weights between 10,000-50,000 daltons. Specific, newly synthesized membrane components recognized by mouse convalescent sera were isolated by immune complexing and examined by PAGE. Six polypeptide bands were seen, the major one correlating with one observed in the pactamycin experiment. The results suggested that the convalescent serum recognized both viral and host cell coded antigens. The significance of these findings is discussed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	2888283	Biologic properties and genome structure of the recombinants between ectromelia and rabbitpox viruses.	"Administration of rabbitpox virus (RPV) DNA, cleaved into 2 fragments by SmaI restrictase, into ectromelia virus (EMV)-infected chick fibroblast cells yielded recombinants whose properties were characteristic of both parents. Some recombinants capable of producing RPV-type lesions upon intracutaneous (i.c.) infection of rabbits could also produce EMV-specific lesions upon footpad inoculation of mice. The analysis of some recombinants as well as vaccinia virus strains has shown that the ability of the virus to reproduce when injected into the mouse footpad is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for production of EMV-type lesions. According to restrictase analysis of recombinant DNA, the genome of recombinants mainly consists of RPV DNA sequences with insertions of small EMV DNA fragments."	0

BALB/c mice inoculated subcutaneous (s.c.) or intranasally (i.n.) had high mortality. Most mice died within 7 days from severe necrosis of the spleen and liver. Necrotic foci in livers of BALB/c mice that survived beyond 7 days often were accompanied by mononuclear cell infiltrates and by hyperplasia of lymphoid tissues. C57BL/6 mice inoculated by either route remained asymptomatic and necrotic lesions were mild or absent, whereas focal non-suppurative hepatitis and lymphoid hyperplasia were prominent. Infectious virus and viral antigen were distributed widely in tissues of BALB/c mice, but had limited distribution in C57BL/6 mice. Both mouse strains had infection of the respiratory tract, genital tract, oral tissues and bone marrow, and BALB/c mice also had infection of the intestines. Both strains also developed serum antibody to vaccinia virus antigen after infection. The results show that ectromelia virus occurs in tissues conducive to mouse to mouse transmission and that the severity and character of mousepox lesions correlate directly with resistance and susceptibility to infection. They also support the concept that cellular immunity contributes to survival from infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	3035276	Observations on the replication of ectromelia virus in mouse-derived cell lines: implications for epidemiology of mousepox.	"Ectromelia virus was shown to replicate in vitro in all lymphoma cell lines and in a small proportion of hybridoma lines tested. It was demonstrated that certain hybridoma cell lines, which were passed in ectromelia virus-infected mice, yielded ectromelia virus infectivity on explantation into tissue culture. This finding further substantiated the belief that ascitic fluid and hybridoma cell lines exposed to virus during mouse-passage could be important in the epidemiology of mousepox."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	6161603	Synergic effects of interferon and interferon inducer against ectromelia virus infection in mice.	"Intraperitoneal injection of mouse brain interferon into mice 24 hr before inoculation of ectromelia virus, significantly reduced the mortality rate and prolonged the mean day of death (MDD). Intravenous injection of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) 24 hr before virus inoculation, also had significant beneficial effects. Furthermore, combined treatment with interferon and NDV had more protective effect against virus infection than either interferon or NDV treatment alone."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	6170256	Combined protective effects on interferon and interferon induction on herpes simplex and ectromelia virus infections in mice.	"Mouse interferon or the induction of mouse interferon with polyriboinosinic acid-polyribocytidylic acid significantly protected mice against herpes simplex and ectromelia viral infections. When polyriboinosinic acid-polyribocytidylic acid was administered 24 h before herpes simplex or ectromelia viral infection and mouse interferon was administered shortly before and 24 h after infection, a combined protective effect against either herpes simplex or ectromelia viral infection in mice was evident. There was a significant decrease in the mortality rate with the combined treatment as compared either with the rate in group treated with interferon or polyriboinosinic acid-polyribocytidylic acid."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	6281560	Clinical, pathologic, and serologic features of an epizootic of mousepox in Minnesota.	"An epizootic of mousepox in two colonies of mice was described. Clinical signs, morbidity and mortality rates, and necropsy lesions were substantially influenced by husbandry practices, intercurrent diseases (Sendai pneumonia, mouse hepatitis virus), and total body x-irradiation. In one colony, 54 mice were necropsied; 19 mice had cutaneous or visceral lesions of mousepox although none had combined visceral and cutaneous lesions. In the other colony, 20 mice were necropsied, and 10 mice had cutaneous lesions; none had visceral lesions. Sera from 24 mice with the cutaneous form of the disease had no demonstrable HI antibody titer. Experimental mice injected with spleen/liver homogenates from infected colony mice developed typical visceral lesions with numerous poxvirus profiles on electron micrographs and positive HI titers. Mice immunized with vaccinia virus were not susceptible to the disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	6311733	H-2-linked control of resistance to ectromelia virus infection in B10 congenic mice.	"Several B10 strains of mice, recombinant at the H-2 locus, have been shown to differ in their resistance to infection with ectromelia virus, a natural mouse pathogen. Of 10 strains, B10, B10.A(2R), B10.A(4R) and B10.D2 were the most resistant, while B10.G and B10.A(5R) were the most susceptible. Other strains were intermediate between these extremes. Several genes conferring resistance have been mapped to Db in B10.A(2R), Kk I-Ak I-Bk in B10.A, I-Jb in B10.A(2R) and to Dd in B10.T(6R). In general, death among susceptible strains was not a consequence of acute liver necrosis as in other non-B10 strains, and occurred randomly from 8-14 days after infection. The exact cause of death is unknown but is characterized by persisting high titers of virus in the spleen and sometimes the liver, despite an ongoing immune response indicated by strong cytotoxic T-cell activity detectable in the spleens of all mice. The most resistant B10 and B10.A(2R) strains cleared virus from the spleen and liver by 8 days after infection. Analysis of infection in chimeric mice indicates that H-2 genes, which determine susceptibility to virus persistence in the spleen, operate via radiosensitive cells of the lymphomyeloid system. This evidence, together with several examples of H-2-linked differences in cytotoxic T-cell responsiveness between resistant and susceptible strains, is consistent with the hypothesis that the mechanism by which H-2 genes control resistance to ectromelia virus in B10 strain mice is by their influence on the effectiveness of a cell-mediated immune response."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	7831964	Fine mechanisms of ectromelia virus thymidine kinase-negative mutants avirulence.	"Three independently selected spontaneous thymidine kinase-negative mutants (TK-phenotype) and a recombinant with Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene (LacZ+ phenotype) inserted in the viral thymidine kinase gene (tk) were derived from a plaque-cloned isolate of K-1 ectromelia virus strain (TK+ phenotype). Dramatically decreased virulence of TK- variants was observed for all routes of mouse inoculation. The kinetics of TK+ and TK- variants in various target organs indicated a significant decrease of production and dissemination of TK- mutants and recombinant in the organs of mice. In the spleen and liver of intranasally or intracerebrally infected mice TK- virus was not detected during the entire period of observation. Analysis of organs homogenates of mice intranasally infected by a mixture of recombinant with TK-LacZ+ phenotype and parental isolate with TK+LacZ- phenotype on the monolayers of TK- cells indicated that only white plaques (LacZ-) with the TK+ phenotype appeared from liver and spleen homogenates. Thus, the mouse acts as a live filter much more efficiently than any other selective systems. Ultrastructural studies showed that viral damage in animals infected by TK- variants was far less than that observed in mice, infected with wild type of ectromelia virus and pathological lessions were slight and reversible. Replication of ectromelia virus TK- variants was blocked at the viroplasma stage in cells with a high level of differentiation in contrast to TK+ variants. Most likely, such restriction of target cells assortment is the general reason of reduced virulence in the case of tk-gene inactivation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	10231757	Murine viruses in an island population of introduced house mice and endemic short-tailed mice in Western Australia.	"House mice (Mus domesticus) were recently introduced to Thevenard Island, off the northwest coast of Western Australia. This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M. domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. Pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M. domesticus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	11514717	Vaccinia virus semaphorin A39R is a 50-55 kDa secreted glycoprotein that affects the outcome of infection in a murine intradermal model.	"Vaccinia virus (VV) protein A39R has amino acid similarity to the extracellular domain of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface semaphorin (SEMA7A/CDw108) that has an immunological expression profile and binding properties, thereby implicating A39R as an immunomodulator. Previously, a closely related A39R protein expressed by ectromelia virus was shown to induce cytokine production and up-regulate ICAM-1 expression in mouse monocytes in vitro. In this study, we show that the A39R gene of VV strain Copenhagen (COP) encodes a 50-55 kDa secreted glycoprotein and is expressed late during infection. The A39R protein was secreted by eight of 15 strains of VV, but not by strain Western Reserve (WR). To analyse the VV A39R function, several recombinant viruses were made, including an A39R deletion mutant of VV COP and a WR mutant containing the A39R sequence from COP. Loss of the gene from COP did not affect virus growth in vitro, or VV virulence in a mouse intranasal model, and had only a slight effect on lesion size in an intradermal model. In contrast, expression of COP A39R by VV WR was associated with an increase in the severity and persistence of skin lesions after intradermal infection of mice. Finally, a histological examination of mouse skin infected with recombinant viruses suggested that A39R has direct or indirect pro-inflammatory properties."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	12235215	Inhibition of type 1 cytokine-mediated inflammation by a soluble CD30 homologue encoded by ectromelia (mousepox) virus.	"CD30 is up-regulated in several human diseases and viral infections but its role in immune regulation is poorly understood. Here, we report the expression of a functional soluble CD30 homologue, viral CD30 (vCD30), encoded by ectromelia (mousepox) virus, a poxvirus that causes a severe disease related to human smallpox. We show that vCD30 is a 12-kD secreted protein that not only binds CD30L with high affinity and prevents its interaction with CD30, but it also induces reverse signaling in cells expressing CD30L. vCD30 blocked the generation of interferon gamma-producing cells in vitro and was a potent inhibitor of T helper cell (Th)1- but not Th2-mediated inflammation in vivo. The finding of a CD30 homologue encoded by ectromelia virus suggests a role for CD30 in antiviral defense. Characterization of the immunological properties of vCD30 has uncovered a role of CD30-CD30L interactions in the generation of inflammatory responses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	12625512	Administration of vaccinia virus to mice may cause contact or bedding sentinel mice to test positive for orthopoxvirus antibodies: case report and follow-up investigation.	"Routine testing of bedding sentinels from a barrier room revealed one mouse seropositive to ectromelia virus (EV). Results of hemagglutination-inhibition testing and western blot analysis were confirmatory for orthopoxvirus antibodies. Additional seropositive animals were not identified. Interviews indicated that replication-competent vaccinia virus (VV), Western Reserve strain (VV-WR), recently had been given to mice. Although VV-WR was not expected to spread by contact or via fomites, the case evidence suggested transmission of vaccinia via soiled bedding. In a follow-up experiment, 15 index mice were inoculated with 10(7) plaque-forming units of VV by either subcutaneous or intrarectal instillation. A dedicated contact sentinel and a bedding sentinel were provided for each index mouse. All 15 index mice were positive for antibodies when tested 22 days after inoculation. One mouse, inoculated by the subcutaneous route, appeared ill and developed lesions on the proximal portion of the tail. The contact sentinel mouse housed with this index mouse was the only sentinel to seroconvert. We conclude that VV-WR can spread to contact sentinels and potentially to bedding sentinels. The ability of other VV strains to be transmitted horizontally and the susceptibility of different mouse strains to infection merit further investigation. The use of VV in animal facilities must be managed carefully since the available serologic tests do not distinguish between VV and EV, an exotic agent of major concern to laboratory animal facilities."	0

"Ectromelia virus (ECTV) is an orthopoxvirus whose natural host is the mouse; it is related closely to Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, and Monkeypox virus, the cause of an emerging zoonosis. The recent sequencing of its genome, along with an effective animal model, makes ECTV an attractive model for the study of poxvirus pathogenesis, antiviral and vaccine testing and viral immune and inflammatory responses. This review discusses the pathogenesis of mousepox, modulation of the immune response by the virus and the cytokine and cellular components of the skin and systemic immune system that are critical to recovery from infection."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	19195492	Effective post-exposure protection against lethal orthopoxviruses infection by vaccinia immune globulin involves induction of adaptive immune response.	"The therapeutic potential of human vaccinia immunoglobulin (VIG) in orthopoxvirus infection was examined using two mouse models for human poxvirus, based on Ectromelia virus and Vaccinia Western Reserve (WR) respiratory infections. Despite the relatively fast clearance of human VIG from mice circulation, a single VIG injection protected immune-competent mice against both infections. Full protection against lethal Ectromelia virus infection was achieved by VIG injection up to one day post-exposure, and even injection of VIG two or three days post-infection conferred solid protection (60-80%). Nevertheless, VIG failed to protect VACV-WR challenged immune-deficient mice, even though repeated injections prolonged SCID mice survival. These results suggest the involvement of host immunity in protection. VIG provides the initial protective time-window allowing induction of the adaptive response required to achieve complete protection. Additionally, VIG can be administered in conjunction with active Vaccinia-Lister vaccination. Vaccine efficiency is not impaired, providing a non-prohibitive VIG dose is used. Thus, VIG can be used as a prophylactic measure against post-vaccinal complications but could also serve for post-exposure treatment against smallpox."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	19807023	[Orthopoxvirus genes for kelch-like proteins. III. Construction of mousepox (ectromelia) virus variants with targeted gene deletions].	"Mousepox (ectromelia) virus genome contains four genes encoding for kelch-like proteins EVM018, EVM027, EVM150 and EVM167. A complete set of insertion plasmids was constructed to allow the production of recombinant ectromelia viruses with targeted deletions of one to four genes of kelch family both individually (single mutants) and in different combinations (double, triple and quadruple mutants). It was shown that deletion of any of the three genes EVMO18, EVM027 or EVM167 resulted in reduction of 50% lethal dose (LD50) by five and more orders in outbred white mice infected intraperitoneally. Deletion of mousepox kelch-gene EVM150 did not influence the virus virulence. Two or more kelch-genes deletion also resulted in high level of attenuation, which could evidently be due to the lack of three genes EVM167, EVM018 and/or EVM027 identified as virulence factors. The local inflammatory process on the model of intradermal injection of mouse ear pinnae (vasodilatation level, hyperemia, cutaneous edema, arterial thrombosis) was significantly more intensive for wild type virus and virulent mutant deltaEVM150 in comparison with avirulent mutant AEVM167."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	ectromelia virus	21994714	Ectromelia virus infections of mice as a model to support the licensure of anti-orthopoxvirus therapeutics.	"The absence of herd immunity to orthopoxviruses and the concern that variola or monkeypox viruses could be used for bioterroristic activities has stimulated the development of therapeutics and safer prophylactics. One major limitation in this process is the lack of accessible human orthopoxvirus infections for clinical efficacy trials; however, drug licensure can be based on orthopoxvirus animal challenge models as described in the \"Animal Efficacy Rule\". One such challenge model uses ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus, whose natural host is the mouse and is the etiological agent of mousepox. The genetic similarity of ectromelia virus to variola and monkeypox viruses, the common features of the resulting disease, and the convenience of the mouse as a laboratory animal underscores its utility in the study of orthopoxvirus pathogenesis and in the development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this review we outline how mousepox has been used as a model for smallpox. We also discuss mousepox in the context of mouse strain, route of infection, infectious dose, disease progression, and recovery from infection."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	164415	Effect of silica on virus infections in mice and mouse tissue culture.	"Silica injections of mice have been reported to kill macrophages, thus allowing herpes simplex virus (HSV) to spread rapidly and leading to an increased severity of HSV infection. Thus, silica presumably could be used to eliminate lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) (a model for slow viruses), which is known to multiply exclusively in macrophages. Contrary to expectation, it was found that the LDV titers were increased in silica-injected mice as compared to the titers in control mice. Counts of peritoneal cells at different periods after silica injection showed that silica-induced macrophage damage in vivo resulted in proliferation and migration of macrophages, thus providing additional target cells for LDV replication and leading to high LDV titers. In vitro, silica ingestion also damaged the macrophages, but since no replacement of cells could occur by infiltration, decreased LDV titers were found. Similar findings were obtained with HSV. It is suggested that all persistent viruses multiplying in macrophages will show a similar recrudescence under comparable conditions."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	558344	Autoradiographic method for detection of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus-infected cells in primary mouse macrophage cultures.	"Peritoneal cells from starch-injected Swiss mice were propagated in plastic petri dishes and on cover slips in a mouse L-cell-conditioned medium for 12 to 24 h and then infected with various multiplicities of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV). Over 95% of the cells in these cultures phagocytosed latex particles and were, therefore, considered macrophages. Infected and mock infected macrophage cultures were supplemented with [3H]uridine at various times after infection and with actinomycin D 30 min before addition of the [3H]uridine. After 1 or 2 h of further incubation, plate cultures were analyzed for LDV-specific RNA, and cover slip cultures were investigated by autoradiography. Other cultures were labeled in the absence of actinomycin D, and the culture fluid was analyzed for labeled LDV. There was a good correlation between the production of LDV-specific RNA and LDV and the number of heavily labeled cells in these cultures. The labeled cells in these cultures. The labeled cells, therefore, were equated with productively infected cells. Only a maximum of about 20% of the macrophages, however, became heavily labeled regardless of the multiplicity of infection or the time, after infection, at which the cells were exposed to [3H]uridine. Only background labeling was observed in the remainder of the cells and in mock-infected cells treated with actinomycin D. The highest proportion of labeled cells was observed when the cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of about 2,000 mouse infectious units per cell and labeled from 6 to 8 h after infection. Thereafter, the proportion of productively infected cells decreased progressively, concomitant with a decrease in the amounts of viral specific RNA and of LDV produced by the cultures. The results indicate that the majority of the macrophages in primary macrophage cultures do not support LDV replication. Their nonpermissiveness may depend on the physiological state of the cells or reflect the presence of subpopulations of macrophages, but no morphological differences between productively infected an uninfected cells were detectable."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	1317890	Macrophage function in the acute phase of lactic dehydrogenase virus-infection of mice: suppression of superoxide anion production in normal mouse peritoneal macrophages by interferon-alpha in vitro.	"The effect of interferon (IFN)-alpha on the release of superoxide anions (O2-) by normal mouse macrophages (PEM) was examined. Sera from LDV-infected mice at 1 day, but not at 7 days post-infection, suppressed the O2- release by PEM. When PEM were exposed in vitro for 24 h to IFN-alpha, their capacity to release O2- was significantly suppressed. Progressive suppression of O2- release with increasing IFN-alpha concentration was observed. These results suggest that IFN-alpha in the circulation may be one of several suppressive factors on macrophage function in the early phase of infection and IFN-alpha may play a modulatory role in inflammation and immunity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	1416911	Virucidal effect of murine duodenal extracts: studies with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.	"Mucosal resistance to infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) has been previously demonstrated, and the LDV system presents an important murine model for the study of mucosal barriers to viral infection. In the present study, duodenal molecules were isolated from normal mice which had potent virucidal activity, when tested against LDV as well as canine herpes, canine hepatitis, Semliki forest, and visna viruses. The virucidal activity was demonstrated to be non-immune in nature, and was present in apparently non-enzymatic protein molecules, having a molecular mass of between 10-100 kDa by membrane filtration and 10-17 kDa by gel filtration. The anti-LDV activity of these molecules was suppressed by anti-duodenum antibodies in vitro, and in vivo studies suggested a possible protective role for the anti-viral molecules. We conclude that the normal mouse duodenum contains potent virucidal molecules, which are of interest to the study of biological and molecular mechanisms of viral resistance."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	1419776	Binding of asparaginase to mouse monocytes.	"We have demonstrated that biotinylated asparaginase binds to mouse monocytes. Also, asparaginase bound to peritoneal exudate, resident, splenic, bone marrow and pulmonary macrophages, but not to neutrophils or lymphocytes. Labelled asparaginase binding to peritoneal exudate macrophages was inhibited by 20-fold excess of unlabelled asparaginase. The binding of asparaginase to monocytes from mice injected with lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV) or carrageenan was decreased. This decreased binding following treatment with LDV or carrageenan was reversed when mice were treated with diethylstilboestrol. In-vivo asparaginase clearance in mice infected with LDV was impaired as compared with that in uninfected mice. Neither strain nor age differences affected the binding to monocytes. The results suggest that the ability of asparaginase to bind to monocytes in vitro may reflect clearance function in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	1610489	Immune complexes that bind to ELISA plates not coated with antigen in mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus: relationship to IgG2a- and IgG2b-specific polyclonal activation of B cells.	"We have further investigated the nature of IgG-containing complexes of 150-300 kD that rapidly appear in the circulation of mice of various strains after infection with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and are recognized and quantitated by their binding in the presence of 0.05% Tween 20 to certain enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates with high protein affinity that have not been coated with protein antigen (5). These binding complexes have been found to contain primarily IgG2a or, in some mice, IgG2b. Their isotype specificity and time course of formation correlated with those of the polyclonal production of immunoglobulins in these mice, as measured by increases in total IgG2a or IgG2b in the circulation. In contrast, anti-LDV antibodies exhibited much broader isotype specificities in all mouse strains investigated. Depletion of BALB/c mice of CD4+T cells or lack of T cells in nude Swiss mice only partly reduced the polyclonal activation of B cells and the formation of ELISA plate-binding complexes, whereas anti-LDV antibody formation was completely blocked. Only a small proportion of the total IgG2a or IgG2b formed as a result of the LDV-induced polyclonal activation of B cells was recovered in plate-binding complexes, which sedimented in sucrose density gradients between 150 and 300 kD. Diverse monoclonal antibodies of different IgG isotopes did not bind to the plates at concentrations at which LDV-induced immune complexes exhibited binding activity. We suggest that the LDV-induced immune complexes do not contain anti-LDV antibodies, but are complexes of auto-antibodies and self-antigen(s). However, additional features must be responsible for the high affinity of these complexes for ELISA plates since various immune complexes formed in vitro failed to bind to the plates, and binding activity of the immune complexes formed in LDV-infected mice could not be regenerated in vitro once the complexes had been dissociated by a low pH treatment."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	2076177	Polyclonal B cell activation of IgG2a and IgG2b production by infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus is partly dependent on CD4+ lymphocytes.	"Concentrations of IgM and IgG isotypes were determined by capture ELISA in plasma of Swiss, BALB/c and C58/M mice. Plasma IgG isotype concentrations, especially of IgM, IgG1 and IgG2a, varied considerably between mouse strains, batches of mice of the same strain and individual mice and as a function of age. Infection of the mice with LDV, which is known to replicate primarily in a subpopulation of macrophages, consistently resulted in a rapid elevation of plasma IgG2a (or of IgG2b in some Swiss nu/+ mice), but no plasma IgG increases were observed in mice immunized with inactivated LDV. Plasma IgG2a elevation after LDV infection was greatly delayed and reduced by depletion of the mice of CD4+, but not of CD8+, T cells by administration of protein-G-purified anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 mAbs, and completely inhibited by repeated treatment of the mice with cyclophosphamide. Treatment with anti-CD4 mAbs, or cyclophosphamide also greatly reduced the production of anti-LDV antibodies, while not significantly affecting the replication of LDV in these mice. Nude Swiss mice also failed to produce anti-LDV antibodies, though supporting normal LDV replication. Plasma IgM, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b levels increased in LDV-infected nu/nu mice, but similar changes were observed in uninfected mice. The results indicate that the LDV-induced polyclonal activation of B cells requires productive LDV infection of mice and is, at least partly, dependent on functioning CD4+ cells. They suggest that productive infection of the LDV-permissive subpopulation of macrophages leads to the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes of subset 1 and their Spleen cells from 5-day LDV-infected BALB/c mice incorporated [3H]thymidine 2-3 times more rapidly in vitro than spleen cells from companion uninfected mice, whereas their responses to concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide were reduced 60-70%."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	2623944	Persistent infection of mice by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus: effects of immunosuppression on virus replication and antiviral immune responses.	"Maximum plasma titers (10(9)-10(10) ID50/ml) of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) in mice are observed one day after infection, but then decrease 4-5 log during the next 5 weeks to attain a persistent steady-state level for the remainder of the life of the animal. The decrease in plasma LDV level during the first 5 weeks after infection and long-term viremia were not affected by lethal X-irradiation of the mice, daily injections of cyclosporin A or depletion of the mice of T cells by treatment with anti-CD4, anti-CD8, or anti-Thy1.2 monoclonal antibodies, although these treatments inhibited the formation of anti-LDV antibodies. LDV viremia was also the same in nu/nu and nu/+ Swiss mice, though the former did not mount an anti-LDV immune response, while the latter did. The appearance of anti-LDV neutralizing antibodies in infected mice 1-2 months after infection or the injection of infected mice with high doses of anti-LDV neutralizing monoclonal antibodies also did not affect the level of LDV viremia. Repeated treatments of infected mice with either cyclophosphamide or dexamethasone caused 1-2 log increases in plasma LDV titers. Although cyclophosphamide treatment prevented the formation of anti-LDV antibodies, dexamethasone caused an increase in plasma LDV levels without affecting anti-LDV antibody formation. We conclude that an anti-LDV immune response does not play a significant role in controlling LDV replication in mice. The data support the view that within 1 day after infection of a mouse, all LDV-permissive macrophages, which appear to be the only cells supporting LDV replication in the mouse, are destroyed as a result of a cytocidal infection by LDV. Subsequently, LDV replication is limited by the rate of generation of new permissive macrophages. The steady-state viremia attained about 5 weeks after infection reflects a balance between LDV replication in permissive macrophages as they arise and LDV inactivation and clearance."	0

"At present there is incomplete knowledge concerning the relationship of route of infection to minimum infectious dose (MID) for viruses of humans or other animals. The present work has used lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) as a mouse model for this relationship. The data establish a relative mucosal barrier to LDV transmission, which is more effective at oral, ocular and vaginal sites, than at the rectal site of inoculation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	4318951	Intrinsic interference: a new type of viral interference.	"The hemadsorption-negative plaque test has revealed a new type of viral interference, termed intrinsic interference. Several unrelated types of noncytopathic viruses were shown to induce in infected host cells a state of interference unique in being directed solely against superinfection by Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The NDV-refractory state arises only in those individual cells of a population actually infected by the inducing virus, and presumably results from the action of a protein(s) coded for by the viral genome. Thus, intrinsic interference differs fundamentally from that mediated by an extrinsic protein detectable under conditions favoring resistance to a broad spectrum of viruses and characteristic of interference induced by interferon, the latter being coded for by the cell genome. Intrinsic interference is defined as a viral genome-induced cellular state of resistance to challenge by high multiplicities of NDV, coexistent with a state of susceptibility to a broad spectrum of other viruses, similarly tested at high multiplicities. The capacity to induce intrinsic interference was demonstrated with rubella virus, Sindbis virus (arbovirus, group A), West Nile virus (arbovirus, group B), poliovirus (MEF, type 2), the lactic dehydrogenase virus (Riley's agent), and an unidentified nonhemadsorbing, noncytopathic adventitious virus. A state of intrinsic interference was also observed in the V5 line of mouse cells carrying a murine leukemia virus, probably resulting from some heretofore unsuspected contaminating virus. The molecular basis for intrinsic interference is not known, but it appears to involve a step in the NDV growth cycle beyond that of viral attachment, entry, and eclipse."	0

"A Sepharose-IgG-Clq sorbent has been successfully used to isolate circulating virus-antibody (virus Ab) complexes from serum of lactic dehydrogenase virus (LDV)-infected mice. The chronological study demonstrated that although circulating LDV in persistently infected mice was complexed with IgG antibody, the virus-Ab complexes bound to the Clq sorbent only early during the infection. Inactivation of these Clq-isolated virus Ab complexes was accomplished with rabbit anti-mouse IgG but not anti-IgM. The critical time period for the demonstration of Clq-binding LDV-Ab complexes in serum was between 10 and 18 days postinoculation. The reasons for the apparent shift from Clq-binding virus-Ab complexes to non-Clq binding are not clear, however, possible explanations and implications in immune complex tissue injury are discussed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	7637013	Cytotoxic T cells are elicited during acute infection of mice with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus but disappear during the chronic phase of infection.	"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) invariably establishes a life-long viremic infection in mice, which is maintained by replication of LDV in a renewable subpopulation of macrophages and escape from all host immune responses. We now demonstrate that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) that specifically lyse LDV-infected macrophages and 3T3 cells producing the nucleocapsid protein of LDV were elicited in Swiss, B10.A, and (Swiss x B10.A)F1 mice. To detect target cell lysis, splenocytes needed to be expanded by a 5-day in vitro culture in the presence of recombinant interleukin 2 and syngeneic LDV protein-expressing cells. In vitro culture resulted in the specific expansion of CD8+ cells which mediated the lysis of target cells in a major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted manner. When CTLs were added to macrophage cultures at 1 h after infection with LDV, the lysis of the infected macrophages by the CTLs started about 5 h postinfection (p.i.) and, at an effector cell/target cell ratio of 25:1, resulted in the lysis of all LDV-infected macrophages in a culture by about 7 h p.i. However, lysis of the LDV replication in a culture was not rapid enough to significantly suppress the LDV yield in the culture. LDV replication in mice was also little affected by the presence of CTLs which were induced by immunization with 3T3 cells expressing the LDV nucleocapsid protein. Furthermore, all CTL precursor cells in infected mice had disappeared by 30 days p.i. Loss of CTL precursor cells in infected mice probably reflected high-dose clonal exhaustion, since LDV infection of a mouse results in massive production of LDV in all tissues of the mouse, but especially in lymphoidal tissues, and accumulation of LDV in newly formed germinal centers. Furthermore, slow LDV replication continues in the thymus and other lymphoidal organs."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	9372459	Involvement of CD4+ cells in the protection of C58 mouse against polioencephalomyelitis induced by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.	"Immunosuppression, occurring naturally with aging, or experimentally after cyclophosphamide treatment or irradiation, is required for the development in C58 mice infected with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of a severe polioencephalomyelitis that is caused by viral destruction of anterior horn neurons. Here it is shown that depletion of T helper lymphocytes by administration of an anti-CD4 antibody was followed by a progressive paralysis typical of polioencephalomyelitis in C58/J mice inoculated with a neurovirulent strain of LDV. Although it was clear that other cell subsets are also required to assure complete protection of genetically-susceptible mice, our results show that T helper lymphocytes play a major role in the prevention of LDV-induced polioencephalomyelitis. The mechanisms by which these cells confer this protection remain however to be determined."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	11526099	Distinct requirements for IL-6 in polyclonal and specific Ig production induced by microorganisms.	"The role of IL-6 in Ig production induced in the mouse by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV), Toxoplasma gondii or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was assessed. Following infection with LDV, a strong activator of B cells, an early and transient IL-6 production was observed, that originated predominantly from macrophages. Whereas LDV-induced B lymphocyte proliferation appeared independent of IL-6, mice deficient for this cytokine showed a marked reduction in their total T-dependent IgG2a production when compared to their normal counterparts. By contrast, specific responses directed against either LDV or non-viral antigens administered at the time of infection were not decreased in the absence of IL-6. Similarly, polyclonal, but not anti-parasite IgG2a production triggered by T. gondii infection was strongly dependent on the presence of IL-6. Finally, T-independent total IgG3 secretion triggered by LPS was also markedly reduced in IL-6-deficient mice. These results suggest that IL-6 plays a major role in T-dependent and T-independent polyclonal Ig production following B lymphocyte activation by viruses, and parasites, but not in specific antibody responses induced by the same microorganisms."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	gammaarterivirus lacdeh	21354210	Removal of lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus from human-in-mouse breast tumor xenografts by cell-sorting.	"Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) can infect transplantable mouse tumors or xenograft tumors in mice through LDV-contaminated mouse biological materials, such as Matrigel, or through mice infected with LDV. LDV infects specifically mouse macrophages and alters immune system and tumor phenotype. The traditional approaches to remove LDV from tumor cells, by transplanting tumors into rats or culturing tumor cells in vitro, are inefficient, labor-intensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, these approaches are not feasible for primary tumor cells that cannot survive tissue culture conditions or that may change phenotype in rats. This study reports that fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is a simple and efficient approach for purifying living primary human breast tumor cells from LDV(+) mouse stromal cells, which can be completed in a few hours. When purified from Matrigel contaminated LDV(+) tumors, sorted human breast tumor cells, as well as tumors grown from sorted cells, were shown to be LDV-free, as tested by PCR. The results demonstrate that cell sorting is effective, much faster and less likely to alter tumor cell phenotype than traditional methods for removing LDV from xenograft models. This approach may also be used to remove other rodent-specific viruses from models derived from distinct tissues or species with sortable markers, where virus does not replicate in the cells to be purified."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	7783676	Characterization of the mode of Hantaan virus infection in adult mice using a nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction: transient virus replication in adult mice.	"A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of hantavirus genome was established and applied to analyze the mode of infection of Hantaan virus in adult ICR mice. The cDNA for the S genome segment of Hantaan virus was reverse-transcribed from the total RNA of organs of the infected mice. The sequence in the S genome segment of Hantaan virus was successfully amplified by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR followed by nested PCR. In 5-week-old ICR mice inoculated intraperitoneally with Hantaan virus, strain 76-118 (1.3 x 10(5) FFU/mouse), the virus was detected in clots and lungs from 3 to 10 days post-inoculation (p.i.) by nested PCR and virus-isolation techniques. No virus was detected in any specimens collected on 1 day and after 28 days p.i., and in spleens and brains through the observation period by both methods. The antibody which was measured by indirect immunofluorescence antibody assay (IFA) appeared at 7 days p.i. and the geometric mean titer was elevated to its maximum level of 1:203 at 10 days p.i., maintaining the same level until 35 days p.i. These results suggest that adult mice are transiently infected with Hantaan virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	8585284	Effect of MDP-Lys(L18), a derivative of MDP, on enhancing host resistance against Hantaan virus infection in newborn mice.	"We examined the effect of MDP-Lys(L18), a lipophilic derivative of muramyl dipeptide, on the enhancement of host resistance against virus infection in newborn mice. Newborn mice were inoculated with 4 LD50/mouse of Hantaan virus strain 76-118 (HTN) one day after birth. Mice given 100 micrograms/mouse of MDP-Lys(L18) before infection exhibited significantly higher survival rates than those of non-treated mice. The effect of MDP-Lys(L18) was also restorative when given to the mice 4 or 7 days after infection. The titers of virus isolated from the lungs and spleens 12 days after infection, were about 30-times lower in MDP-Lys(L18)-treated (lung: 1.0 x 10(3) FFU; spleen: 6.8 x 10(1) FFU/mouse), than those of non-treated mice (lung: 3.4 x 10(4) FFU; spleen: 1.9 x 10(3) FFU/mouse). Furthermore, the virus was undetectable in the brains of MDP-Lys(L18)-treated mice, whereas viruses were isolated from 3 of 6 non-treated mice. MDP-Lys(L18) augmented the number of peripheral leukocytes and splenocytes, as well as mitogenic responses of the cells from bone marrow and spleen of newborn mice. These results suggest that MDP-Lys(L18) enhanced the resistance of newborn mice against HTN virus in a systemic infection model, and that this mechanism is involved in the enhancement of hematopoiesis and responsiveness of immune-related cells to mitogens."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	12163608	Hantaan virus infection causes an acute neurological disease that is fatal in adult laboratory mice.	"Hantaan virus, the etiological agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever, is transmitted to humans from persistently infected mice (Apodemus agrarius), which serve as the primary reservoir. Here we demonstrate that several strains of adult Mus musculus domesticus (C57BL/6, BALB/c, AKR/J, and SJL/J) were susceptible to Hantaan virus infection when infected intraperitoneally. First clinical signs were loss of weight, ruffled fur, and reduced activity, which were followed by neurological symptoms, such as paralyses and convulsions. Within 2 days of disease onset, the animals died of acute encephalitis. PCR analysis indicated a systemic infection with viral RNA present in all major organs. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses of postmortem material detected viral antigen and RNA in the central nervous system (predominantly brain), liver, and spleen. In the central nervous system, viral antigen and RNA colocalized with perivascular infiltrations, the predominant pathological finding. To investigate the involvement of the interferon system in Hantaan virus pathogenesis, we infected alpha/beta interferon receptor knockout mice. These animals were more susceptible to Hantaan virus infection, indicating an important role of interferon-induced antiviral defense mechanisms in Hantaan virus pathogenesis. The present model may help to overcome shortcomings in the development of therapeutic and prophylactic measurements against hantavirus infections."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	12706671	Inactivated Hantaan virus vaccine derived from suspension culture of Vero cells.	"We have developed a cell culture-derived, inactivated vaccine against Hantaan virus for prevention of the hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Hantaan virus was purified from a microcarrier culture of Vero E6 cells by ultrafiltration and density gradient centrifugation. Viral infection was inactivated by treatment of the viral stock with formaldehyde. Immunogenic properties of the vaccine were characterized in comparison with Hantavax, a mouse brain-derived, formalin-inactivated vaccine that has been in human use for a decade in Korea. Compared to the Hantavax, immunization of Balb/c mice with the cell culture-based vaccine resulted in a moderate difference in antibody response to the viral nucleocapsid protein but more than five-fold increase in neutralizing activity. Moreover, all six mice immunized with 5 microg of the cell culture-based vaccine were fully protected from challenge with infectious virus, whereas virus was detected in lung and spleen of all animals immunized with the same dose of Hantavax. Four times higher dose of the latter vaccine was needed for complete protection. In the analysis of the humoral immune response to the vaccines, we found that all three viral structural proteins, N, G1 and G2 were immunoprecipitated by sera from animals immunized with the cell culture-based vaccine. In contrast, N and some G1 but no G2 were precipitated by the sera from animals immunized with Hantavax. These results suggest that the cell culture-based vaccine can provide more effective immunity than the Hantavax."	0

"To investigate whether Leptotrombidium scutellare could be naturally infected by both Hantaan virus (HV) and Orientia tsutsugamushi (OT) and transmission status by stinging., 3459 Leptotrombidium scutellares from mice bodies and 3265 which were free were collected in the epidemic area of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and tsutsugamushi disease.15 days later, the suspensions of lung and spleen of mice with 6 in a group stung by 1, 5 or 10 infected mites were injected intra-cerebrally into other mice for the detection of HV and OT in the next 6 generations of the mice, with immunofluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) and Giemsa staining technique. The passages of Vero-E6 cells inoculated on the aseptic filtrations from different number of infected mites were used to detect HV and OT pathogens. HV-RNA and OT-DNA were detected by PCR., After passage, HV positive mouse body mite group out of both 5 and 10 mites in the sixth generation, OT positive mouse body mite group out of the 10 mites in the sixth generation, both HV and OT positive mouse body mite group out of 1 mite in the fifth and sixth generation, both HV and OT positive mouse body mite group out of 5 and 10 mites in the sixth generation, and free mites group out of 1, 5 and 10 mites in the sixth generation, were found one mouse infected by both HV and OT, respectively. Out of the fourth generation of Vero-E6 cells, one sample was found both HV and OT positive out of 5 and 10 HV and OT mouse body mite group, respectively. In the sixth generation, both HV and OT positive cells were detected in one mouse mite group and the 1, 5, 10 free mite groups, respectively. HV-RNA and OT-DNA were all detected by PCR., Both HV and OT could be coexisted in wild Leptotrombidium scutellare and transmitted by stinging."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	2103102	Comparison of the replication of distinct strains of human coronavirus OC43 in organotypic human colon cells (Caco-2) and mouse intestine.	"Three strains of human coronavirus (HCV) OC43 were compared for their ability to cause enteric infections and to induce interferon alpha (IFN alpha) using the Caco-2 human colon carcinoma cell line which exhibits spontaneous epithelial differentiation in vitro. MRC-5 cell culture grown stocks were prepared from: 1. CV Paris, a strain of OC43 recovered from an outbreak of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns. 2. CV Mb, a neurotropic strain of OC43 which exhibits strict neuronal specificity in murine neuronal cell cultures. 3. CV Rd, a strain of OC43 which grows to a high titer in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells. Immunofluorescent staining for nucleocapsid antigen and plaque assay in MRC-5 cells was used to detect viral replication. BG-9 (human foreskin) cells challenged with vesicular stomatitis virus were used to detect IFN alpha production by human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) stimulated by virus infected Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 yielded 10(4.6) and 10(4.4) plaque forming units/ml (pfu/ml) with CV Rd and CV Paris respectively, while CV Mb yielded only 10(3) pfu/ml. Caco-2 cells infected with CV Rd induced 64 IU/ml of IFN alpha in PBMC while these cells infected with CV Paris induced less than 2 IU/ml IFN alpha. In cells infected with CV Mb 4 IU/ml IFN alpha was detected. The results suggest that a lack of IFN alpha induction by CV Paris may be an indicator of its enteropathogenic potential.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	2170746	Susceptibility of laboratory mice to intranasal and contact infection with coronaviruses of other species.	"The susceptibility of laboratory mice to intranasal and contact infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-related coronaviruses was tested in infant CD1 mice. One day old mouse pups were inoculated intranasally with respiratory MHV-S, enteric MHV-Y, rat sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCV-OC43) or bovine coronavirus (BCV). Twenty-four hours later, they were placed in direct contact with age matched sham inoculated pups. Indices of infection in virus inoculated mice included lesions by histopathology and viral antigen by immunoperoxidase histochemistry in brain, lung, liver and intestine at 3 days after inoculation. Indices of infection in contact mice included mortality or seroconversion by 21 days after exposure. Infant mice were susceptible to infection with all five viruses. Transmission by direct contact exposure occurred with MHV and SDAV, but not HCV or BCV. Furthermore, adult mice were not susceptible to infection with HCV. Tissue distribution of lesions and antigen varied markedly among viruses, indicating that they do not induce the same disease as MHV. This study demonstrates that although these coronaviruses are antigenically closely related, they are biologically different viruses and disease patterns in susceptible infant mice can be used to differentiate viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	6687965	Coronaviruses SD and SK share extensive nucleotide homology with murine coronavirus MHV-A59, more than that shared between human and murine coronaviruses.	"A cDNA probe representing the genome of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 (MHV-A59) was used to measure nucleotide sequence homologies among murine and human coronaviruses and the SD and SK coronaviruses isolated by Burks et al. Since SD and SK were isolated by inoculation of multiple sclerosis (MS) central nervous system (CNS) tissue into mice or cultured mouse cells, it is important to determine their relationships to other murine and human coronavirus isolates. Our results indicate that SD and SK share almost complete nucleotide homology (approximately 90%) with MHV-A59 and generate subgenomic RNAs of the same sizes as MHV-A59. The human coronavirus (HCV) strains tested show less homology with MHV-A59. The immunologically unrelated HCV-229E shows no nucleotide homology with MHV-A59. The immunologically cross-reactive HCV-OC43 shows nucleotide homology with MHV-A59 by blot hybridization but not when hybridized in solution and assayed by S1 nuclease digestion."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	8678840	Inactivation of hepatitis C virus cDNA transgene by hypermethylation in transgenic mice.	"Transgenic mice were produced by microinjection of a partial hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome sequence including the structural protein region, under the control of the albumin promoter and enhancer into fertilized eggs of C57BL/6 and BDF1 mice. Three founders carrying at least five copies of the transgene but not expressing HCV-specific RNA were generated. Methylation analysis indicated that the transgene was extensively methylated. Mapping of methylated cytosine residues of the transgenic mouse DNA showed that all C residues of a particular part of the HCV genome but not all the CpG island like sequences were methylated. Transiently expressed HCV cDNA in COS7 cells and the active endogenous albumin gene were not methylated. Furthermore, 5-azacytidine, a potent demethylating agent, induced HCV gene expression in a line of these transgenic mice. These results suggest that methylation of HCV cDNA is a cause of its inactive expression in transgenic mice, and that this phenomenon may occur in other stable systems for expression of the HCV genome."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	9021964	A specific antibody response to HCV E2 elicited in mice by intramuscular inoculation of plasmid DNA containing coding sequences for E2.	"As the chimpanzee, the only reliable animal model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, is impractical for early stage testing of HCV vaccine candidates, we have evaluated the immune response in mice to an experimental plasmid based HCV vaccine. We used this system because DNA vaccines can be rapidly constructed without the necessity of large scale protein production and purification. In this preliminary study we tested the immune response in mice to HCV envelope glycoprotein, E2, induced by a eukaryotic expression plasmid. Protein expression was monitored by immunofluorescence in transfected tissue culture cells. Each mouse was inoculated intramuscular with 100 microg plasmid DNA and some mice were boosted after 5 weeks. Among 12 BALB/C mice inoculated, 10 developed antibody to E2 by the second week. The antibody levels increased steadily before reaching a plateau in mice receiving the booster, but in the nonboosted mice the antibody declined over time. The serum from one mouse was tested against a series of overlapping peptides covering most of E2. This serum contained antibodies recognizing two distinct epitopes beginning at amino acid 57 and amino acid 113 but no antibody was directed against peptides representing the hypervariable region of E2, antibody to which is thought to be important in HCV neutralization. We have shown that the use of plasmid based vaccines can induce a specific immune response in mice against HCV antigens. This system should be useful as the first step in vaccine development."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	9049225	Hepatitis C virus core and E2 protein expression in transgenic mice.	"Transgenic mice have been produced that express the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein in the liver under the transcriptional control of the mouse major urinary protein promoter. These animals express the full length core protein in cytoplasm of their hepatocytes at levels comparable to those detected in naturally infected patients, without histological or biochemical evidence of liver disease or hepatocellular carcinoma. This contrasts with recent reports that HCV core protein can transform NIH 3T3 cells and cooperates with H-ras to transform primary rat fibroblasts in vitro. Coexpression of HCV core protein in double transgenic mice that replicate the hepatitis B virus (HBV) does not inhibit hepatocellular HBV gene expression or replication, contrary to reports that it inhibits HBV replication in HuH-7 cells after transient transfection in vitro. We have also produced transgenic mice in which a C-terminally truncated (aa384-715) glycosylated HCV E2 protein is expressed in the liver under the transcriptional control of the mouse albumin promoter. Despite the high level expression of HCV E2 protein, no evidence of liver disease was detected in these animals. These results suggest that the HCV core and E2 proteins are not cytopathic for the hepatocyte in vivo, and they represent an initial step in the development of a small animal model of HCV immunopathology."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	9225025	Hepatitis C virus core protein induces hepatic steatosis in transgenic mice.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis worldwide, which finally leads to development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic hepatitis C is characterized by several histological features in the liver which discriminate it from other forms of hepatitis: bile duct damage, lymphoid follicles and steatosis (fatty change). Little is known, however, about the role of HCV or its viral proteins in the pathogenesis of hepatitis. Recently, the core protein of HCV has been suggested to have a transcriptional regulatory function, and thereby to be involved in inducing phenotypic changes in hepatocytes. To clarify whether or not the HCV core protein has an effect on pathological phenotypes in the liver, two independent transgenic mouse lines carrying the HCV core gene were established. These mice developed progressive hepatic steatosis, indicating that the HCV core protein plays a direct role in the development of hepatic steatosis, which characterizes hepatitis C. This transgenic mouse system would be a good animal model for the study of pathogenesis in human HCV infection."	0

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) circulating in patient's blood acquired cytopathogenic properties after infection of suckling mouse brain cells. HCV infection of PS cells was studied for 11 months. Three stages of infection were distinguished; noncytocidal infection, poorly manifest destruction of PS cells, and intensive cytodestruction and cell repopulation. Persistent HCV was steadily released in PS culture and caused destruction of BHK-21, Vero, PS, HAK, and chick embryo cells. Infective titers of HCV in culture fluid collected from these cultures were 10.0 = 11.0 lg TCD50/0.2 ml. Cytopathogenic activity of HCV regularly confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction was neutralized by anti-HCV-positive sera of patients with hepatitis C. Persistent HCV formed heterogeneous plaques in chick embryo fibroblast cultures and agglutinated goose erythrocytes. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated that 25 to 45% of infected cells contained virus-specific antigens. The PS-HCV system holds the best promise for theoretical and practical studies of hepatitis C."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	9554270	Nucleic acid vaccines against hepatitis viruses.	"Direct DNA intramuscular or intradermal injection of plasmids containing viral genes under the control of viral promoters is an efficient means of stimulating both class I and class II-mediated antiviral responses. Viral hepatitis B and C are suitable candidates for this approach, particularly as therapeutic immunogens for chronically infected individuals. Several groups have shown that the S gene of HBV is expressed in murine muscle and stimulates a high titre and long-lasting anti-HBs response. Uniquely, CD8+ CTL responses are also induced to HBsAg. No vaccine exists for HCV. Therefore the structural genes (C + E1 + E2) have been cloned as a 2,831 bp fragment from a genotype la isolate into the vector pcDNA3. The resulting plasmid DNA was injected directly into the quadriceps muscle of three-week-old BALB/c mice. Intracellular-expressed E1 and E2 proteins thus represent the complete spectrum of native structural epitopes, including those dependent on glycosylation and protein folding. Mouse antisera were tested for reactivity against conserved sequences using overlapping 7-mer peptides. Two conserved, overlapping epitopes were identified in E2 spanning residues 581-591 and 590-603. This domain represents one of seven major E2 antigenic domains recognized by HCV human antibodies, one of three with antigenic homologies to related flavivirus proteins. Thus antigen is presented with high efficiency following DNA injection and offers the potential of high rates of seroconversion and virus clearance in those predisposed to virus-induced chronic liver disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	9657114	Hepatitis C virus persistence in human hematopoietic cells injected into SCID mice.	"The issue of infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has potentially important implications, but is still debated. We have used the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model to test for the persistence of HCV in PBMC. Hematopoietic cells isolated from 14 subjects infected by HCV were inoculated intraperitoneally into SCID mice. Serum and blood cell samples from these mice were obtained with a mean follow-up of 8 weeks. As controls, human fibroblasts and sheep PBMC, preincubated with a human HCV-positive serum, were inoculated concomitantly into mice and analyzed. HCV-RNA positive strands were detected in 7 of 26 serum samples and 8 of 26 cell fractions from SCID mice inoculated with HCV-positive PBMC, after 8 weeks of follow-up. In contrast, no HCV RNA was detectable in the 10 control mice. HCV-RNA negative strands were detected in only 2 of 10 tested samples from 2 mice, and both positive mice had been inoculated with PBMC from HCV-positive subjects with malignant hematopoietic syndrome. Our study offers strong evidence for the persistence of HCV infection in mononuclear cells. Our results are also consistent with a low rate of HCV multiplication. This SCID mouse model might therefore be useful in analyzing the mechanisms of HCV persistence in mononuclear cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	10336476	Hepatitis C virus core protein binds to a DEAD box RNA helicase.	"Approximately 4 million Americans are infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), making it a major cause of chronic liver disease. Because of the lack of an efficient cell culture system, little is known about the interaction between HCV and host cells. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a human liver cell cDNA library with HCV core protein as bait and isolated the DEAD box protein DBX. DBX has significant amino acid sequence identity to mouse PL10, an ATP-dependent RNA helicase. The binding of DBX to HCV core protein occurred in an in vitro binding assay in the presence of 1 M NaCl or detergent. When expressed in mammalian cells, HCV core protein and DBX were co-localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. In a mutant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DBX complemented the function of Ded1p, an essential DEAD box RNA helicase. HCV core protein inhibited the growth of DBX-complemented mutant yeast but not Ded1p-expressing yeast. HCV core protein also inhibited the in vitro translation of capped but not uncapped RNA. These findings demonstrate an interaction between HCV core protein and a host cell protein involved in RNA translation and suggest a mechanism by which HCV may inhibit host cell mRNA translation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	10502257	Hepatitis C virus structural proteins induce liver cell injury in transgenic mice.	"To develop an animal model of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, transgenic mice carrying part of the HCV cDNA (C980) encoding HCV-core and envelope proteins under control of the mouse class I major histocompatibility complex gene (H-2K) regulatory region were produced. HCV-C980 RNA and HCV-core protein were present in livers from line H36 as determined by RNase protection assay and immunostaining, respectively. More than 40 animals from line H36 were examined histologically. Most of these H36 mice after 10 months of age developed spontaneous focal infiltration of lymphocytes, hepatocyte necrosis, degeneration, and altered foci with mitotic hepatocytes. These pathological lesions were absent in livers from the age-matched control littermates. Liver cells from these H36 mice were sensitive to damage induced by intravenous administration of an anti-Fas antibody. It is suggested that HCV-C980 proteins by themselves may be one causative agent of liver cell injury in subjects with HCV infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	11024134	Characterization of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HCV E2 interactions with CD81 and the low-density lipoprotein receptor.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) or HCV-low-density lipoprotein (LDL) complexes interact with the LDL receptor (LDLr) and the HCV envelope glycoprotein E2 interacts with CD81 in vitro. However, E2 interactions with LDLr and HCV interactions with CD81 have not been clearly described. Using sucrose gradient-purified low-density particles (1.03 to 1.07 g/cm(3)), intermediate-density particles (1. 12 to 1.18 g/cm(3)), recombinant E2 protein, or control proteins, we assessed binding to MOLT-4 cells, foreskin fibroblasts, or LDLr-deficient foreskin fibroblasts at 4 degrees C by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Viral entry was determined by measuring the coentry of alpha-sarcin, a protein synthesis inhibitor. We found that low-density HCV particles, but not intermediate-density HCV or controls bound to MOLT-4 cells and fibroblasts expressing the LDLr. Binding correlated with the extent of cellular LDLr expression and was inhibited by LDL but not by soluble CD81. In contrast, E2 binding was independent of LDLr expression and was inhibited by human soluble CD81 but not mouse soluble CD81 or LDL. Based on confocal microscopy, we found that low-density HCV particles and LDL colocalized on the cell surface. The addition of low-density HCV but not intermediate-density HCV particles to MOLT-4 cells allowed coentry of alpha-sarcin, indicating viral entry. The amount of viral entry also correlated with LDLr expression and was independent of the CD81 expression. Using a solid-phase immunoassay, recombinant E2 protein did not interact with LDL. Our data indicate that E2 binds CD81; however, virus particles utilize LDLr for binding and entry. The specific mechanism by which HCV particles interact with LDL or the LDLr remains unclear."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	11055240	Possible role of cytotoxic T cells in acute liver injury in hepatitis C virus cDNA transgenic mice mediated by Cre/loxP system.	"A line of hepatitis C virus (HCV) transgenic mice was established previously that was mediated by Cre/loxP system using HCV cDNA, including core, E1, E2 and NS2 genes. Intravenous infection of a recombinant adenovirus that expresses Cre DNA recombinase (AxCANCre) induced HCV structural protein expression in the liver of transgenic mice. HCV core protein production and transgene recombination in the mouse liver were serially evaluated after AxCANCre infusion. Core proteins were expressed efficiently and transgene was almost completely recombined in the liver of mice after 3 days and then the levels of both core protein production and transgene recombination decreased continuously for 28 days. However, 30.6% of the transgene recombination remained at 28 days and only 2.7% of core production remained at 28 days after infection. Compared with nontransgenic controls, the serum alanine aminotransferase levels in transgenic mice were significantly higher 10, 14, and 21 days after adenovirus infection. Histological scoring also indicated severe pathological changes in the liver of transgenic mice after adenovirus infection. AxCANCre infusion increased CD8+ lymphocyte infiltration into the liver of transgenic mice compared with that of non-transgenic controls. Furthermore, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) isolated from transgenic mice during liver injury were specific for the HCV proteins. These results suggest that HCV structural proteins expressed in the liver of transgenic mice enhanced liver injury. HCV-specific CTLs may be to enhance hepatitis. Thus, the present HCV transgenic mouse model provides a useful model of liver injury due to HCV, and the host immune response may play a pivotal role(s) in the pathogenesis of HCV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	11124832	Hepatitis C virus core protein enhances the activation of the transcription factor, Elk1, in response to mitogenic stimuli.	"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways play key roles in cell proliferation, transformation of mammalian cells, and the stress response. We and other investigators showed that hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has an oncogenic potential, but its mechanism has remained unknown. We previously demonstrated that the MAPK-extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)-ERK pathway and its downstream target, the serum response element (SRE), is activated in BALB/3T3 cells producing HCV core protein. To elucidate the precise mechanism by which HCV core protein activates the MEK-ERK pathway, we transiently expressed HCV core protein in several cell lines and studied the signal transduction of the pathway, using Gal4-Elk1 luciferase assay, in vitro kinas assay of MAPK, and Western blotting analysis. We discovered that, in the presence of mitogenic signal, HCV core protein enhanced Elk1 activation working downstream of MEK without affecting ERK activity and Elk1 phosphorylation. Our data suggest that HCV core protein may activate Elk1 through a pathway alternative to the typical phosphorylation cascade. These findings might give new insights into the role of HCV in hepatocarcinogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	11336543	Hepatitis C virus core protein enhances FADD-mediated apoptosis and suppresses TRADD signaling of tumor necrosis factor receptor.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein has been shown to interact with the death domain (DD) of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1). In this study, we further examined the interaction of the core protein with the signaling molecules of TNFR1, including FADD, TRADD, and TRAF2, in a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK-293, that overexpresses the HCV core protein. This core protein-expressing cell line exhibited enhanced sensitivity to TNF-induced apoptosis. By in vitro binding and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation assays, we showed that the HCV core protein interacted with the DD of FADD and enhanced apoptosis induced by FADD overexpression. This enhancement could be blocked by a dominant-negative mutant of FADD. In contrast, the core protein did not directly interact with the DD of TRADD, but could disrupt the binding of TRADD to TNFR1. TRAF2 recruitment to the TNFR1 signaling complex was also disrupted by the core protein. Correspondingly, TRAF2-dependent activation of the protein kinase JNK was suppressed in the core protein-expressing cells. However, NF kappa B activation by TNF was not significantly altered by the HCV core protein, suggesting the existence of TRAF2-independent pathways for NF kappa B activation. These results combined indicate that the HCV core protein sensitizes cells to TNF-induced apoptosis primarily by facilitating FADD recruitment to TNFR1. The inhibition of JNK activation by the HCV core protein may also contribute to the increased propensity of cells for apoptosis. These results, in comparison with other published studies, suggest that the effects of the HCV core protein and their underlying mechanisms vary significantly among cells of different origins."	0

"The ability to induce cytotoxic T cells is considered an important feature of a candidate hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine. We used an oral immunization strategy with attenuated HCV-NS3-transformed Salmonella typhimurium to deliver DNA directly to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue., HLA-A2.1 transgenic mice were immunized once with transformed attenuated Salmonella. HCV-specific CD8+ T cells were analyzed in vitro as well as in vivo by challenge of mice with recombinant HCV-NS3 vaccinia virus., Salmonella (10(8) colony-forming units; 20 microg plasmid DNA) induced cytotoxic and IFN-gamma-producing CD8+ T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope NS3-1073 in 26 of 30 mice (86%) that persisted for at least 10 months. A second epitope (NS3-1169) was also recognized by cytotoxic and IFN-gamma-producing T cells, whereas a third one (NS3-1406) stimulated IFN-gamma production without cytotoxicity. The minimal amount of plasmid DNA required to induce CTLs was 2 ng. Upon challenge with recombinant HCV-NS3-expressing vaccinia virus, vaccinia titers were significantly lower in mice immunized with Salmonella-NS3 than in mice immunized with control Salmonella, demonstrating the in vivo function of CTLs., Oral immunization with attenuated Salmonella typhimurium as a carrier for HCV DNA induces long-lasting T-cell responses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	11745000	Loss of immunogenecity of liver dendritic cells from mouse with chronic hepatitis.	"Antigen presenting cells, especially the antigen presenting dendritic cells (DC) in the tissue, regulate the magnitude of antigen-specific immune response. A role of impaired and narrowly focused specific immune response has been implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic hepatitis due to hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. In order to clarify this role, we studied liver DC from interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) transgenic mouse (TgM), an animal model of chronic hepatitis. These mice had high serum levels of alanine transaminase and histological evidence of chronic hepatitis. Transgene negative offspring (littermate control) with normal serum transaminase levels and without any evidence of hepatitis were used as controls. The stimulatory capacity of the liver DC from IFN-gamma TgM in allogenic mixed leukocyte reaction was significantly lower than that of the liver DC from control mouse. The endocytosis capacity was significantly lower in liver DC from IFN-gamma TgM than in that from the control mouse. Most importantly, liver DC from IFN-gamma TgM were unable to induce antigen-specific proliferation. The impaired function of liver DC from these mice may be attributable to increased production or induction of suppressor cytokines such as interleukin-10 and nitric oxide. Defective capacity of liver DC from mouse with chronic hepatitis (IFN-gamma TgM) may be related to impaired magnitude of specific immune response in the liver."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	11807688	The hepatitis C virus (HCV)-Trimera mouse: a model for evaluation of agents against HCV.	"The lack of small-animal models that are suitable for evaluation of agents used to treat infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) severely hinders the assessment of potential new therapies for the disease. This study created such a model, termed the \"HCV-Trimera\" model. The HCV-Trimera model was developed by using lethally irradiated mice, reconstituted with SCID mouse bone marrow cells, in which human liver fragments infected ex vivo with HCV had been transplanted. Viremia (positive-strand HCV RNA levels) in HCV-Trimera mice peaked at approximately day 18 after liver transplantation, and an infection rate of 85% was reached. Viral replication in liver grafts was evidenced by the presence of specific negative-strand HCV RNA. The usefulness of this model for evaluation of anti-HCV agents was demonstrated by the ability of a small molecule (an HCV internal ribosomal entry site inhibitor) and an anti-HCV human monoclonal antibody (HCV AB(XTL)68) to reduce virus loads in HCV-Trimera mice in a dose-dependent manner."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	12730885	Expression of hepatitis c virus proteins inhibits interferon alpha signaling in the liver of transgenic mice.	"BACKGROUND & AIMS Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide. The majority of patients treated with interferon alpha do not have a sustained response with clearance of the virus. The molecular mechanisms underlying interferon resistance are poorly understood. Interferon-induced activation of the Jak-STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) signal transduction pathway is essential for the induction of an antiviral state. Interference of viral proteins with the Jak-STAT pathway could be responsible for interferon resistance in patients with chronic HCV., We have analyzed interferon-induced signal transduction through the Jak-STAT pathway in transgenic mice that express HCV proteins in their liver cells. STAT activation was investigated with Western blots, immunofluorescence, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Virus challenge experiments with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus were used to demonstrate the functional importance of Jak-STAT inhibition., STAT signaling was found to be strongly inhibited in liver cells of HCV transgenic mice. The inhibition occurred in the nucleus and blocked binding of STAT transcription factors to the promoters of interferon-stimulated genes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT proteins by Janus kinases at the interferon receptor was not inhibited. This lack in interferon response resulted in an enhanced susceptibility of the transgenic mice to infection with a hepatotropic strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus., Interferon-induced intracellular signaling is impaired in HCV transgenic mice. Interference of HCV proteins with interferon-induced intracellular signaling could be an important mechanism of viral persistence and treatment resistance."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	12764155	Hepatitis C virus core protein differently regulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway under interleukin-6 and interferon-gamma stimuli.	"We established hepatitis C virus (HCV) core-expressing cells and investigated whether HCV core would modify the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator transcription factor (STAT) pathway under interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon (IFN)-gamma stimuli. Phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and STAT3, and STAT3-mediated transcription, were prevented by HCV core under IL-6 stimulation. In contrast, HCV core increased phosphorylation of JAK1/2 and STAT1 and STAT1-mediated transcription under IFN-gamma stimulation. Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis showed that HCV core could bind to JAK1/2. The PGYPWP sequences at codons 79-84 within HCV core were important for interaction with JAKs by in vitro binding analysis. In the reporter gene assay, HCV core-mediated suppression of JAK-STAT pathway under IL-6 stimulation was not observed by abrogation of PGYPWP sequence, suggesting that HCV core/JAK interaction may directly affect the signal transduction. In contrast, augmentation of JAK-STAT pathway was still seen by HCV core without functional PGYPWP sequence under IFN-gamma stimulation. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that HCV core up-regulated of IFN-gamma receptor 2 expression, which may be responsible for HCV core-mediated enhancement of JAK-STAT pathway under IFN-gamma stimulation. In conclusion, HCV core has different effects on the JAK-STAT pathway under IL-6 and IFN-gamma stimuli. This may be exerted by these two independent mechanisms."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	12772504	Therapeutic antibodies against viral hepatitis.	"Antibodies have the potential to be immunotherapeutic agents, used either as stand-alone therapy or as an adjunct for managing chronic viral infection. In addition, antibodies may be used prophylactically in individuals who have been accidentally exposed to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), or to prevent re-infection of the liver in patients who have undergone liver transplantation. Human monoclonal antibodies to HBV and HCV were generated and their ability to reduce viral load was tested in different animal model systems, the Trimera mouse model and HBV-carrier chimpanzees. These antibodies were further developed and are currently being studied in clinical trials for chronic HBV or HCV and in liver transplant patients. The antibodies were shown to be safe, tolerable and could significantly reduce viral load. Their ability to inhibit HCV re-infection in the transplanted liver is being evaluated."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	12794718	Expression of the chemokine IP-10 correlates with the accumulation of hepatic IFN-gamma and IL-18 mRNA in chronic hepatitis C but not in hepatitis B.	"The pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus-induced chronic liver disease is still poorly understood. Previous studies revealed enhanced hepatic expression of the Th1 prototype cytokine IFN-gamma in individuals with chronic hepatitis C. In accordance with several animal models of experimentally induced hepatitis, a Th1 lymphocyte driven inflammatory process, which involves newly infiltrated as well as resident monocytes/macrophages, has been proposed. An involvement of the interferon-gamma-inducible chemokine IP-10, which is chemoattractive for stimulated Th1 cells and monocytes, is also suggested. Using an HBV transgenic mouse model, a reduction of hepatic infiltration and liver disease was achieved recently by administration of antibodies directed against the interferon-gamma-inducible chemokine Mig and against IP-10. In the present study, expression of IP-10 was investigated both in serum and in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis C and hepatitis B. Patients with liver diseases of non-viral etiologies served as controls. IP-10 expression was highest in hepatitis C. In chronic hepatitis C, but not in chronic hepatitis B nor in liver disorders unrelated to viral infections, IP-10 expression was strongly correlated with the amount of transcripts for IFN-gamma and to the amount of transcripts for the constitutively expressed macrophage derived cytokine IL-18. Hepatic inflammatory activity, however, was found to be associated more closely with IFN-gamma than with IP-10 or IL-18 mRNA expression. The data support the hypothesis that IP-10 is responsible for the recruitment of Th cells and monocytes in chronic hepatitis C, and suggest that its role in chronic hepatitis B is less determining. Moreover, they deliver additional support for the view that IFN-gamma still has to be considered as a mediator that determines the outcome of inflammation, e.g., via its ability to activate IL-18 expressing cells and to initiate a delayed type hypersensitivity reaction."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	12915536	Replication of hepatitis C virus subgenomes in nonhepatic epithelial and mouse hepatoma cells.	"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) pandemic affects the health of more than 170 million people and is the major indication for orthotopic liver transplantations. Although the human liver is the primary site for HCV replication, it is not known whether extrahepatic tissues are also infected by the virus and whether nonprimate cells are permissive for RNA replication. Because HCV exists as a quasispecies, it is conceivable that a viral population may include variants that can replicate in different cell types and in other species. We have tested this hypothesis and found that subgenomic HCV RNAs can replicate in mouse hepatoma and nonhepatic human epithelial cells. Replicons isolated from these cell lines carry new mutations that could be involved in the control of tropism of the virus. Our results demonstrated that translation and RNA-directed RNA replication of HCV do not depend on hepatocyte or primate-specific factors. Moreover, our results could open the path for the development of animal models for HCV infection."	0

"Type II mixed cryoglobulinaemia (MC) is a systemic vasculitis, associated in most cases with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and sustained by proliferation of oligoclonal cells. Systemic B-cell depletion and clinical remission can be achieved in non-Hodgkin lymphoma by a human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically reacts with the CD20 antigen (Rituximab). Similar effects could be expected in type II MC., Six patients, mean age 64.2 years (range: 37-76 years), with HCV infection genotype 2a2c (three cases) or 1b (three cases) and symptomatic type-II MC with systemic manifestations, including renal involvement (five cases) and bone marrow clonal restriction (three cases), were considered eligible for Rituximab therapy. Rituximab was administered intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) on days 1, 8, 15 and 22. Two more doses were administered 1 and 2 months later. No other immunosuppressive drugs were added. Response was evaluated by assessing the changes in clinical signs, symptoms and laboratory parameters for < or = 18 months., Levels of proteinuria, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and cryocrit significantly decreased at 2, 6 and 12 months. Rheumatoid factor and IgM significantly decreased at 6 months whereas C4 values significantly increased at 2 and 6 months. HCV viral load and immunoglobulin G remained stable. Bone marrow abnormalities were found to reverse to normal in all three positive cases. Constitutional symptoms (skin ulcers, purpura, arthralgia, weakness, paraesthesia and fever) disappeared or improved. No acute or delayed side effects were observed., Rituximab appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in symptomatic patients with HCV-associated MC glomerulonephritis and signs of systemic vasculitis."	0

"A small animal model harboring a functional human liver cell xenograft would be a useful tool to study human liver cell biology, drug metabolism, and infections with hepatotropic viruses. Here we describe the repopulation, organization, and function of human hepatocytes in a mouse recipient and the infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) of the transplanted cells. Homozygous urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)-SCID mice underwent transplantation with primary human hepatocytes, and at different times animals were bled and sacrificed to analyze plasma and liver tissue, respectively. The plasma of mice that were successfully transplanted contained albumin and an additional 21 human proteins. Liver histology showed progressive and massive replacement of diseased mouse tissue by human hepatocytes. These cells were accumulating glycogen but appeared otherwise normal and showed no signs of damage or death. They formed functional bile canaliculi that connected to mouse canaliculi. Besides mature hepatocytes, human hepatic progenitor cells that were differentiating into mature hepatocytes could be identified within liver parenchyma. Infection of chimeric mice with HBV or HCV resulted in an active infection that did not alter the liver function and architecture. Electron microscopy showed the presence of viral and subviral structures in HBV infected hepatocytes. In conclusion, human hepatocytes repopulate the uPA(+/+)-SCID mouse liver in a very organized fashion with preservation of normal cell function. The presence of human hepatic progenitor cells in these chimeric animals necessitates a critical review of the observations and conclusions made in experiments with isolated \"mature\" hepatocytes.

mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	15953767	Small hairpin RNAs efficiently inhibit hepatitis C IRES-mediated gene expression in human tissue culture cells and a mouse model.	"Treatment and prevention of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain a major challenge for controlling this worldwide health problem; existing therapies are only partially effective and no vaccine is currently available. RNA interference offers the potential of a novel therapeutic approach for treating HCV infections. Toward this end, we evaluated small hairpin interfering RNAs (shRNAs) targeting the conserved internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element of the HCV genome for their ability to control gene expression in human cells and animals. We used a reporter gene plasmid in which firefly luciferase (fLuc) expression is dependent on the HCV IRES. Direct delivery of HCV IRES shRNAs efficiently blocked HCV IRES-mediated fLuc expression in transfected human 293FT cells as well as in a mouse model in which nucleic acids were delivered to liver cells by hydrodynamic transfection via the tail vein. These results indicate that shRNAs, delivered as RNA or expressed from viral or nonviral vectors, may be effective agents for the control of HCV and related viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	16051865	Parenchymal expression of CD86/B7.2 contributes to hepatitis C virus-related liver injury.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major global health problem. Hepatic expression of immune costimulatory signaling molecules (e.g., B7) is known to be associated with ongoing liver injury in hepatitis C patients. However, due to the general lack of viral culture systems and adequate animal models, the function of these molecules in disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. To investigate the role of CD86 in HCV-related liver injury, we developed two transgenic mouse lineages with inducible expression of HCV structural proteins and constitutive expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86/B7.2 in the liver. Using a hydrodynamic-based, nonviral delivery protocol, we induced HCV transgene expression in the livers of HCV and CD86 single- and double-transgenic mice. We found that hepatic CD86 expression resulted in increased activation of and cytokine production (e.g., interleukin-2 and gamma interferon) by CD4+ T cells and that the retention of these cells was associated with more pronounced necroinflammatory lesions in the liver. Taken together, these data suggest that augmented, parenchymal antigen presentation conferred by hepatocyte CD86 expression alters homeostasis and effector functions of CD4+ T cells and contributes to liver injury. This study provides an additional rationale for exploring immunomodulation-based therapies that could reduce disease progression in individuals with chronic HCV infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	16053919	A C-terminal truncated hepatitis C virus core protein variant assembles in vitro into virus-like particles in the absence of structured nucleic acids.	"Little is known about the assembly pathway or structure of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). In this work a truncated HCcAg variant covering the first 120 aa (HCcAg.120) with a 32 aa N-terminal fusion peptide (6x Histag-Xpress epitope) was purified as a monomer under strong denaturing conditions. In addition, minor HCcAg.120 peaks exhibiting little different molecular mass by SDS-PAGE which possibly represents alternative forms harboring the N-termini of HCcAg.120 were detected. Analysis using gel filtration chromatography showed that HCcAg.120 assembled into high molecular weight structures in vitro in the absence of structured nucleic acids. The negative-stain electron microscopy analysis revealed that these structures correspond with spherical VLPs of uniform morphology and size distribution. The diameters of these particles ranged from 20 to 43nm with an average diameter of approximately 30 nm and were specifically immunolabelled with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the residues 5-35 of HCcAg. Results presented in this work showed that HCcAg.120 assembled in vitro into VLPs in the absence of structured nucleic acids with similar morphology and size distribution to those found in sera and hepatocytes from HCV-infected patients. Therefore, these VLPs would be important to elucidate the mechanisms behind the ability of HCcAg to assemble into a nucleocapsid structure."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	16831601	Deletion of the SOCS3 gene in liver parenchymal cells promotes hepatitis-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.	"A recent study has suggested that the methylation silencing of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of interleukin-6-related cytokines, could be involved in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the roles of SOCS3 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis and hepatitis have not been established. We investigated the effect of deleting the SOCS3 gene on the development of hepatitis and HCC in hepatitis C virus-infected patients and mouse models., The expression of SOCS genes in HCC and non-HCC regions of patient samples was determined by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. The conditional knockout approach in mice was used to determine the hepatocyte-specific roles of SOCS3. To generate a liver-specific deletion, floxed SOCS3 (SOCS3(fl/fl)) mice were crossed with albumin-Cre transgenic mice. Hepatitis and HCC were induced by administering concanavalin A and diethylnitrosamine, respectively., SOCS3 expression was reduced in the HCC regions compared with the non-HCC regions. Carcinogen-induced hepatic tumor development was enhanced by deletion of the SOCS3 gene, which was associated with higher levels of the targets of signal transducers and activators of transcription (ie, B-cell lymphoma-XL, B-cell lymphoma-2, C-myelocytomatosis, cyclin D1, and vascular endothelial growth factor). In the concanavalin A-mediated hepatitis model, deletion of the SOCS3 gene in the hepatocytes protected against liver injury through suppression of interferon-gamma signaling and induction of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL., Deletion of the SOCS3 gene in hepatocytes promotes the activation of STAT3, resistance to apoptosis, and an acceleration of proliferation, resulting in enhanced hepatitis-induced hepatocarcinogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	17005803	Novel robust hepatitis C virus mouse efficacy model.	"The lack of a robust small-animal model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has hindered the discovery and development of novel drug treatments for HCV infections. We developed a reproducible and easily accessible xenograft mouse efficacy model in which HCV RNA replication is accurately monitored in vivo by real-time, noninvasive whole-body imaging of gamma-irradiated SCID mice implanted with a mouse-adapted luciferase replicon-containing Huh-7 cell line (T7-11). The model was validated by demonstrating that both a small-molecule NS3/4A protease inhibitor (BILN 2061) and human alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) decreased HCV RNA replication and that treatment withdrawal resulted in a rebound in replication, which paralleled clinical outcomes in humans. We further showed that protease inhibitor and IFN-alpha combination therapy was more effective in reducing HCV RNA replication than treatment with each compound alone and supports testing in humans. This robust mouse efficacy model provides a powerful tool for rapid evaluation of potential anti-HCV compounds in vivo as part of aggressive drug discovery efforts."	0

"HCV-AB68, a human monoclonal antibody against the envelope protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV), neutralizes HCV in cell-culture and in the HCV-Trimera mouse model. A Phase 1 clinical trial was designed to test safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of HCV-AB68 in patients with chronic HCV-infection., Single doses of HCV-AB68, 0.25-40 mg, administered to 15 patients were well tolerated with no moderate or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported. In six patients, HCV-RNA levels transiently decreased by 2- to 100-fold immediately following infusion and rebound to baseline in 24-48 h. Multiple doses of HCV-AB68, 10-120 mg, were administered to 25 patients. Doses were given weekly for 3 weeks, then 3x a week during the fourth week, after which patients were followed for 3 months. No drug-related SAEs were reported and no specific pattern of adverse events was evident. Eight out of 25 patients had at least a 1-log reduction and 17 had at least a 0.75-log reduction in HCV-RNA levels from baseline at one or more time points following HCV-AB68 infusion., These data support the investigation of HCV-AB68 in the prevention of recurrent HCV-infection in patients who had received hepatic allografts for end-stage liver disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	17322382	Thymic stromal lymphopoietin transgenic mice develop cryoglobulinemia and hepatitis with similarities to human hepatitis C liver disease.	"Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia in humans is strongly associated with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. It remains controversial whether liver injury in hepatitis C is primarily attributable to direct viral cytopathic effect or to an immune-mediated response. We characterized the role of cryoglobulinemia in the development of liver disease in thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) transgenic mice that produce mixed cryoglobulinemia and develop hepatitis. The role of immune complexes in this animal model was evaluated using techniques of light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. To assess the role of Fc receptor engagement in mediation of the disease, TSLP transgenic mice were crossbred with mice deficient for immunoglobulin-binding receptor gamma IIb (FcgammaRIIb). Livers from the TSLP transgenic animals showed mild to moderate liver injury, minimal to mild fibrosis, and deposition of immunoglobulin around the portal tracts. TSLP transgenic mice deficient in inhibitory FcgammaRIIb had more severe hepatitis and accelerated mortality. TSLP-associated hepatitis bears strong similarity to hepatitis C virus-related hepatitis as it occurs in humans, making this a valuable model system of chronic hepatitis and fibrosis to study therapies aimed at manipulating immune responses. Periportal immune complex deposition may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis occurring in the setting of systemic cryoglobulinemia."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	17341188	The role of NKT cells in animal models of autoimmune hepatitis.	"NKT cells expressing invariant T-cell receptors are an abundant cell population in the mouse liver, and much evidence has been accumulating which shows that they play an important role in immune responses in this organ. In this review, the putative function of NKT cells in autoimmune hepatitis is discussed based on results from various mouse models. Features and functions of invariant NKT cells are summarized to set the stage to explain how these cells induce liver injury following the injection of mitogen concanavalin A or NKT-cell receptor ligand alpha-GalCer. Results are discussed which show that alcohol consumption can aggravate liver injury by NKT cells, whereas expression of a hepatitis C virus protein in hepatocytes can protect against injury. Hepatocytes, therefore, can modulate sensitivity to NKT-cell-mediated attack. Moreover, experiments that elucidate how NKT cells induce liver injury and how they are regulated to perform this function are discussed. Specific attention is given to the recently discovered role of purinergic receptor P2X7 in regulating NKT cells. The conclusion is drawn that the P2X7 receptor constitutes a sensor that senses purine-based danger signals, which trigger mechanisms that cause inhibition or stimulation of NKT-cell functions."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	17392480	Hepatitis C virus core protein increases mitochondrial ROS production by stimulation of Ca2+ uniporter activity.	"Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to alter mitochondrial function. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) produces a viral core protein that targets to mitochondria and increases Ca2+-dependent ROS production. The aim of this study was to determine whether core's effects are mediated by changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Core expression caused enhanced mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake in response to ER Ca2+ release induced by thapsigargin or ATP. It also increased mitochondrial superoxide production and mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Incubating mouse liver mitochondria with an HCV core (100 ng/mg) in vitro increased Ca2+ entry rate by approximately 2-fold. Entry was entirely inhibited by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor, Ru-360, but not influenced by an Na+/Ca2+ exchanger inhibitor or ROS scavengers. These results indicate that core directly increases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake via a primary effect on the uniporter. This enhanced the ability of mitochondria to sequester Ca2+ in response to ER Ca2+ release, and increased mitochondrial ROS production and MPT. Thus, the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter is a newly identified target for viral modification of cell function."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	17464996	Directed differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into functional hepatic cells.	"The differentiation capacity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) holds great promise for therapeutic applications. We report a novel three-stage method to efficiently direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hepatic cells in serum-free medium. Human ESCs were first differentiated into definitive endoderm cells by 3 days of Activin A treatment. Next, the presence of fibroblast growth factor-4 and bone morphogenetic protein-2 in the culture medium for 5 days induced efficient hepatic differentiation from definitive endoderm cells. Approximately 70% of the cells expressed the hepatic marker albumin. After 10 days of further in vitro maturation, these cells expressed the adult liver cell markers tyrosine aminotransferase, tryptophan oxygenase 2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), Cyp7A1, Cyp3A4 and Cyp2B6. Furthermore, these cells exhibited functions associated with mature hepatocytes including albumin secretion, glycogen storage, indocyanine green, and low-density lipoprotein uptake, and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. When transplanted into CCl4 injured severe combined immunodeficiency mice, these cells integrated into the mouse liver and expressed human alpha-1 antitrypsin for at least 2 months. In addition, we found that the hESC-derived hepatic cells were readily infected by human immunodeficiency virus-hepatitis C virus pseudotype viruses., We have developed an efficient way to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cells that exhibit characteristics of mature hepatocytes. Our studies should facilitate searching the molecular mechanisms underlying human liver development, and form the basis for hepatocyte transplantation and drug tests."	0

"We designed and evaluated in HLA-class I transgenic mouse models a hepatitis C virus (HCV) T cell-based MVA vectored vaccine expressing three viral antigens known to be targets of potent CD8+- and CD4+-mediated responses. An accelerated (3 week-based) vaccination induced specific CD8+ T cells harboring two effector functions (cytolytic activity - both in vitro and in vivo- and production of IFNgamma) as well as specific CD4+ T cells recognizing all three vaccine antigens. Responses were long lasting (6 months), boostable by a fourth MVA vaccination and in vivo cross-reactive as demonstrated in a surrogate Listeria-based challenge assay. This candidate vaccine has now moved into clinical trials."	0

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes persistent infection and induces chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and finally hepatocellular carcinoma. Current therapies for HCV infection have not been satisfactory, and more effective anti-viral treatments are needed. In this regard, detailed analysis of HCV has been hampered by a lack of appropriate viral culture systems and small animal models of infection. However, rapid progress in HCV research has recently been achieved, such as a subgenomic replicon system, a viral culture system using JFH-1 clone and the Alb-uPA/SCID mouse transplanted with human liver cells. Such progress will propel HCV research and anti-HCV drug discovery toward the next generation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	18270864	Rituximab as a therapeutic tool in severe mixed cryoglobulinemia.	"Type II mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is a systemic vasculitis, associated in most cases with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, sustained by proliferation of oligoclonal cells. Systemic B cell depletion and clinical remission can be achieved in non-Hodgkin lymphoma by human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that specifically reacts with the CD20 antigen (rituximab). Similar effects could be expected in type II MC. Twelve patients, mean age 61.9 years (range 37-76), 11 with HCV infection genotype 2a2c (4 cases) or 1b (6 cases) and 3 (1 case) and symptomatic type II MC with systemic manifestations, including renal involvement, marrow clonal restriction, large necrotizing ulcers, and polyneuropathy, were considered eligible for rituximab therapy because of resistance or intolerance to conventional therapy or important bone marrow infiltration. Rituximab was administered intravenously at a dose of 375 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Two more doses were administered 1 and 2 months later. No other immunosuppressive drugs were added. Response was evaluated by assessing the changes in clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory parameters. Levels of proteinuria, hematuria, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, cryocrit, rheumatoid factor, and IgM decreased while C4 values increased and HCV viral load remained stable during short- and medium-term observation. Bone marrow abnormalities were found to reverse to normal. Constitutional symptoms disappeared or ameliorated. No acute or delayed side effects were seen. Based on this experience and a number of reports published in the last 5 years, Rituximab appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic option in symptomatic patients with HCV-associated MC with signs of systemic vasculitis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	18452146	Polyclonal immunoglobulins from a chronic hepatitis C virus patient protect human liver-chimeric mice from infection with a homologous hepatitis C virus strain.	"The role of the humoral immune response in the natural course of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is widely debated. Most chronically infected patients have immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies capable of neutralizing HCV pseudoparticles (HCVpp) in vitro. It is, however, not clear whether these IgG can prevent a de novo HCV infection in vivo and contribute to the control of viremia in infected individuals. We addressed this question with homologous in vivo protection studies in human liver-urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA)(+/+) severe combined immune deficient (SCID) mice. Chimeric mice were loaded with chronic phase polyclonal IgG and challenged 3 days later with a 100% infectious dose of the acute phase H77C virus, both originating from patient H. Passive immunization induced sterilizing immunity in five of eight challenged animals. In the three nonprotected animals, the HCV infection was attenuated, as evidenced by altered viral kinetics in comparison with five control IgG-treated animals. Plasma samples obtained from the mice at viral challenge neutralized H77C-HCVpp at dilutions as high as 1/400. Infection was completely prevented when, before administration to naïve chimeric mice, the inoculum was pre-incubated in vitro at an IgG concentration normally observed in humans., Polyclonal IgG from a patient with a long-standing HCV infection not only displays neutralizing activity in vitro using the HCVpp system, but also conveys sterilizing immunity toward the ancestral HCV strain in vivo, using the human liver-chimeric mouse model. Both experimental systems will be useful tools to identify neutralizing antibodies for future clinical use."	0

"A major problem in hepatitis C virus (HCV) immunotherapy or vaccine design is the extreme variability of the virus. We identified human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize genetically diverse HCV isolates and protect against heterologous HCV quasispecies challenge in a human liver-chimeric mouse model. The results provide evidence that broadly neutralizing antibodies to HCV protect against heterologous viral infection and suggest that a prophylactic vaccine against HCV may be achievable."	0

"Gene electro-transfer (GET) increases DNA uptake and expression by muscle cells following intramuscular plasmid injection. This technology has been used to increase the production of therapeutic proteins, such as cytokines and growth factors, and to improve immunization efficiency following the injection of antigen-encoding plasmids., Hepatitis C virus (HCV) E2 and cytokine encoding plasmids were co-injected in the mouse quadriceps with or without GET and vaccination outcome was monitored by analysis of antigen-specific cellular-mediated or antibody-mediated immunity., GET co-injection of cytokine-encoding and HCV E2-encoding plasmids strongly enhanced T- or B-cell responses to various levels, depending on the particular combination used., We propose that a cocktail of plasmids followed by GET can be the most efficient and fine-tunable approach for genetic immunization."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	18689426	Cleavage of the IPS-1/Cardif/MAVS/VISA does not inhibit T cell-mediated elimination of hepatitis C virus non-structural 3/4A-expressing hepatocytes.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) effectively establishes persistent infection in human livers. The non-structural (NS) 3/4A complex participates in this process by cleavage of interferon beta (IFN beta) promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1; also termed Cardif/MAVS/VISA), which inhibits responses to double stranded (ds) RNA. However, it is not known whether this effect extends beyond innate responses., To test if HCV NS3/4A affects innate and adaptive immune responses in vivo., NS3 levels were semi-quantified in human liver biopsies, transfected cells, and in transgenic (Tg) mouse livers by western blot. The effect of NS3/4A on dsRNA-mediated signalling and on the integrity of IPS-1 was analysed using in vitro translation, transfected cells and Tg mice. Cytotoxic T cell (CTL)-mediated clearance of transient firefly luciferase (FLuc)- and/or NS3/4A-Tg hepatocytes was determined using in vivo imaging and western blot., NS3 protein levels were in a comparable range (0.1-49 microg/g tissue) in infected human livers and Tg mouse livers. Importantly, these levels of NS3/4A reduced murine innate responses to synthetic dsRNA in vivo, supporting the possibility that this occurs also in infected humans. The likely explanation for this was the NS3/4A-mediated cleavage of mouse IPS-1, albeit less efficiently than human IPS-1. Despite this, FLuc- and/or NS3/4A-expressing murine hepatocytes were effectively eliminated by hepatic CTLs, utilising the classical molecules for virus-infected cell lysis, including CD8, IFN gamma, perforin and FasL., Although HCV NS3/4A inhibits the innate immunity, this does not prevent CTL-mediated clearance of NS3/4A-expressing hepatocytes in vivo. Thus, other HCV proteins are most likely responsible for interfering with the adaptive immunity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	18706933	The human liver-uPA-SCID mouse: a model for the evaluation of antiviral compounds against HBV and HCV.	"The study of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis C virus (HCV) has long been hampered by the lack of a suitable small animal model. Both viruses could only be studied in humans or in chimpanzees. Recently, a new chimeric mouse model was developed that was permissive for HBV and HCV infection. In this model, uPA+/+-SCID mice, suffering from a transgene-induced liver disease, are transplanted early after birth with primary human hepatocytes. These human hepatocytes integrate in the parenchyma and progressively repopulate the diseased mouse liver without losing their normal metabolic functions. Successfully transplanted mice can then be infected with HBV and HCV. In this review, we describe the characteristics of this chimeric mouse model in more detail and give an overview of how this model has already contributed to the development of new antiviral compounds for the treatment of viral hepatitis."	1

"Estimates of hepatitis C virus infection include 170 million people worldwide, who face increased risk of development of cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Standard of care therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin is effective in just half of patients, is challenged by substantial treatment-related morbidity, and is prohibitively expensive in most parts of the world. New therapeutics for treatment and prevention are clearly needed.

"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the major human hepatic RNA viruses. Recently, we developed a liver-specific siRNA delivery technology using DTC-Apo composed of cationic liposomes (DTC) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I). Here, we investigated whether DTC-Apo nanoparticles can systemically deliver siRNA into mouse hepatocytes expressing HCV proteins and inhibit their expression efficiently., A transient HCV model was constructed by hydrodynamic injection of plasmid DNA expressing viral structural proteins under hepatic control region and alpha1-antitrypsin promoter elements. Using this model, DTC-Apo containing HCV-core-specific siRNA was intravenously injected to assess antiviral activity as well as the duration of silencing., Post-administration of DTC-Apo/HCV-specific siRNA at a dose of 2mg siRNA/kg inhibited viral gene expression by 65-75% in the liver on day 2. Improved activity (95% knockdown on day 2) without immunotoxicity was obtained by 2'-OMe-modification at two U sequences on its sense strand. Notably, the gene silencing effect of the modified siRNA was still maintained at day 6, while the unmodified one lost RNAi activity after day 4., Our results suggest that DTC-Apo liposome is a highly potential delivery vehicle to transfer therapeutic siRNA especially targeting HCV to the liver."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	19428866	T-cell vaccines that elicit effective immune responses against HCV in chimpanzees may create greater immune pressure for viral mutation.	"A prime/boost vaccine strategy that transfects antigen-presenting cells using ligand-modified immunoliposomes to efficiently deliver plasmid DNA, followed by boosting with non-replicating recombinant adenovirus was used in chimpanzees to generate HCV-specific memory T-cells. Three chimpanzees (two vaccines, one control) were immunized with immunoliposomes complexed with DNA expressing NS3-NS5B or complexed with empty vector. Animals were boosted with adenovirus expressing NS3-NS5B, or non-recombinant adenovirus (control). Using liposome delivery we were able to obtain specific HCV responses following DNA priming in the chimpanzees. This data and mouse immunization studies confirm this as a more efficient delivery system than direct intramuscular inoculations with naked DNA. Subsequent to the adenovirus boost significant increases in peripheral HCV-specific T-cell responses and intrahepatic IFN-gamma and CD3varepsilon mRNA were also observed in the two vaccinated animals. Following challenge (100 CID(50)) both vaccinated animals showed immediate and significant control of viral replication (peak titers 3.7x10(4) and 9x10(3)IU/mL at weeks 1 and 2), which coincided with increases in HCV-specific T-cell responses. Viral kinetics in the control animal were comparable to historical controls with exponential increases in titer during the first several weeks. One vaccinated animal developed a low-level persistent infection (2x10(3)IU/mL) which correlated with a decrease in HCV-specific T-cell responses. Circulating virus isolated from both vaccinated animals showed approximately 2-fold greater nonsynonymous mutation rates compared to controls and the nonsynonymous/synonymous mutation rate ratio was indicative of positive selection. These data suggest that although T-cell vaccines can induce immune responses capable of controlling HCV, they also induce high levels of immune pressure for the potential selection of escape mutants."	0

"The lack of a robust small animal model for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has hindered the development of novel drugs, including internal ribosome entry site (IRES) inhibitors. Phage phiC31 integrase has emerged as a potent tool for achieving long-term gene expression in vivo. This study utilized phiC31 integrase to develop a stable, reproducible and easily accessible HCV IRES mouse model., phiC31 integrase plasmid and the reporter vector, HCV-IRES-luciferase expression cassette (containing an attB site), was codelivered to murine livers using high pressure tail vein injection. HCV IRES-dependent translation reflected by luciferase expression was accurately monitored in vivo by bioluminescence imaging. Genomic integration of the transgene was confirmed by partial hepatectomy and nested PCR. An HCV IRES-targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid, sh184, was hydrodynamically transfected into mouse liver to study its inhibition efficacy in vivo., phiC31 integrase mediated intramolecular recombination between wild-type attB and attP sites in mice. The expression of luciferase was stable after 30 days post-transfection and remained so for 300 days only in the livers of mice that were coinjected with the integrase-encoding plasmid. Luciferase levels reduced dramatically after hydrodynamic transfection of sh184., These results indicate that this mouse model provides a powerful tool for accurate and long-term evaluation of potential anti-IRES compounds in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	19489072	PCSK9 impedes hepatitis C virus infection in vitro and modulates liver CD81 expression.	"Human PCSK9 is known to enhance the degradation of membrane-bound receptors such as the hepatocyte low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), ApoER2, and very low-density lipoprotein receptor. Because the LDLR is suspected to be involved in hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry, we also tested whether PCSK9 can affect the levels of CD81, a major HCV receptor. Interestingly, stable expression of PCSK9 or a more active membrane-bound form of the protein (PCSK9-ACE2) resulted in a marked reduction in CD81 and LDLR expression. Therefore, we analyzed the antiviral effect of PCSK9 in vitro using the HCV genotype 2a (JFH1) virus. The results clearly demonstrated that cells expressing PCSK9 or PCSK9-ACE2, but not the ACE2 control protein, were resistant to HCV infection. Furthermore, addition of purified soluble PCSK9 to cell culture supernatant impeded HCV infection in a dose-dependent manner. As expected, HuH7 cells expressing PCSK9-ACE2 were also resistant to infection by HCV pseudoparticles. In addition, we showed that CD81 cell surface expression is modulated by PCSK9 in an LDLR-independent manner. Finally, in the liver of single Pcsk9 and double (Pcsk9 + Ldlr) knockout mice, both LDLR and/or CD81 protein expression levels were significantly reduced, but not those of transferrin and scavenger receptor class B type 1., Our results demonstrate an antiviral effect of the circulating liver PCSK9 on HCV in cells and show that PCSK9 down-regulates the level of mouse liver CD81 expression in vivo. Therefore, we propose that the plasma level and/or activity of PCSK9 may modulate HCV infectivity in humans."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	19674968	The hepatitis C virus non-structural NS5A protein impairs both the innate and adaptive hepatic immune response in vivo.	"The role of hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein non-structural (NS) 5A in HCV-associated pathogenesis is still enigmatic. To investigate the in vivo role of NS5A for viral persistence and virus-associated pathogenesis a transgenic (Tg) mouse model was established. Mice with liver-targeted NS5A transgene expression were generated using the albumin promoter. Alterations in the hepatic immune response were determined by Western blot, infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), and using transient NS3/4A Tg mice generated by hydrodynamic injection. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity was investigated by the Cr-release assay. The stable NS5A Tg mice did not reveal signs of spontaneous liver disease. The intrahepatic immunity was disrupted in the NS5A Tg mice as determined by clearance of LCMV infection or transiently NS3/4A Tg hepatocytes in vivo. This impaired immunity was explained by a reduced induction of interferon beta, 2',5'-OAS, and PKR after LCMV infection and an impairment of the CTL-mediated elimination of NS3-expressing hepatocytes. In conclusion, these data indicate that in the present transgenic mouse model, NS5A does not cause spontaneous liver disease. However, we discovered that NS5A could impair both the innate and the adaptive immune response to promote chronic HCV infection."	0

"The adult mouse inoculated intracerebrally with 6/94 strain of parainfluenza type 1 virus developed selective degenerative lesions in cerebral white matter. Ultrastrucrally, the infiltration of mononuclear cells, mostly lymphoid cells, apparently preceded the alterations of white matter parenchyma. The prominent feature of the white matter lesion was a lytic degeneration of both axon and myelin that seemed to be triggered by the mononuclear cell infiltration. Nucleocapsids of paramyxovirus were found only in ependymal cells and the very early stages of the infection. It is suggested that the mechanism of the white matter degeneration might be that of a virus-induced cell-mediated immune response directed at both the axon and myelin."	0

"The general capacity of germfree mouse spleen cells to produce interferon in vitro in response to various stimuli was investigated. The interferon response of germfree mouse spleen cells in vitro, when compared with that of the conventionals, appears to be lower to some inducers. Interferon production in vitro stimulated by hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ) or BHK-HVJ cells (BHK cells persistently infected with HVJ) was apparently suppressed in germfree mouse spleen cells as compared with the corresponding conventionals, whereas no difference of interferon production was observed between germfree and conventional mouse spleen cells in response to Newcastle disease virus, Escherichia coli endotoxin, poly(I:C), and phytohemagglutinin. Although monocontamination with HVJ had no enhancing effect on the interferon-producing ability of germfree mouse spleen cells in response to HVJ, conventionalization for 2 weeks greatly enhanced interferon-producing capacity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	183211	Transfer of tRNAs to somatic cells mediated by Sendai-virus-induced fusion.	"tRNAs from yeast (tRNAPhe and 4S RNA) and Escherichia coli (suIII+ tRNAITyr) have been transferred to mouse cells by means of a two-step transfer procedure [Loyter, Zakai, and Kulka (1975) J. Cell Biol. 66, 292-304; Schlegel and Rechsteiner (1975) Cell 5, 371-379]. In the first stage of the transfer tRNAs were incorporated into rabbit red blood cells (RBCs). Thereafter, the loaded erythrocytes were fused with recipient mouse cells by means of Sendai virus. At least 0.3-0.4% of the total input of tRNA used to load the RBCs could be transferred to mouse cells. Of the tRNA incorporated in the mouse cells, at least 50% could be recovered in the form of intact tRNA molecules when yeast 4S RNA was used. With E. coli suIII+ tRNAITyr a rather smaller proportion of the tRNA remained intact (33%). Although the loading of tRNA into RBCs is not essential for its uptake, we find that the transfer is four times more efficient with RBCs as a vehicle for the injection. Significantly, a fraction (2%) of the recipient cells possessed much more incorporated tRNA than the average cell when Sendai virus and loaded RBCs were used. Such cells were not found in control experiments in which tRNA uptake was induced by Sendai virus alone."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	194551	Interferon production and response to exogenous interferon in two cell lines of mouse brain origin persistently infected with Sendai virus.	"Two persistently infected cell lines established from C3H mouse brain cells infected in vivo with Sendai virus were shown to differ with respect to interferon (IF) production and response to exogenous IF. MB/Sen carrier cells contained 1-5 per cent antigen positive cells when examined by immunofluorescence, and virus was occasionally recovered from the culture medium. MB/SenAS carrier cells were maintained with 0.16 per cent Sendai antiserum in the supernatant medium. All MB/SenAS cells contained viral antigen and infectious virus was present in the culture medium. MB/Sen released IF spontaneously into the culture medium. Further IF production could be stimulated in MB/Sen by superinfection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Exogenous IF provided good protection against VSV challenge. In contrast, MB/SenAS produced no IF spontaneously but could be stimulated by NDV and VSV to produce IF. Exogenous IF failed to reduce the amount of VSV released into the supernatant fluid. Replication of VSV was restricted in MB/SenAS as shown by a 2.3 log10 lower virus yield compared to MB/Sen."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	219358	Reconstruction of cells by Sendai virus-induced fusion of cell fragments.	"Large numbers of animal cells can be enucleated by centrifugation in the presence of cytochalasin. The nuclei (minicells) obtained by this technique are surrounded by a thin rim of cytoplasm and a cell membrane. The cytoplasms (anucleate cells) contain cytoplasmic organelles and are capable of protein synthesis. By themselves, these cell fragments are not viable under usual culture conditions for longer than 2 days after enucleation. They can, however, be fused by UV-inactivated Sendai virus to form reconstituted cells. Nuclei from rat myoblasts have been combined with cytoplasms from mouse fibroblasts. The resulting reconstituted cells are viable and multiply rapidly in vitro. Enucleation or disruption of \"micronucleated\" cells, cells in which the genome has been fragmented into many small micronuclei by prolonged exposure to antimitotic agents results in microcells. These cell fragments are subdiploid and may contain as little as a single chromosome. Fusion of microcells from normal cells with intact mutant cells offers a method of transferring complementing chromosomes into genetically defective cells. Specific areas in which reconstitution techniques should prove useful include studies of gene expression, cell differentiation, and the dependence of mitochondria on nuclear genes. Microcell hybrids could be useful in chromosome mapping and gene complementation analysis."	0

"Mice infected with influenza A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus or Sendai/960 paramyxovirus were treated by inhalations of aerosol aprotinin, a broad spectrum inhibitor of proteinases. A course of inhalations of finely dispersed aerosol aprotinin including 4 exposures of 35-40 min each daily for 6 days provided respiratory administration of aprotinin in a dose about 100 kallikrein-inhibiting U/mouse per day. In mice treated by aprotinin inhalations, histological examinations showed decreased pulmonary pathology, and their body weights increased as much as in uninfected animals. In the placebo group, the weight decreased until the death of the animals. The protective effect of aprotinin inhalations was 40-80% with inoculation doses 10-100 MLD50/mouse.

Forty-seven young were obtained from these recipients (61.8% of development rate) and 46 young were successfully reared up to 10th week of age. All the recipients and the young were negative by testing SV antibody. These results indicate that the embryo transfer technique is useful for cleaning of SV-infected mice."	0

"Sixty 5 to 8 week old Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD)BR) rats were inoculated intranasally with 2000 egg infectious doses of egg-propagated Sendai virus. Virus was recovered from the upper respiratory tract and lungs on days 1 through 8 post-inoculation (PI). Serum antibody responses were measured for 12 rats over a 9 month period PI. Antibody was first detected at 7 days, peaked at 21 days, and was detected in 5 of the 12 rats at 9 months. A cell-mediated response, as measured by lymphocyte blastogenesis, also was detected at 7 days and peaked at 21 days, but was not detected at 6 months PI. Lung and serum interferon (IFN) was first detected at 3 hours and peaked at 6 hours, but was not detected by 160 hours. Lung IFN levels were 4 to 10 times those in the serum. These studies indicate that pathogenesis of Sendai virus infection in the rat is similar to that reported in the mouse, but that there are differences in the kinetics of both viral replication and morphologic changes, as described in the companion paper."	0

"Our previous study has shown that, although a trypsin-resistant mutant of Sendai virus, TR-2, replicates only in a single cycle in mouse lung with a negligible lesion, the animal acquires a strong immunity against lethal infection with wild-type Sendai virus, suggesting that TR-2 could be used as a new type of live vaccine (M. Tashiro and M. Homma, J. Virol. 53:228-234, 1985). In the present study, we investigated the immunological response elicited in TR-2-infected mice, particularly with respect to cell-mediated immunity. Analyses of cytotoxic activities of spleen cells with 51Cr release assays revealed that Sendai virus-specific T lymphocytes (CTL), in addition to natural killer activity and antiviral antibodies, were induced in DBA/2 and C3H/He mice infected intranasally with TR-2. Proteolytic activation of the fusion glycoprotein F was required for the primary induction of CTL, though not necessarily for stimulation of natural killer and antibody responses. Memory of the CTL induced by TR-2 was long-lasting and was recalled in vivo immediately after challenge with wild-type Sendai virus. In contrast to TR-2, immunization with inactive split vaccine failed to induce the CTL response, but it elicited a high titer of serum antibody and a low level of natural killer activity."	0

"T cell subsets responsible for clearance of Sendai virus from mouse lungs determined by adoptive transfer of immune spleen cell fractions to infected nude mice. T cells with antiviral activity developed in spleens by 7 days after intranasal infection. Spleen cell fractions depleted of Lyt-2+, Lyt-1+, or L3T4+ cells showed antiviral activity in vivo, although the degree of the activity was lower than that of control whole spleen cells. The antiviral activity of the Lyt-2+ cell-depleted fraction was consistently higher than that of L3T4+ (Lyt-1+)-depleted cells. In vitro cytotoxic activity against Sendai virus-associated, syngeneic lipopolysaccharide-blast cells was detected in stimulated cells from intraperitoneally immunized mice but was lost after depletion of Lyt-2+ cells. Multiple injection of anti-Sendai virus antibody into infected nude mice had no effect on lung virus titer. These results indicate that L3T4+ (Lyt-1+) and Lyt-2+ subsets are cooperatively responsible for efficient clearance of Sendai virus from the mouse lung."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	2907092	Depression of T cell-mediated immunity and enhancement of autoantibody production by natural infection with microorganisms in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).	"We studied the effects of breeding conditions on the development of immunological abnormalities in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with congenital T cell depression. The depression of T cell functions, the production of natural thymocytotoxic autoantibody (NTA), and the development of polyarteritis nodosa were more evident in SHR reared under a conventional (CV) environment than in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) SHR bred in a semi-barrier system. Enhancement of these immunologic abnormalities was also observed by the conventionalization of SPF-SHR. A high frequency of antibodies to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Sendai virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis was detected in CV rat sera, whereas no antibodies were detected in SPF-SHR. The experimental infection of Sendai virus induced the enhancement of T cell depression and of NTA production in SPF-SHR. We interpret these results to mean that the natural infection of microorganisms causes an acceleration of immunologic abnormalities in SHR reared in a CV environment."	0

"A trypsin-resistant mutant of Sendai virus, TR-2, which could be activated by chymotrypsin but not by trypsin or the protease present in mouse lung, was inoculated intranasally into mice after being activated in vitro. TR-2 hardly brought about clinical illness or lung lesions in mice; the protease present in the lung could not activate the progeny virus, and the infection terminated after one-step replication. Nevertheless, the immunoglobulin A antibody against wild-type Sendai virus was produced in the respiratory tracts as well as the serum immunoglobulin G antibody, and the mice were protected from the challenge of the wild-type Sendai virus. On the basis of these results, TR-2 may provide a new model of live vaccine for paramyxoviruses; its availability as a live vaccine is also discussed."	0

In vivo cocultivation of para-influenza type 1 (Sendai) virus and of Rous sarcoma virus (Schmidt-Ruppin strain) in mouse Ehrlich ascites carcinoma.	"Co-infection of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC)-bearing mice with Sendai virus and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) did not result in the formation of complete RSV. Sendai virus could be, however, propagated in this system over 8 serial passages. As demonstrated by immunofluorescence and complement fixation reactions, antigens specific to each virus were synthesized in EAC cells following either single or mixed virus infection. The virus progens also contained antigenic fractions incorporated from the host cell. The incomplete progens synthesized when RSV inoculation preceded that of Sendai virus possessed three polypeptide fractions characteristic of Sendai virus and one RSV-specific fraction."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	2994598	The effects of monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein on the release of Sendai virus from infected cells.	"Vero cell cultures in Leighton tubes were infected with egg-grown Sendai virus at high multiplicity of infection. Four hours after infection, the cultures were labelled with 35S-methionine, after which various concentrations of fourteen and five mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against different antigenic determinants of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) protein, respectively, were added to the medium. Fourty-eight hours after infection radiolabelled virions released into the medium were collected and purified by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugations. The amount of virus-bound radioactivity obtained in the various extracellular materials allowed an estimation of the capacity of the different monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the release of Sendai virus. In addition, the release of virions from infected cells was studied ultrastructurally. Based on their serological reactivity the fourteen anti-HN monoclonal antibodies could be divided into four groups. The first group of clones could not inhibit any biological activity of the virus. These clones were binding proximally, near the base of the HN glycoprotein and could not inhibit the release of the virus. The second group blocked hemolysis, but did not block hemagglutination (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) activity. The third group of clones blocked all biological activities of the HN glycoprotein. The fourth group could only block NA activity. With the exception of one of five monoclonal antibodies belonging to the second group, antibodies of the second, third and fourth group were found to bind more distally on the HN glycoprotein. Except for two monoclonal antibodies of the second group they could all effectively inhibit release of the virus from infected cells. Ultrastructurally, these antibodies caused aggregation of virions in contact with the plasma membrane. The five monoclonal antibodies directed against the F protein reacted with four different antigenic sites. These antibodies could not prevent the release of Sendai virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	3028822	Induction of H-2-specific antibodies by injections of syngeneic Sendai virus-coated cells.	"The capacity of the B cell immunoglobulin receptor to recognize complexes of Sendai viral and H-2b antigens was investigated by studying the antibody response to injections of syngeneic Sendai virus-coated (SV+) spleen cells in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Almost all mice produced alloreactive anti-H2 lymphocytotoxic antibodies. In contrast, such antibodies were found very exceptionally in mice injected with normal (SV-) cells or with Sendai virus (SV) only. The reaction pattern of the cytotoxic antibodies induced was variable and ranged from almost anti-private to widely cross-reactive serotypes. The results of reactions on H-2-congenic, -recombinant and -mutant mouse strains, and of capping and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the cytotoxic antibodies were directed against H-2 class I molecules. The anti-H-2 antibodies exhibited enhanced binding for SV+ target cells, but absorption experiments showed that this was not the result of cross-reactions with cell surface Sendai viral determinants or with a molecular complex of H-2 plus SV. This conclusion was supported by the observation that syngeneic SV+ cells were not the predominant targets for the induced lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Our results do not support the existence of MHC-restricted antiviral antibodies, but show the induction of anti-class I H-2 alloantibodies by injections with syngeneic SV-coated cells. We present a model for regular induction of anti-H-2 antibodies without intentional alloimmunization."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	4128377	Effects of polyadenylic acids on functions of murine RNA tumor viruses.	"Single-stranded polyribonucleotides, which competitively inhibit murine RNA tumor virus reverse transcriptase in vitro, were tested as inhibitors of various virus functions in cell culture. The compounds had two concentration-dependent effects. At high concentrations (100 mug/ml), both poly(adenylic acid) [poly(A)] and poly(2'-O-methyladenylic acid) [poly(Am)] inhibited the uptake of radioactively labeled leukemia virus by Swiss mouse embryo cells, but neither had a similar effect on Sindbis virus adsorption. At low concentrations (10 mug/ml), poly(Am) did not inhibit the uptake of leukemia virus but did inhibit virus replication by 85%; in contrast, the replication of Sendai virus and Sindbis virus was not inhibited significantly at this concentration. Both compounds were effective only when added prior to or early during virus infection. Poly(Am) was a much more effective inhibitor than poly(A), probably due to the nuclease resistance of the former compound. Poly(Am) at 5 mug/ml also inhibited transformation of 3T3 cells by Moloney sarcoma virus. However, neither poly(A) nor poly(Am) at high concentrations inhibited the activation of endogenous leukemia virus by iododeoxyuridine in AKR mouse embryo cells. These results suggest that virus reverse transcriptase plays an essential role in both the replication of exogenous murine leukemia viruses and the transformation of cells by murine sarcoma viruses but probably has no role in the activation of endogenous leukemia virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	4347422	Transformation of rat liver cells with chicken sarcoma virus B77 and murine sarcoma virus.	"Rat liver cells in vitro were transformed with chicken sarcoma virus B77, giving RL(B77) cells, and with murine sarcoma virus (Harvey), giving RL(MSV) cells. Rat liver cells transformed spontaneously in vitro were designated RL cells. In addition, the RL(MSV) cell line was adapted for growth in culture fluid containing 25 mug of 5-bromodeoxyuridine per ml. All cell lines were tumorigenic in 1-wk-old rats. The number of cells needed for induction of tumor growth was 1,000-fold higher in the case of RL(B77) cells in comparison with RL(MSV) cells and RL cells. No production of viral particles from any of the cell lines investigated was detected by plating concentrated supernatant fluid of the cultures on different secondary embryo cells with and without fusion by Sendai virus, by labeling with uridine-5-(3)H, or by assay for deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity. The viral genome was rescued by fusion of RL(B77) cells with chicken cells. Chicken sarcoma virus rescued from (RL(B77) cells differed in plating efficiency on duck cells from B77 virus rescued from transformed rat embryo cells. No virus was rescued after fusion of RL(MSV) and RL cells with mouse, rat, or chicken embryo cells. Infectious murine sarcoma virus can be induced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine from RL(MSV) cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	6296260	A method for obtaining chimaeric mouse blastocysts with two separate inner cell masses: a preliminary report.	"Pairs of zona-free mouse blastocysts aggregated in the presence of inactivated Sendai virus and subsequently cultured in vitro will fuse to form a chimaeric blastocyst with one common blastocoelic cavity. Depending on the relative position of the inner cell masses in the apposed 'parental' blastocysts, the resulting chimaeric blastocyst contains either a single inner cell mass (ICM) of dual origin or two discrete ICMs each originating from one embryo. In the present experiments, fusion between the two aggregated blastocysts occurred in 23% of the pairs and 64% of these chimaeric blastocysts contained two ICMs. Blastocysts of the latter type could potentially give rise to pairs of embryos which as regards the topography of the foetal membrane would resemble spontaneous identical twins, although they would be genetically dissimilar. Possible applications of the described method are discussed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	6299951	Pneumotropism of Sendai virus in relation to protease-mediated activation in mouse lungs.	"The pneumotropism of Sendai virus in mice was studied in relation to the activation and replication of the virus in the lung. Inactive Sendai virus grown in LLC-MK(2) cells, which possessed an uncleaved precursor glycoprotein, F, and was noninfectious to tissue culture cells, neither grew nor caused pathological changes in the lung of mice. When trypsin treatment was made which cleaved F into F(1) and F(2) subunits, the virus became activated so that it could initiate replication in the bronchial epithelium of the lung. In this case, the progeny virus was produced in the activated form and multiple-cycle replication occurred successively. A parallel relationship was found between the degree of the viral replication and that of clinical signs of the respiratory disease, body weight loss, and histopathological changes in the lung. A protease mutant, TR-2, which was able to be activated only by chymotrypsin but not by trypsin, could also initiate replication in the bronchial epithelium, when activated by chymotrypsin before inoculation into mice. The progeny virus, however, remained inactive, and the replication was limited to a single cycle, which resulted in the limited lung lesion. The overall results suggest that some activating mechanism for the progeny virus of wild-type Sendai virus exists in the lung of mice and the principle (activator) responsible for this phenomenon has a character similar to trypsin. The possible location of the activator is discussed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	7730810	Parainfluenza virus type 1 infects olfactory neurons and establishes long-term persistence in the nerve tissue.	"A mouse model of Sendai virus infection was adopted to examine the in vivo neurovirulence of parainfluenza viruses. A nested polymerase chain reaction detected the Sendai virus nucleoprotein gene in the olfactory bulbs of intranasally infected mice for at least 168 days post-infection (p.i.) and virus-specific messenger RNAs for 28 days p.i. Viral proteins were histochemically detected in some olfactory neurons for 7 days p.i. They were also found in glomeruli of the olfactory bulbs but not in the mitral cells and the tufted cells. No virus was detected in the whole brain not including the olfactory bulbs. When mice were inoculated with UV-inactivated virus, the viral RNA was present in the olfactory bulbs for a short period of 14 days, with no demonstrable viraemia. These results demonstrate that the parainfluenza virus directly accesses the central nervous system via olfactory neurons and establishes long-term persistence in the nerve tissue."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	7865469	The MHC class I-restricted T cell response to Sendai virus infection in C57BL/6 mice: a single immunodominant epitope elicits an extremely diverse repertoire of T cells.	"We have used Sendai virus infection of C57BL/6 mice as a model with which to study the T cell response to a single MHC class I epitope. Cells taken from the bronchoalveolar lavage or restimulated in vitro from the mediastinal lymph nodes of virus-infected mice were strongly cytotoxic for a single nucleoprotein epitope, NP324-332/Kb. To correlate TCR usage with specificity for the immunodominant epitope, we generated T cell hybridomas from the bronchoalveolar lavage and mediastinal lymph node cells of C57BL/6 mice at the peak of infection. Altogether, 20 hybridomas were identified that specifically secreted IL-2 in response to NP324-332-pulsed L929-Kb cells. TCR usage in this panel of hybridomas was extremely diverse. Over half of the available J beta and V beta elements present in the C57BL/6 strain of mouse were represented in the hybridomas. Similarly, V alpha usage was also diverse and all 12 of the alpha chains sequenced used distinct J alpha elements. The only relatively conserved feature of the TCR in these hybridomas was the presence of an arginine residue in the junctions of 70% of the beta chains. These data demonstrate that a diverse repertoire of TCR is able to recognize a single MHC class I epitope. Moreover, the data demonstrate that mice make use of this potential diversity in the primary response to a natural viral infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	human respirovirus 1	8386739	Modulation of experimental hypersensitivity pneumonitis by Sendai virus.	"To evaluate the potential role of viruses in the pathogenesis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), we looked at the effect of challenging normal versus Sendai-injected mice with Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula (SR). In this model of HP, mice are nasally instilled with SR antigen three consecutive days per week of study. For this study virus was given after 3 weeks of SR. Two positive (SR alone, virus alone) and a negative (saline) control groups were done in parallel with the viral plus SR group. Lung response to these different conditions was evaluated by lung index, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell populations, lung histopathology, and BAL fluid fibronectin levels. SR challenge resulted in an increase in BAL cells, lung index, and BAL fibronectin levels and in a peribronchial inflammatory reaction. The virus alone produced a transient increase in BAL cells. The cellular response to SR, in virus-injected animals, was greater than the added effects of the virus and SR. Virus alone had no persistent effect on the other measured parameters and did not change the effect of SR on these variables. We conclude that the Sendai virus enhances the cellular response of the mouse lungs to an SR antigenic challenge."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	langat virus	2859760	Virus-induced decrease in the activity of serum blocking factor(s): a mechanism of activation of the autoreactive T effectors in graft versus host reaction and of controlling T suppressors.	"It has been shown that serum blocking factor(s) (SBF) previously detected in normal mice bind(s) to receptors on the surface membranes of virus-induced autoreactive T lymphocytes (ARTL) and to that of ARTL activity inhibiting T suppressors (TSar). The interaction of SBF with the receptors is reversible, H-2 restricted and associated with the inhibition of functional activity of the tested T lymphocyte populations. In mice during acute tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), in the course of inapparent infections induced by Langat virus or dengue type 2 (D2) and after infection with the attenuated yellow fever virus (strain 17D), the SBF activity significantly decreased, while ARTL and TSar became activated. Administration of normal mouse serum to infected animals with SBF deficiency resulted in inhibition of both inductive and productive phases of ARTL and TSar formations. Based on these findings, the virus-induced decrease in SBF activity may be considered as one of the mechanisms triggering autoimmune responses. The autoreactive pathological states can develop under various endo-and/or exogenic conditions influencing on SBF and on the TSar activity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	langat virus	11485400	Infection with Langat Flavivirus or expression of the envelope protein induces apoptotic cell death.	"Langat (LGT) flavivirus, derived from infectious full-length cDNA clone 636, was investigated for its apoptotic activities in mouse neuroblastoma (Neuro-2a) and simian kidney (Vero and LLC-MK(2)) cells. The hallmark of apoptosis, cleavage of cellular DNA, was observed 48 h after infection of Vero, LLC-MK(2), and Neuro-2a cells by electrophoresis analysis. Apoptosis in infected cells was also confirmed by TUNEL assay. LGT-infected Neuro-2a cells showed an increase in caspase-3-like protease (DEVDase) activity. Expression of the major envelope glycoprotein (E) alone reduced cell viability in both Vero and Neuro-2a cells, and the baculovirus P35 protein, which inhibits multiple caspases, completely blocked this effect. Cleavage of cellular DNA was observed in E gene-transfected Vero cells by TUNEL assay. Expression of E protein or caspase-9 resulted in activation of caspase-3-like proteases in Neuro-2a cells. The caspase-3-like protease specific inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO peptide, partially inhibited E protein- or caspase-9-induced apoptosis in Neuro-2a cells. These observations indicate that infection of cells with LGT virus or expression of LGT virus E protein induces apoptosis through a caspase-3-like protease pathway."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	541676	The immune response of the mouse to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. I. Circulating antibodies.	"A search was made in LCM virus-immune mice for virus-specific antibodies. With the help of an L-cell plaque assay, neutralizing antibody was readily detected. There were no essential differences between mouse strains, but marked differences existed between virus strains. Whereas the inoculation of either large or small doses of WE strain virus led to the early production of considerable concentrations of neutralizing antibody, in the case of E-350 strain virus, high doses were required and a much longer time interval had to elapse before the threshold of detection was attained. In addition to neutralizing antibody, LCM virus-infected mice produced sensitizing antibody (detected by the enhancing effect of an anti-mouse Ig antiserum on the ability of a serum to reduce virus infectivity) and complement-fixing antibody. Previous failures to detect neutralizing antibody in LCM virus-immune mice might have been caused by properties of the chosen virus, but in many instances lack of a suitable assay host is a more likely explanation."	0

"Infection of mice with strain No. 325 of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM) isolated in Moscow was of two types depending on the age of the animals at the time of inoculation. Infection in adult mice terminated either in death or recovery with development of immunity. Inoculation of suckling mice resulted in formation of chronic virus carrier state in most survivors.

mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1082923	Virus and trinitrophenol hapten-specific T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity against H-2 incompatible target cells.	"Immune spleen cells from LCM virus-infected (CBA X C57BL/6)F1 radiation chimeras entirely repopulated with CBA-T6 lymphocytes were cytotoxic for allogeneic, LCM virus infected C57BL/6 mouse-derived target cells. Normal C57BL/6 targets were not lysed. CBA-T6 lymphocytes derived from (CBA X C57BL/6) radiation chimeras sensitized in vitro against TNP-conjugated C57BL/6 spleen cells lysed TNP-conjugated C57BL/6 targets. However normal C57BL/6 mouse-derived targets were not destroyed. The magnitude of virus-specific (or TNP-specific) cytotoxic responses against H-2 incompatible targets was lower compared to that against H-2 compatible targets. These data are considered to support and to extend the altered self concept, but are not consistent with the dual recognition concept."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1085205	LCM virus infection of cells in vitro.	"Most mammalian cells cultivated in vitro can be infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. In addition to infectious virus, the cells produce antigenic material that fixes complement in the presence of antibody and is precipitated by antiserum. Intracellular antigen can also be demonstrated by the immunofluorescence procedure. When infected cells are viewed with the electron microscope, viral structures are seen either budding from or in association with the cell membranes. Immunoelectron microscopy, immunofluorescence, and cytotoxicity tests reveal virus-specific antigens on the surface of intact cells. Virus multiplication may be succeeded by cytolysis. Two LCM virus-specific antigens (or antigenic groups) can at present be distinguished. One corresponds to the infectious virus; the other is the complement-fixing \"soluble\" antigen. This extractable complement-fixing activity is produced by infected cells and is also a structural component of the infectious virus. It is not represented on the surface of either the virion or the infected cell. The cytolytic potential of LCM virus varies and is dependent on its previous passage history. Cytolytic and \"attenuated\" variants are able to initiate persistent infection of Mus musculus.Together with infectious virus, particles are produced that temporarily protect cells against standard virus. They appear to be by-products of virus multiplication, not in the sense of deletion mutants but of virus structures insufficiently equipped for their own active or passive replication, though capable of interfering with infectious virus. No evidence has been found for the generation of \"defective interfering\" particles, though their presence has not yet been excluded."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1100673	Comparison of three tests for the serological diagnosis of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection.	"Levels of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus antibody were assayed in 62 infected persons. The three tests used were indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), complement fixation, and neutralization in mice. The sera first became positive by the IFA test, and IFA titers rapidly rose to a relatively high level, with the sera remaining positive long after the antibody detectable by complement fixation had disappeared. The IFA test appeared to be specific. The sera became positive last by the mouse neutralization test; with this test, antibody first appeared several weeks after infection. Virus-infected cells were stable when stored at -60 C, allowing diagnostic sera to be tested promptly by the IFA test. The IFA test for lymphocytic choriomeningitis antibody should increase the number of serological diagnoses, since it is not only rapid and specific, but detects cases not diagnosed by the other methods."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1315368	Correlation between cyclophosphamide-induced viral susceptibility and depletion of Junin virus-induced suppressor populations.	"In contrast to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, another arenavirus, Junin virus (JV), the etiologic agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, when inoculated into suckling mice, induces lethal meningoencephalitis characterized by a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like immune response. However, the adult BALB/c mouse is resistant to infection and no DTH reaction can be seen. This different viral sensitivity may be related to the development of an antigen non-specific DTH-suppressor cell pathway at work in the adult mouse. When the resistant mice are treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy) (50 mg/kg each dose) given at days -1,+1,+4 (zero: infection day), animals become susceptible and develop DTH reaction in brain that leads to death. We analyze the influence of the timing of Cy administration on the suppressor system developing after infection. It was found that Cy depletes the previously described JV-induced suppressor populations (Tsv) but a new suppressor cell (Tsv*) is disclosed bearing the Thy 1+ Ly1+2- phenotype which is unable to depress DTH in Cy-treated animals. With only two doses of Cy corresponding to days -1 and +1, the target of Tsv* cells is depleted but the third dose is still required to achieve full depletion of Tsv cells which are able to employ the Cy-resistant antigen-specific suppressor cells as targets. Since the Cy treatment is able to deplete the Tsv population together with the target of Tsv* cells, animals became unable to regulate lethal DTH reaction. Thus, a cellular explanation for an empirically established Cy schedule able to abrogate the adult mouse resistance to JV is proposed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1376367	Mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection: mother-to-baby transfer of humoral protection.	"The role of antiviral antibodies in resistance to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection was explored. Immune serum and monoclonal antibodies prevented fatal T-cell-mediated immunopathology following acute LCMV infections. In addition, 10- and 14-day-old mice that received maternally derived anti-LCMV antibodies through nursing were protected from an otherwise lethal LCMV challenge. Detailed investigation of the mechanism(s) by which these antiviral antibodies provided was carried out by using anti-LCMV monoclonal antibodies. Protection correlated directly with the ability of the antibodies to reduce viral titers in the tissues of conventional (K. E. Wright and M. J. Buchmeier, J. Virol. 65:3001-3006, 1991) and nude mice. However, this reduction was not simply a reflection of virus neutralizing activity, since not all antibodies which neutralized in vitro were protective. A correlation was also found between immunoglobulin isotype and protection: all of the protective antibodies were immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a), while IgG1 antibodies mapping to the same epitopes were not. Protection appeared to be associated with events controlled by the Fc region. Functional F(ab')2 fragments which retained in vitro neutralizing activity were not protective in vivo. Furthermore, this Fc-associated function was not related to complement-mediated cell lysis, since C5-deficient mouse strains were also protected. These results suggest a role for antibody in protection from arenavirus infections and indicate that a distinct immunoglobulin subclass, IgG2a, may be essential for this protection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1385522	Control of acute infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice that cannot present an immunodominant viral cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitope.	"For controlling infection of the mouse with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, CD8+ CTL are essential. In the infected BALB/c mouse the arising LCM virus-specific CTL are exclusively restricted by the class I MHC-encoded molecule L; K- or D-restricted antiviral CTL cannot be detected. Thus, the infected L-deficient BALB/c mutant C-H-2dm2 should not be capable of eliminating the virus. The experimental evidence proves the contrary, which is explained by K- and D-restricted CTL that this mouse generates. Why such cells remain undetectable in BALB/c mice is currently unexplained, because there is no lack of precursors and the corresponding virus Ag is presented. Despite the absence of lytic activity in vitro, other than the one associated with L, transfusion of day 8-immune spleen cells from BALB/c into infected C-H-2dm2 (L-deficient) mice results in accelerated virus elimination from the organs of the latter, which was manifest as soon as 8 h after cell transfer. Furthermore, lytic activity did not attain measurable levels in the recipients' spleens. Obviously, this infection can be terminated by CD8+ T lymphocytes even when these cells' lytic activity is below detectability."	0

"Induction in vivo of antiviral cytotoxic T cell response was achieved in a MHC class I-dependent fashion by immunizing mice three times with a free unmodified 15-mer peptide derived from the nucleoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in IFA. The effector T cells are CD8+, restricted to the class I Ld allele of the analyzed mouse strain, and are specific both at the level of secondary restimulation in vitro and at the effector T cell level. These results suggest that cocktails of viral peptides may be used as antiviral T cell vaccines."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1740856	Lymphocytic choriomeningitis outbreak associated with nude mice in a research institute.	"After an employee at a cancer research institute was diagnosed with lymphocytic choriomeningitis, an investigation was performed to determine the extent of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections among the institute's employees and to identify risk factors for infection., Retrospective cohort study., A US cancer research institute., Eighty-two of 90 institute employees., Serum LCMV antibodies., Seven workers (9%) with definite LCMV infection (LCMV IgG antibody titer greater than or equal to 16) and one worker (1%) with probable infection (IgG titer = 8) were identified (10% overall seroprevalence). All infected employees handled animals or animal tissues and were more likely than other animal handlers to have worked with nude mice (Mus musculus) (P less than .02). Among the 31 employees who worked with nude mice at the institute, infected workers were more likely to clean the cages of nude mice (P much less than .001), change their bedding (P less than .01), and change their water (P less than .001). The institute had been injecting nude mice with LCMV-infected tumor cell lines and had recently increased the nude mouse population and the duration of experiments. These changes would have increased the LCMV burden at the facility and were temporally associated with the cluster of LCMV infections in employees., This LCMV outbreak, the first reported since 1974, is the first associated with nude mice. It illustrates the ongoing hazard LCMV poses in research laboratories. Since the symptoms of LCMV infection can be nonspecific, clinicians should consider this diagnosis in ill patients who report laboratory rodent exposure."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1891717	Viral persistence in neurons explained by lack of major histocompatibility class I expression.	"Viruses frequently persist in neurons, suggesting that these cells can evade immune surveillance. In a mouse model, 5 x 10(6) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), did not lyse infected neurons or cause immunopathologic injury. In contrast, intracerebral injection of less than 10(3) CTL caused disease and death when viral antigens were expressed on leptomeningeal and choroid plexus cells of the nervous system. The neuronal cell line OBL21 expresses little or no major histocompatibility (MHC) class I surface glycoproteins and when infected with LCMV, resisted lysis by virus-specific CTLs. Expression of MHC heavy chain messenger RNA was limited, but beta 2-microglobulin messenger RNA and protein was made normally. OBL21 cells were made sensitive to CTL lysis by transfection with a fusion gene encoding another MHC class I molecule. Hence, neuronal cells probably evade immune surveillance by failing to express MHC class I molecules."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	1919008	Antiviral immune responses of fully allogeneic irradiation bone marrow mouse chimeras.	"In (B10.BR----B10) chimeras infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus higher titers were attained in spleens and livers than in organs of the mice used for their construction, and the subsequent elimination was retarded, but eventually the virus was cleared. The numbers of LCM virus-specific CTL and their precursors as quantitated with chromium-release assay and limiting dilution method, respectively, were lower in chimeras than in B10.BR or C57BL/10J mice, and fewer were restricted for the haplotypes of the donors than of the recipients. The same was true with regard to antiviral effector cells, which were determined by adoptive immunization. The numbers of spleen cells releasing IgM and IgG antiviral antibodies were virtually as high in chimeras as they were in C57BL/10J and B10.BR mice. Transfer of immune splenocytes from either B10.BR or C57BL/10J mice resulted in incomplete virus elimination from the spleens of infected chimeras, whereas injection of a mixture of the two types of immune cells led to efficient clearance. We conclude that in the chimeras cells of both donor and recipient haplotypes participate in the infection, which is terminated by H-2k- and H-2b-restricted T lymphocytes that these animals are capable of generating. We conclude, furthermore, that clearance of the LCM virus from the tissues requires contact between effector and target cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	2439638	Monoclonal antibodies against viral determinants are not restricted to the K/D end of the major histocompatibility complex.	"Monoclonal antibodies against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a natural, high-replicating, noncytolytic pathogen in mice, were obtained from fusions between myeloma cells and lymphoid cells of mice of different H-2 haplotypes at various times (4-24 d) after infection. Supernatants from growing hybridomas were tested in a RIA, and approximately 15% of all supernatants were positive when tested for specificity on infected vs. uninfected cells of different haplotypes. Upon retesting for specific fluorescence, only some RIA+ supernatants exhibited specific surface staining of acetone-fixed infected cells or unfixed infected cells. In all these experiments and using various detection methods we could not find antibodies with any preference of recognition of viral antigen in conjunction with the H-2 haplotype of the responder mouse. The absence of H-2 restricted antibodies after a primary virus infection in vivo, whether assayed by RIA or surface immunofluorescence, suggests that antibodies obtained in other experiments using infected tumor cells for induction and in the RIA may not represent the general case."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	2452517	Fine mapping of a peptide sequence containing an antigenic site conserved among arenaviruses.	"The lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) structural glycoproteins GP-1 (Mr 44K) and GP-2 (Mr 35K) are encoded on a single intracellular proteolytic cleavage precursor glycoprotein, GP-C (Mr 76K). We have used a series of synthetic peptides derived from the deduced amino acid sequence of LCMV GP-C to define an antigenic site containing two topographically overlapping epitopes. Three mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against two epitopes on GP-2 were assayed for binding in solution phase blocking and solid-phase enzyme-linked immunoadsorbant assays to a series of peptides representing the sequence of the intracellular precursor glycopeptide GP-C. Both epitopes were initially localized to a single peptide GP-C 370-382 (Cys-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Lys-Phe-Trp-Tyr-Leu-Glu-His-Ala-Lys) in the GP-2 segment of GP-C. Further analysis demonstrated that both epitopes were contained within a nine amino acid segment, GP-C 370-378, which contains five residues conserved among LCMV, Lassa, Pichinde, and Tacaribe viruses. Assays with N-terminal deletions from this sequence suggested that the minimal epitope recognized by the broadly cross-reactive monoclonal 33.6 (epitope GP-2a) consisted of five amino acids, GP-C 374-378 (Lys-Phe-Trp-Tyr-Leu). Reactivity of a second monoclonal, 9-7.9 (epitope GP-2B) but not 33.6, was abolished when substitution of tyrosine for phenylalanine was made at position 375 in the antigenic sequence corresponding to a naturally occurring sequence difference between LCM and Lassa viruses. Polyclonal sera from human cases and from animals experimentally infected with Junin, LCM, and Lassa viruses, respectively, bound to the antigenic peptide GP-C 370-382 but not to control peptides. As was the case with the monoclonals, this binding activity was abrogated by blocking with the antigenic peptide but not with control peptides in solution."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	2537363	Virus-induced polyclonal cytotoxic T lymphocyte stimulation.	"Infections with a variety of viruses (lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus, Pichinde virus, vaccinia virus) stimulated C57BL/6 mice to generate allospecific CTL coincidental with the generation of virus-specific CTL. In C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice, LCMV-induced CTL with reactivity against cells from mice bearing gene products of the d, f, k, p, q, and s but not the b MHC loci. Studies with congenic mouse strains indicated that the MHC loci coded for the target of the allospecific killer cells. The targets of the allospecific CTL were further identified as class I MHC Ag by three criteria: 1) target cells from congenic strains of mice differing from effector cells only in the expression of class I Ag were sensitive to lysis; 2) fibroblasts expressing low levels of class I Ag were resistant to lysis but were rendered sensitive after treatment with IFN-beta, which induced higher expression of class I Ag; and 3) antibody specific for class I Ag expressed on the target cell blocked killing. Studies with congenic mouse strains also suggested that the ability to generate high levels of the virus-induced allospecific killer cells was also under MHC regulation, as H-2b mice generated high levels and H-2k mice low levels of the allospecific CTL. Both C3H/St and C57BL/6 mice immunized against LCMV developed detectable LCMV-specific CTL when later challenged with either murine cytomegalovirus, Pichinde virus, or vaccinia virus, indicating that a virus infection can stimulate the reappearance of memory CTL. Cold target competition studies indicated no cross-reactivities between these viruses or allogeneic cells at the CTL level. Both the allospecific CTL and the reactivated LCMV-specific CTL were found in blast-size lymphocyte preparations. Spleen cells taken from LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice 5 days post-infection spontaneously generated into allospecific and virus-specific CTL after 2 days of culture. The generation of both was dependent on the presence of supernatant factors produced only in the presence of L3T4+ cells. These factors activated allospecific CTL in spleen cells from virus-primed mice but not from control mice. We suggest that lymphokines produced as a consequence of virus infection may act to stimulate the proliferation and activation of CTL not specific to the challenge virus, resulting in a virus-induced polyclonal CTL stimulation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	2784104	Expression of cytoplasmic granules with T cell-associated serine proteinase-1 activity in Ly-2+(CD8+) T lymphocytes responding to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in vivo.	"Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) with specificity for the T cell-associated serine proteinase-1 of the mouse (MTSP-1) were used to study expression and storage of this enzyme in T lymphocytes during lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus infection in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of splenic tissue at the peak of LCM virus-specific T cell-mediated cytolytic responses, i.e., at day 7 post infection, revealed high numbers of MTSP-1+ T lymphocytes in the interfollicular T cell-dependent area of the spleen. More than 50% of Ly-2+(CD8+) cells but only low numbers of Ly-2-(CD8-) cells, previously enriched by flow cytofluorometry, contained large amounts of cytoplasmic granules which stained both with MTSP-1-specific mAb and the esterase substrate N-alpha-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine thiobenzyl ester. These data demonstrate that in vivo generated LCM virus-induced cytolytic T lymphocytes develop cytoplasmic storage granules containing MTSP-1 and suggest that the mechanism of granule exocytosis is operative in vivo; possibly MTSP-1 is one effector molecule participating in the Ly-2+(CD8+) T lymphocyte-mediated control of virus infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3027167	Accumulation and chemotaxis of natural killer/large granular lymphocytes at sites of virus replication.	"A model for monitoring the accumulation of natural killer cell/large granular lymphocytes (NK/LGL) at a site of virus replication was studied by using mice infected i.p. with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Pichinde virus, or vaccinia virus. An i.p. but not i.v. infection resulted in a localized increase in NK/LGL cell number (a fourfold to greater than 20-fold increase) and augmentation (a 10- to 20-fold increase) of NK cell activity associated with virus-induced peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. An increase in NK/LGL cell number was detected as early as 12 hr postinfection (p.i.) and peaked at 3 days p.i. with MHV. The initial LGL recruited into the peritoneal cavity at 1 to 3 days p.i. were nonadherent to plastic and were demonstrated to have an NK cell phenotype: asialo GM1+, Thy-1.2 +/-, Lyt-2.2-, and J11d-. The peak number of LGL appeared at 7 days after infection with the NK cell-resistant virus, LCMV. This LGL population had been previously demonstrated to contain cytotoxic T lymphocyte/LGL (CTL/LGL) as well as NK/LGL. During an MHV infection the number of LGL decreased between days 3 and 7 p.i., suggesting that the second wave of CTL/LGL was absent. These findings may explain the absence of a good MHV-CTL model. Virus-induced, activated NK/LGL responded to chemotactic signals by migrating in a unidirectional manner across two 5-microns pore size polycarbonate filters during 7 hr in vitro chemotaxis assays. Wash-out fluid obtained from the peritoneal cavity contained chemotactic activity for NK/LGL as well as for other cell types. We conclude that production and/or release of chemotactic factors at sites of virus replication are at least partially responsible for the accumulation of NK/LGL at these sites."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3258641	Clearance of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in antibody- and B-cell-deprived mice.	"The role of antibody in immune recovery from infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strain WE was evaluated in B-cell-depleted mice. Mice were treated from birth with either affinity-purified rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin M (IgM), normal rabbit immunoglobulin, or, alternatively, an affinity-purified monoclonal rat anti-mouse IgM antibody (LO-MM-9); untreated mice served as controls. B-cell depletion was considered complete in specifically treated mice according to the following criteria: absence of a significant response to the B-cell mitogen lipopolysaccharide, absence of B cells expressing immunoglobulin on their surfaces, absence of detectable IgM or IgG in serum, and presence in the serum of free anti-IgM antibodies. In organs of mu-suppressed BALB/c mice, LCMV-WE replicated, dependent upon organ, at the same rate or more rapidly and, in general, to higher titers than in normal rabbit immunoglobulin-treated mice; untreated mice eliminated the virus most rapidly and showed lower virus titers. In addition, LCMV-primed control mice cleared a second LCMV challenge very rapidly and contained no virus by day 3, whereas mu-suppressed mice had virus in their blood and organs (except the spleen) up to days 3 to 6. The observed effects of anti-mu treatment may reflect the action of neutralizing antibodies (which so far have been difficult to demonstrate in vivo) or other antibody-dependent antiviral mechanisms which, together with T cells, efficiently control LCMV clearance."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3259346	Virus-lymphocyte interactions. IV. Molecular characterization of LCMV Armstrong (CTL+) small genomic segment and that of its variant, Clone 13 (CTL-).	"Immunocompetent adult mice mount a vigorous cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response against the Armstrong (ARM) 53b strain of LCMV after primary inoculation. In contrast, the Clone 13 variant of ARM 53b, originally isolated from the spleen of a persistently infected mouse, suppresses LCMV-specific CTL responses (R. Ahmed et al. (1984) J. Exp Med 60, 521). The induction and generation of CTL maps to the short (S) RNA segment and not the long (L) RNA segment of LCMV (Y. Riviere et al. (1986) J. Immunol. 136, 304). The CTL recognition epitope, expressed in virus-infected target cells, also maps to the S segment of the LCMV ARM genome, and is structurally and functionally intact in Clone 13-infected target cells. Here we report the S RNA sequences of both ARM 53b and its variant Clone 13. Comparison reveals a single amino acid difference. However, sequence divergence at this position also occurs among other strains of LCMV (Pasteur, Traub, WE) which do elicit CTL responses. Hence, (1) the amino acid difference is unrelated to the phenotypic divergence of Clone 13, (2) suppression of the CTL response by Clone 13 is not linked to the CTL recognition epitope, and (3) the structure or function responsible for CTL immunosuppression by Clone 13 most likely maps to the L RNA segment. Further, the availability of the complete S RNA sequence for LCMV ARM and ARM Clone 13 variant allows a detailed comparison with WE (V. Romanowski et al. (1985) Virus Res. 3, 110-114), the only other LCMV S RNA so far sequenced."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3260181	Induction of T cell serine proteinase 1 (TSP-1)-specific mRNA in mouse T lymphocytes.	"An oligonucleotide probe corresponding to nucleotides of a cDNA encoding the T cell-associated proteinase 1 (TSP-1) was chosen to study the induction and expression of TSP-1-specific transcripts in mouse T lymphocytes and tissues. We demonstrate that TSP-1 mRNA is only expressed in activated T lymphocytes and is absent from all mouse tissues tested including those containing resting mature T lymphocytes. Expression of the TSP-1 gene was observed in T lymphocytes in vitro in response to either phorbolester (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate), Ca2+ ionophore (A23187), lectin or alloantigen. In general, TSP-1 mRNA appeared and peaked later compared to interleukin 2 transcripts. Furthermore, TSP-1 mRNA was inducible in vitro in both Ly-2+ and L3T4+ lymphocyte populations treated with alloantigen and/or lectin. The transcription of the TSP-1 gene was always accompanied by the expression of proteinase activity. High expression of TSP-1 transcripts was also observed in in vivo derived T effector cells specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. However, TSP-1 mRNA was predominantly associated with virus-specific Ly-2+ T cells and correlated with their proteinase and cytolytic activities. The data suggest that TSP-1 gene transcription is a useful marker to characterize T effector cells in vitro and in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3261324	Mechanism of recovery from acute virus infection. VI. Replication of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in and clearance from the foot of the mouse.	"The hind foot was chosen for study of the mechanism by which adult mice clear lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. The T cell-mediated swelling that follows the local inoculation of virus allows parallel investigation of the infectious process and delayed-type hypersensitivity in one organ. A dose of 10(5) mouse infectious units (IU) was optimal, and in all mouse strains tested foot swelling commenced 6 days after injection, with maximal response on days 7 and 8. When mice were sensitized by intravenous (i.v.) infection and challenged locally with infectious virus, the extent of swelling depended on both doses of virus and was most extensive when the interval between primary inoculation and local elicitation was 10 days. The rates of replication of the virus and its clearance were similar in the feet of mice of four strains tested, varying with regard to LCM virus-specific cell-mediated immunity. In CBA/J mice, virus elimination from the foot was followed for a longer time period and was incomplete up to 100 days after infection. A protocol for determining adoptive immunization was established; local inoculation of 10(5) IU was followed 22 h later by i.v. infusion of 1 x 10(8) unselected or 4 x 10(7) T cell-enriched cells from the spleens of syngeneic donors that had been infected i.v. 7 or 8 days previously with 10(3) IU. The concentrations of virus in the recipients' feet began to decline 2 to 3 days thereafter. Adoptive immunization by local inoculation of immune spleen cells was less successful, apparently because the virus multiplied in transferred cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3374738	Effects of persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection on cholinergic neurons in the mouse.	"We have examined the effects of persistent infection with the Armstrong E350 strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) on choline acetyltransferase activity in several regions of Balb/c mouse brain. Despite the presence of high titres of virus in brain for as long as 6 months, and a widespread distribution of virus antigen, no decreases in choline acetyltransferase activity could be demonstrated. The enzyme activity was increased in some regions of brain, showing an effect of the persistent virus infection on a differentiated cell function. Although these data do not suggest a role for LCMV in human neurologic disease, similar studies may allow useful animal models to be conveniently and reproducibly generated."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3496657	Different Tc response profiles are associated with survival in the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection.	"The pathogenicity of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) inoculated intracerebrally (i.c.) varies with virus strain and dose as well as with the mouse strain used as host. Recently, results have indicated that susceptibility to lethal disease correlates directly the ability of the host to produce early and high virus-specific Tc activity. However, in the present studies we demonstrate that even though this holds true in many mouse/virus combinations, it does not apply in others. Thus, in C3H mice infected with (moderately) high doses of Traub strain LCMV, early and high Tc activity was found despite a mortality rate of only 10-20%. Similarly, in C3H mice inoculated with the aggressive and docile substrains of UBC strain LCMV, which differ markedly in their pathogenicity for this mouse strain, similar kinetics of Tc induction were observed. Finally, in DBA/2 mice which do not die following infection with the otherwise lethal aggressive substrain, Tc induction could be found to be as efficient as in BALB/c mice, all of which die from acute LCM disease when infected with this virus isolate. The results indicate, therefore, that early and high Tc activity does not constitute a sufficient prerequisite for lethal disease, and that different Tc response profiles may be associated with low mortality following i.c. inoculation with LCMV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	3735489	Mechanisms of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced hemopoietic dysfunction.	"Results of this study showed that lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infection causes a marked activation of natural killer (NK) cells not only in the spleen but also in the bone marrow. This activity reached its peak at about day 3 of infection and declined after days 6 to 7. Enhanced NK cell activity was found to correlate with decreased receptivity for syngeneic stem cells in bone marrow and spleen, with the notable exception that decreased receptivity persisted longer in bone marrow. Treatment of infected recipients with anti-asialo GM1 (ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide) significantly increased the receptivity for syngeneic hemopoietic cells. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that NK cell activation causes rejection of syngeneic stem cells, thus resulting in hemopoietic depression. To understand the mechanisms behind the prolonged decrease in bone marrow receptivity (and bone marrow function in the intact mouse) mentioned above, we followed the changes in the number of pluripotential stem cells (CFU-S) circulating in the peripheral blood and in endogenous spleen colonies in irradiated mice, the limbs of which were partially shielded. It was found that following a marked early decline, both parameters increased to normal or supranormal levels at about day 9 after infection. Because the bone marrow pool of CFU-S is only about 20% of normal at this time after infection, a marked tendency for CFU-S at this stage in the infection to migrate from the bone marrow to the spleen is suggested. It seems, therefore, that as NK cell activity declines, the spleen regains the ability to support growth of hemopoietic cells and the bone marrow resumes an elevated export of stem cells to the spleen. This diversion of hemopoiesis could explain both the long-standing deficiencies of the bone marrow compartment and the prolonged decrease in the receptivity of this organ."	0

"Persistent infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus activates a phenotypic expression of murine leukemia viruis-related antigen. NZB and (NZB x NZW)F(1) mice, which normally carry large amounts of Gross virus, and C57BL/6 and NZW mice, which normally carry little virus, were infected with LCM virus. All had Gross soluble antigen in their plasmas at 3 months of age, while noninfected matched controls of all strains did not. This effect was seen after infection with LCM virus that was tissue passed or plaque purified. Similarly, cultures of mouse-embryo fibroblasts produced Gross soluble antigen when infected with LCM virus, but noninfected cultures failed to do so."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	5154886	Lytic and turbid plaque-type mutants of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus as a cause of neurological disease or persistent infection.	"Mouse-passaged lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus was found to contain a mixture of two different plaque-type mutants when plated on BHK-21/13S cells in agarose suspension. One mutant gave rise to clear plaques, with death of the cells, whereas the other produced turbid plaques which were sometimes very difficult to see. The clear-plaque variant caused a pronounced cytopathic effect on BHK-21 cells, but the turbid variant caused none; it also interfered with the cytopathic effect due to the clear variant. Brain-passed LCM virus was found to consist mainly of the clear-plaque-type, whereas liver-passed virus was mainly turbid-plaque-type. The clear type induced convulsions and early death after intracerebral inoculation of adult mice; the turbid variant caused no convulsions and late deaths. In newborn mice, the clear-plaque-type was uniformly fatal, whereas the turbid variant caused no deaths but instead induced persistent tolerant infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	6092472	The immune response of the mouse to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. IV. Enumeration of antibody-producing cells in spleens during acute and persistent infection.	"The solid-phase immunoenzymatic technique for the enumeration of single rat cells producing antibodies against ovalbumin has been adapted to mouse cells producing antibodies against lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. After intravenous (i.v.) infection with 10(3) infectious units, IgM- and IgG-producing cells appeared on days 4 and 5, respectively. They rose to high numbers on days 7, 8, and 9 and were still detectable on day 38. After a second i.v. inoculation of 10(7) infectious units, antibody-producing cells (APC), most of which made IgG, appeared faster and reached much higher numbers. Mutatis mutandis, very similar results were obtained with mice inoculated with vesicular stomatitis virus. Antibodies were specific as to virus, but probably corresponded to more than one viral antigen. Relatively low numbers of APC were also detected in the spleens of NMRI strain carrier mice, which develop severe immune complex disease in later life, but not in spleens of persistently infected young mice of strains that remain free of late immune complex disease, namely CBA/J, C3H/HeJ, and gray house mice; APC were detected in spleens of aging CBA/J but not gray house mice."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	6157772	Severity of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus disease in different strains of suckling mice correlates with increasing amounts of endogenous interferon.	"A marked difference was observed in the severity of disease in lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus-infected suckling BALB/c, Swiss, and C3H mice. BALB/c mice had minimal liver lesions and none died, whereas C3H mice had extensive liver lesions and all mice died. An intermediate pattern was oberved for Swiss mice (36% mortality). Although there was no difference in the titers of LCM virus in the plasma or liver between these three strains of mice, there was a marked difference in the amount of interferon produced and the duration of interferonemia. C3H mice produced more interferon than Swiss mice which produced more interferon than BALB/c mice, indicating a direct correlation between the amount of interferon induced by LCM virus and the extent of disease. Inoculation of a potent anti-mouse interferon globulin markedly reduced the incidence of mortality in virus-infected C3H mice. BALB/c mice were as sensitive to the effects of interferon as C3H mice because daily administration of potent interferon preparations did induce disease in this strain. This ensemble of results supports our contention that endogenous interferon is in large part responsible for the manifestaions of acute LCM virus disease in suckling mice."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	6165266	Interferon-induced disease in mice and rats.	"Treatment of newborn mice with potent mouse interferon preparations resulted in an acute \"early\" syndrome characterized by inhibition of growth, delay in maturation of several organs, diffuse liver cell necrosis and death. When interferon treatment was discontinued at 1 week of life, mice appeared to recover, but subsequently developed a progressive glomerulonephritis (\"late syndrome\"). Treatment of newborn rats with potent rat interferon preparations also resulted in inhibition of growth, delay in maturation, and the subsequent development of glomerulonephritis. After infection at birth with lymphocyte choriomeningitis (LCM) virus, most strains of mice developed a similar acute early syndrome and surviving mice subsequently developed glomerulonephritis. We postulated that the endogenous interferon induced by LCM virus early in life was partially responsible for these syndromes. Administration of a potent anti-mouse interferon serum to LCM virus-infected mice neutralized the circulating endogenous interferon and inhibited the development of both the early and late syndromes. Our results suggest that large amounts of exogenous or endogenous interferon at a crucial stage of rapid growth or development of mice and rats can induce lesions in several different organs. Some lesions (i.e. the kidney) only become apparent weeks or even months after exposure to interferon."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	7745950	Murine hepatitis caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. II. Cells involved in pathogenesis.	"Human virus hepatitides are often assumed to result from pathogenic immune responses rather than from direct viral cytopathic effects, but the details are largely unknown. Hepatitis of the mouse undergoing infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus is an immunopathologic phenomenon, and its analysis may help us to understand some of the events leading to the human illnesses., Mice were infected with LCM virus and were depleted of T cells or their subsets by inoculation of monoclonal antibodies; other infected mice lacked all T lymphocytes or the CD8+ subset because of genetic defects. Also, mice were infected and transfused with unsorted or CD(4+)-enriched LCM-immune spleen cells. Subsequently, the infectious titers were determined, the cytolytic activities of mononuclear cells isolated from the livers were measured, and the disease process was studied., In LCM virus-infected mice devoid of all T lymphocytes, pathologic alterations remained undetectable. In contrast, immunocompetent animals responded with a severe hepatitis, at the height of which the liver contained large numbers of cytolytic mononuclear leukocytes. Experiments with mice depleted of subset T lymphocytes revealed a predominantly CD8+ T lymphocyte-mediated phase, which was characterized by panlobular inflammation, whereas later there was a periportal inflammatory reaction, in which mainly CD4+ T lymphocytes were involved. Infusion of syngeneic immune spleen cells from immunocompetent donor mice into infected thymus-less mice resulted in virus elimination and damage to liver cells. With a similar protocol and the use of congenic mice, CD8+ T lymphocytes were observed to rapidly enter the recipients' livers, where they were present at the time liver cell injury was apparent. In mice genetically deficient in CD8+ T lymphocytes due to disruption of the gene for beta 2-microglobulin, a somewhat different type of LCM hepatitis developed that was largely dependent on CD4+ T lymphocytes. Liver cells were also damaged in infected nude mice that had been infused with positively selected CD4+ spleen cells from infected +/+ mice., Our findings published previously (Löhler J, Gossmann J, Kratzberg T, Lehmann-Grube F. Lab Invest 1994; 70:263-78) and related here suggest that the hepatitis in mice undergoing infection with LCM virus consists of three consecutive phases, which are mediated predominantly by NK cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, and CD4+ T lymphocytes, respectively. Presumably, other elements of the immune system, such as mononuclear phagocytes and B lymphocytes, contribute to the pathogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	7840852	Involvement of CD4+ cells in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-induced autoimmune anaemia and hypergammaglobulinaemia.	"Development of pathology varies widely between different strains of mice after intracerebral inoculation with the so-called 'docile' isolate of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. The C3HeB/FeJ and B10. Br/SgSnJ mouse strains have been of special interest because they display autoimmune haemolytic anaemia with varying degrees of apparent immunological involvement. In this report, we examined the role of CD4+ T helper cells in this autoimmune response by treating mice with the CD4-specific GK1.5 monoclonal antibody. We also determined if polyclonal activation of B lymphocytes, induced either by LCM virus or by lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus, another well known B cell activator, correlated with the development of anaemia in these mice. Our results strengthened the central role of the immune system in the anaemia in C3H mice by showing that depletion of CD4+ cells largely, if not completely, abrogated this anti-erythrocyte autoimmune reaction. As reported by others, we found that the anaemia was more mild in B10.BR mice than in C3H mice. However, we could not confirm the difference in the degree of B lymphocyte polyclonal activation between these mice. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus had no apparent effect on erythrocytes, even though this virus also induced a sharp increase in plasma IgG levels."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	7889411	How virus induces a rapid or slow onset insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in a transgenic model.	"We developed two distinct transgenic mouse models in which virus induced insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (IDDM). In one of these lines, the unique viral transgene was expressed in the islets of Langerhans and also in the thymus, but in the other line, expression was only in the islets. Insertion and expression of the viral (self) gene, per se, did not lead to IDDM, (incidence < 5%). By contrast, induction of an anti-self (anti-viral) CD8+ CTL response to the same virus later in life caused IDDM (incidence < 90%) in both transgenic lines, although the kinetics and requirements for CD4 help, the affinity and avidity of CD8+ CTL differed in each line. Mice not expressing the viral (self) gene in the thymus developed IDDM 10-14 days after infection. CD4+ T cells played no detectable role, since their depletion failed to alter either the kinetics or incidence of IDDM. By contrast, mice that expressed the viral gene in the thymus required significantly more time to develop IDDM. Their anti-self (viral) CD8+ CTL were of lower affinity and avidity than CD8+ CTL generated by nontransgenic controls. Disease was dependent on T cell help, since deletion of CD4+ cells completely circumvented the IDDM."	0

Evidence for regulation by a gene outside the Igh region.	"The course of systemic infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was studied in BALB/cA and C.B-17 mouse strains differing in the immunoglobulin heavy chain region (Igh). Susceptibility to intracerebral infection and the ability to clear the virus differed significantly between these presumably congenic strains, suggesting that a gene in the Igh region might influence the course of this infection. A difference in virus spread prior to appearance of the immune response could not explain the observed differences. On the other hand, the differences in course of infection correlated with a difference in virus-specific T-cell responsiveness measured in terms of virus-specific cytotoxicity in vitro and delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo. Analysis of F1, BC1 and F2 progeny showed that differential T-cell responsiveness was influenced by a single gene or gene complex; however, no linkage was found between this locus and the Igh-C region. Taken together, these results indicate that an additional, and previously unknown, genetic difference exists between these two mouse strains, and that the involved locus carries a gene which significantly affects T-cell responsiveness to LCMV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	8805633	Selective activation of CD8 T cell effector functions by epitope variants of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein.	"We provide evidence for selective activation of different effector functions of CD8+ T lymphocytes by altered peptide ligands. A T cell epitope from the glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (p33-41) and single amino acid variants thereof were used for primary in vitro induction of CTL clones. When the CTL were analyzed for cytotoxicity, proliferation, IFN-gamma production, and Ca2+ mobilization, we found that some of the clones showed activation of only their cytotoxic effector function when stimulated with variants of their inducing peptides. For one clone, cytotoxic reactivity was readily detected to the inducing peptide and three of four variants, but only the former was also able to trigger proliferation, IFN-gamma production, and Ca2+ mobilization. Another clone also revealed this dichotomy, but in this case some of the altered peptide ligands in addition to the inducing peptide were able to stimulate the full spectrum of effector functions, whereas others only stimulated cytotoxicity. A third clone revealed inefficient triggering of some effector functions by the peptide variants. Our data suggest that, as described for CD4 T cells, altered peptide ligands may lead to partial activation of effector functions of CD8 T cells. In addition, ligands with glycine substitutions in potential TCR contact positions induced CTL, which were able to recognize peptides with a variety of amino acids in the former glycine position."	0

Two different models of acute viral infections have made possible the characterization of a variety of responses to these agents, including natural killer (NK) cell activation and regulation during infection; these are mouse infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The results of our characterization of the NK cell responses elicited in these models and the methods used to dissect the regulation of these responses are reviewed here. Cytotoxicity, proliferation, and cytokine expression assays as well as flow cytometric analyses are used to characterize the in vivo responses. Both of the infections induce early NK cell cytotoxicity and blastogenesis. Infection with MCMV but not LCMV also induces NK cell production of the antiviral cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Antibodies, to mediate in vivo cell subset depletion or cytokine neutralization, and mice, genetically altered to have cell subset or cytokine deficiencies, are utilized to identify the regulatory pathways and mechanisms controlling endogenous NK cell responses to the infections. The major mediators of the regulation of NK cell function during viral infection of normal mice are IFN-alpha/beta and interleukin-12 but not interleukin-2. Furthermore, the induction of later T-cell responses contributes to the negative regulation of NK cells by promoting the production of inhibitory factors including biologically active transforming growth factors-beta. Thus, the study of immune responses to viral infections has provided and will continue to provide important insights into the characteristics of endogenous NK cell responses and the cells and factors that regulate these responses in vivo."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	8823297	Oral insulin treatment suppresses virus-induced antigen-specific destruction of beta cells and prevents autoimmune diabetes in transgenic mice.	"Oral administration of self-antigens has been proposed as a therapy to prevent and treat autoimmune diseases. Here we report that oral treatment with insulin prevents virus-induced insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) in a transgenic (tg) mouse model. Such mice express the viral nucleoprotein (NP) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) under control of the rat insulin promoter in their pancreatic beta cells and < 2% spontaneously develop diabetes. However, 2 mo after challenge with LCMV, IDDM occurs in > 95% of tg mice but not in controls. Oral treatment with 1 mg of insulin twice per week for 2 mo starting either 1 wk before or 10 d after initiating LCMV infection prevents IDDM in > 50% of the tg mice (observation time 8 mo). Thus, insulin therapy is effective in preventing progression to overt IDDM in prediabetic tg mice with ongoing islet infiltration. Oral administration of insulin does not affect the generation of LCMV-NP-specific anti-self cytotoxic T lymphocytes nor the infiltration of lymphocytes into the pancreas. However, less beta cells are destroyed in insulin-treated mice, upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules does not occur, and antiviral (self) cytotoxic T lymphocytes are not found in the islets, events present in tg mice developing IDDM. The majority of lymphocytes in the islets of insulin-treated tg mice without IDDM produces IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta. In contrast, lymphocytes from islets of tg mice developing IDDM mainly make gamma-IFN."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	8892953	T-lymphocyte downregulation after acute viral infection is not dependent on CD95 (Fas) receptor-ligand interactions.	"Infection of mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) causes a major expansion of CD8+ T cells followed by a period of immune downregulation that coincides with the induction of lymphocyte apoptosis in the mouse spleen. CD95 (Fas) and its ligand are important for regulating peripheral T-lymphocyte numbers and can mediate apoptosis of mature T lymphocytes. We infected CD95- and CD95L-deficient mice (lpr and gld, respectively) with LCMV to determine if the immune downregulation that occurred following resolution of the LCMV infection was due to a CD95-dependent apoptotic mechanism. Lymphocytes from LCMV-infected lpr and gld mice were capable of normal T-cell expansion and cytolytic function but were, in contrast to activated cells from normal virus-infected mice, relatively more resistant to T-cell receptor-induced apoptosis in vitro. However, in vivo there were significant numbers of apoptotic cells in the spleens of lpr and gld mice recovering from the infection, and the T-cell number and cytolytic activity decreased to normal postinfection levels. Thus, CD95 is not required for the immune downregulation of the CD8+-T-lymphocyte response following acute LCMV infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	8985412	Antibody prevents the establishment of persistent arenavirus infection in synergy with endogenous T cells.	"A cardinal feature of the biology of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is its ability to establish persistent infections in mice. Persistence is usually established by infection of the mouse during the in utero or neonatal period. Susceptibility can be extended to the adult by treatment with immunosuppressive agents or by infection with immunosuppressive strains of LCMV. In this study we investigated the capacity of passively acquired anti-LCMV antibodies to prevent the establishment of persistence in both neonatal and adult mice. Suckling BALB/c mouse pups nursed by mothers immunized against LCMV before pregnancy had higher survival rates following infection than controls and withstood challenge doses of up to 400 PFU without becoming persistently infected. To establish that maternal antibody alone and not maternally derived T cells provided this protection, nonimmune mothers were infused with monoclonal anti-LCMV neutralizing antibodies within 24 h after delivering their pups. Pups nursing on these passively immunized mothers were resistant to persistent LCMV infection. The establishment of persistence in adult BALB/c mice by the immunosuppressive, macrophage-tropic LCMV variant, clone 13 was also prevented by prophylactic treatment with anti-LCMV monoclonal antibodies. However, the protection afforded by passively acquired antibody was found to be incomplete if the recipients lacked functional CD8+ T cells. While 65% of neonatal athymic (nu/nu) mice nursed by immune nu/+ dams resisted low-dose viral challenge (25 PFU), the majority of nude pups challenged with high doses of virus (100 PFU) became persistently infected. Also, protection was incomplete in beta2-microglobulin knockout mice, which lack functional CD8+ T cells, suggesting that a cooperative effect was exerted by the combination of neutralizing antibody and endogenous T cells. These results indicate that antibodies provide an effective barrier to the establishment of persistent infections in immunocompetent mice and reaffirm that vaccines which induce strong humoral responses may provide efficient protection against arenavirus infections."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	9379009	Altered peptide ligands trigger perforin- rather than Fas-dependent cell lysis.	"CTLs lyse Fas-expressing target cells by the concomitant action of a perforin- and a Fas-dependent mechanism. This study analyzed whether target cells pulsed with T cell antagonists and other altered peptide ligands (APLs) were susceptible selectively to only one of these two mechanisms. In vivo and in vitro activated T cells from transgenic mice expressing a TCR specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus were used as effector cells. To distinguish between perforin- and Fas-dependent cytotoxicity, T cells from normal or perforin-deficient mice were used to lyse peptide-pulsed Fas-positive or Fas-negative target cells. In contrast to previous reports that have shown that APLs selectively induce the Fas-dependent pathway of cytotoxicity, our results demonstrate that target cells pulsed with T cell antagonists and other APLs are lysed predominantly by the perforin-dependent pathway. The contribution of Fas-mediated cytotoxicity was similar for the full agonist and the APLs. Thus, full agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists trigger similar and not distinct pathways of cytotoxicity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	9565631	Induction and exhaustion of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes visualized using soluble tetrameric major histocompatibility complex class I-peptide complexes.	"This study describes the construction of soluble major histocompatibility complexes consisting of the mouse class I molecule, H-2Db, chemically biotinylated beta2 microglobulin and a peptide epitope derived from the glycoprotein (GP; amino acids 33-41) of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). Tetrameric class I complexes, which were produced by mixing the class I complexes with phycoerythrin-labeled neutravidin, permitted direct analysis of virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by flow cytometry. This technique was validated by (a) staining CD8+ cells in the spleens of transgenic mice that express a T cell receptor (TCR) specific for H-2Db in association with peptide GP33-41, and (b) by staining virus-specific CTLs in the cerebrospinal fluid of C57BL/6 (B6) mice that had been infected intracranially with LCMV-DOCILE. Staining of spleen cells isolated from B6 mice revealed that up to 40% of CD8(+) T cells were GP33 tetramer+ during the initial phase of LCMV infection. In contrast, GP33 tetramers did not stain CD8+ T cells isolated from the spleens of B6 mice that had been infected 2 mo previously with LCMV above the background levels found in naive mice. The fate of virus-specific CTLs was analyzed during the acute phase of infection in mice challenged both intracranially and intravenously with a high or low dose of LCMV-DOCILE. The results of the study show that the outcome of infection by LCMV is determined by antigen load alone. Furthermore, the data indicate that deletion of virus-specific CTLs in the presence of excessive antigen is preceded by TCR downregulation and is dependent upon perforin."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	9573228	Evaluation of the Galalpha1-3Gal epitope as a host modification factor eliciting natural humoral immunity to enveloped viruses.	"Human sera contain high levels of natural antibody (Ab) to Galalpha1-3Gal, a terminal glycosidic structure expressed on the surface of cells of mammals other than Old World primates. Incorporation of this determinant onto retroviral membranes by passage of viruses in cells encoding alpha-1-3-galactosyltransferase (GT) renders retroviruses sensitive to lysis by natural Ab and complement in normal human serum (NHS). Plasma membrane-budding viruses representing four additional virus groups were examined for their sensitivities to serum inactivation after passage through human cell lines that lack a functional GT or human cells expressing recombinant porcine GT. The inactivation of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) by NHS directly correlated with host modification of the virus via expression of Galalpha1-3Gal and was blocked by incorporation of soluble Galalpha1-3Gal disaccharide into the inactivation assay. GT-deficient mice immunized to make high levels of Ab to Galalpha1-3Gal (anti-Gal Ab) were tested for resistance to LCMV passaged in GT-expressing cells. Resistance was not observed, but in vitro analyses of the mouse immune sera revealed that the antiviral activity of the sera was insufficient to eliminate LCMV infectivity on its natural targets of infection, macrophages, which express receptors for Ab and complement. Newcastle disease virus and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) were inactivated by NHS regardless of cell passage history, whereas Sindbis virus (SV) passaged in human cells resisted inactivation. Both VSV and SV passaged in Galalpha1-3Gal-expressing human cells incorporated this sugar moiety onto their major envelope glycoproteins. SV passaged in mouse cells expressing Galalpha1-3Gal was moderately sensitive to inactivation by NHS. These results indicate that enveloped viruses expressing Galalpha1-3Gal differ in their sensitivities to NHS and that a potent complement source, such as that in NHS, is required for efficient inactivation of sensitive viruses in vitro and in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	9862665	Virus-activated CD8 T cells and lymphokine-activated NK cells express the mast cell function-associated antigen, an inhibitory C-type lectin.	"The mast cell function-associated Ag (MAFA) is an inhibitory C-type lectin that was originally identified on the cell surface of a rat mucosal mast cell line, RBL-2H3. We have cloned the mouse homologue of the rat MAFA gene, and Northern blot analysis revealed that mouse MAFA (mMAFA) gene expression was strongly induced in effector CD8 T cells and lymphokine-activated NK cells but not in effector CD4 T cells and in mouse mast cells. Moreover, mMAFA gene expression was only found in effector CD8 T cells that had been primed in vivo with live virus because in vitro activated CD8 T cells did not express mMAFA. Primary sequence comparison revealed a high degree of conservation (89% similarity) between rat MAFA and mMAFA. Thus, the MAFA molecule in the mouse is a putative inhibitory receptor on anti-viral CD8 T cells induced in vivo and on NK cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	10231757	Murine viruses in an island population of introduced house mice and endemic short-tailed mice in Western Australia.	"House mice (Mus domesticus) were recently introduced to Thevenard Island, off the northwest coast of Western Australia. This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M. domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. Pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M. domesticus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	10359126	The oncogene product Vav is a crucial regulator of primary cytotoxic T cell responses but has no apparent role in CD28-mediated co-stimulation.	"The guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Vav is a regulator of antigen-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization required for receptor clustering, proliferation and thymic selection. Moreover, Vav has been identified as a major substrate in the CD28 signal transduction pathway and overexpression of Vav enhances TCR-mediated IL-2 secretion in T cells. Here we show that CD3- plus CD28-mediated proliferation and IL-2 production were reduced in vav gene-deficient T cells. However, Vav had no apparent role in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-plus CD28-mediated proliferation and IL-2 production, suggesting that Vav acts downstream of the TCR/CD3 complex. In vivo, Vav expression was crucial to generate primary vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-specific cytotoxic T cell responses. In contrast, vav-/- mice exhibited a reduced but significant footpad swelling after lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infections and mounted a measurable primary cytotoxic T cell response to LCMV. Upon in vitro restimulation, cytotoxic T cell responses of both VSV- and LCMV-infected mice reached near normal levels. Our data provide the first genetic evidence that Vav is an important effector molecule that relays antigen receptor signaling to IL-2 production and activation of cytotoxic T cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	10376601	Modelling T-cell memory by genetic marking of memory T cells in vivo.	"Immunological memory is the ability of the immune system to respond with enhanced vigour to pathogens that have been encountered in the past. Following infection or immunization, most effector T cells undergo apoptotic cell death, but a small fraction of these cells, proportional to the early antigen load and initial clonal burst size, persist in the host as a stable pool of memory T cells. The existence of immunological memory has been recognized for over 2,000 years, but our understanding of this phenomenon is limited, primarily because memory lymphocytes cannot be unequivocally identified as they lack specific, permanent markers. Here we have developed a transgenic mouse model system whereby memory T cells and their precursors can be irreversibly marked with a reporter gene and thus can be unambiguously identified. Adoptive transfer of marked CD8+ T cells specific for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus protected naive recipients following viral challenge, demonstrating that we have marked memory T cells. We also show that cytotoxic effector lymphocytes that develop into memory T cells can be identified in the primary response."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	10518559	Persistence of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus at very low levels in immune mice.	"Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), strain WE, is a non-cytopathic RNA virus that is highly adapted to its natural host, the mouse. Acute infection of adult mice leads to generalized virus spread, followed by cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated virus clearance below the detection levels of conventional assays within 2-3 weeks. Indirect evidence had suggested that virus or viral antigen might persist in the immune mouse. Here we demonstrate LCMV-WE persistence at low levels after infection with 10(2) or 10(6) plaque-forming units, shown as viral genome, viral antigen, and replicative virus using sensitive in vitro and in vivo assays. The finding that LCMV-WE persists in the face of apparently intact immune responses resembles the situation in some viral (hepatitis B and C, HIV) and bacterial (tuberculosis, leprosy) infections in humans; the results are relevant to the understanding not only of other murine and human persistent viral infections but also of protective immunological memory by \"infection immunity.\""	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	10553080	Impaired anti-viral T cell responses due to expression of the Ly49A inhibitory receptor.	"Inhibitory receptors specific for alleles of MHC class I proteins play an important role in determining the reactivity and specificity of NK cells. To determine whether these receptors are also able to regulate T cell functions, we have studied anti-viral immune responses in mice transgenic for a class I-specific inhibitory receptor, Ly49A. Although nontransgenic mice express Ly49A primarily on NK cells and some T cells, the Ly49A transgenic mice express Ly49A on all lymphocytes, including T cells. We have assessed the activation, expansion, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity of CD8 T cells in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice following infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. As expected, nontransgenic mice made a potent virus-specific CD8 T cell response following virus infection. However, as measured in cytolysis assays and by cytokine production, virus-specific CD8 T cell activity was reduced in Ly49A transgenic mice. This inhibition was largely, but not always exclusively, dependent upon the presence, either in vivo or in vitro, of the Ly49A ligand, H-2Dd. Strikingly Ly49A transgenic mice have reduced capacity to control infection with the virulent lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus variant clone 13. Overall, these studies demonstrate that expression of killer inhibitory receptors can modulate anti-viral T cell responses in vivo and in vitro."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	11777992	Nonmitogenic CD3 antibody reverses virally induced (rat insulin promoter-lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) autoimmune diabetes without impeding viral clearance.	"Treatment with nonmitogenic CD3 Ab reverses established autoimmune diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice by restoring self-tolerance, and is currently under clinical evaluation in patients presenting recent onset type I diabetes. Due to the immunosuppressive potential of this strategy, it was relevant to explore how this treatment would influence the outcome of concomitant viral infections. In this study, we used a transgenic model of virally induced autoimmune diabetes (rat insulin promoter-lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) that allows for more precise tracking of the autoaggressive response and choice of the time point for initiation of autoimmunity. CD3 was most effective during a clearly defined prediabetic phase and prevented up to 100% of diabetes by drastically lowering activation of autoaggressive CD8 lymphocytes and their production of inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, reversion of established disease could be achieved as well, when nonmitogenic CD3 was administered late during pathogenesis to overtly diabetic recipients. Most importantly, competence to clear viral infections was maintained. Thus, administration of nonmitogenic CD3 prevents diabetes by sufficient systemic reduction of (auto)aggressive lymphocytes, but without compromising antiviral immune competence."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus	11923871	Severe impairment of interleukin-1 and Toll-like receptor signalling in mice lacking IRAK-4.	"Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and members of the pro-inflammatory interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) family, share homologies in their cytoplasmic domains called Toll/IL-1R/plant R gene homology (TIR) domains. Intracellular signalling mechanisms mediated by TIRs are similar, with MyD88 (refs 5-8) and TRAF6 (refs 9, 10) having critical roles. Signal transduction between MyD88 and TRAF6 is known to involve the serine-threonine kinase IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and two homologous proteins, IRAK-2 (ref. 12) and IRAK-M. However, the physiological functions of the IRAK molecules remain unclear, and gene-targeting studies have shown that IRAK-1 is only partially required for IL-1R and TLR signalling. Here we show by gene-targeting that IRAK-4, an IRAK molecule closely related to the Drosophila Pelle protein, is indispensable for the responses of animals and cultured cells to IL-1 and ligands that stimulate various TLRs. IRAK-4-deficient animals are completely resistant to a lethal dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, animals lacking IRAK-4 are severely impaired in their responses to viral and bacterial challenges. Our results indicate that IRAK-4 has an essential role in innate immunity."	0

"The simultaneous detection test gave no evidence for the presence of RNA tumour viruses in herpesvirus induced malignant lymphomas of non-human primates. The 12 tumours tested were obtained from three different monkey species inoculated with Herpesvirus saimiri or herpesvirus ateles. Particles encapsulating RNA-instructed DNA polymerase and high mol. wt. virus-related RNA were easily demonstrated in tumours of the mouse induced by type-C or type-B oncornaviruses and in human lymphoid cells infected with simian sarcoma virus type I which were examined in parallel. Attempts to demonstrate partial expression of an oncornavirus genome in the herpesvirus induced tumours and attempts to detect an interspecies antigen related to monkey oncornaviruses were negative and strengthened the observations made with the simultaneous detection test."	0

"A cat kidney cell line, CRFK-F2, was successfully inoculated in suspension and in monolayer culture with a purified mouse mammary tumor virus derived from RIII milk. The virus produced by the infected cells was identified by immunogluorescence, electron microscopy, and RNA-directed DNA polymerase assays; it was a B-type virion that did not cross-react with mouse or feline leukemia-sarcoma viruses, had spikes on its envelope, and had a RNA-directed DNA polymerase reaction that was typical of mouse mammary tumor virus. The producing cells were identified as cat cells by chromosome number, cytotoxic assays, and isoenzyme migratory patterns. A standardized method for the in vitro inoculation of cat cells is described that presently permits highly reproducible results. For the first time, the mouse mammary tumor virus is seen replicating in cells from another species, thus offering an opportunity to study the kinetics of infection of that virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	65318	Cell culture factors influencing in vitro expression of mouse mammary tumor virus.	"Several cell culture factors were found to influence in vitro expression of mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) in the mouse adenocarcinoma cell line Mm5mt/c1. Cells were propagated in a variety of commercially available cell culture media to which dexamethasone (DXM) was added as a stimulator of MMTV production. Culture seeding density, culture medium type, and glucose concentration each influenced MMTV production when expressed on a per cell basis. Maximum cell growth occurred in cultures grown in RPMI-1640 medium containing insulin. Those media which provided good cell growth were not necessarily optimal for virus expression. Addition of insulin did not stimulate MMTV synthesis although dexamethasone alone was stimulatory in all media used; however, maximum MMTV expression was obtained when dexamethasone and insulin were used in concert. Equivalent levels of MMTV-specific cell membrane antigen, MMTV-specific protein, and virus particles were produced at incubation temperatures of 32 degrees, 34 degrees or 37 degrees C; however, higher levels of virus-related RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (RDDP) activity were recovered from cultures incubated at 32 degrees and 34 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. Decreased levels of RDDP were attributed to enzyme thermolability at 37 degrees C incubation."	0

"In vitro L1210 (V) cell lines contained abundant intracytoplasmic A-particles, numerous C-type particles, a small number of B-type particles, and occasional intracisternal A-particles. The intracytoplasmic A-particles were incorporated into both spiked (B-type) and smooth-surfaced (C-type) particles formed at the budding site. Both B-and C-type particles also developed by gradual accululation of neucleooid material. The particles, particularly the C-type, exhibited a wide range of densities. The cells showed strong surface immunofluoresence for both murine mammary tumor virus and Gross murine leukemia virus antigens and variable degrees of cytoplasmic immunoflurescence for the protein antigens (p1 to p6) of Rauscher leukemia virus. The cells, the culture supernatant, and the purified virus each gave positive reactions with murine mammary tumor virus and murine leukemia virus antisera by immunodiffusion. The viral particles failed to infect C57BL, C57BL/6 X DBA/2F1 (hereafter called BD2F1), BALB/c, Af,and RIIIf mice.

mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	175934	Correlation of in vitro and in vivo studies of antigens relevant to the control of murine breast cancer.	"The specific immune response of C3H [mammary tumor virus (MTV)] (MTV+) and C3Hf sublines (MTV- or milk-MTV-) to mammary tumors of C3H origin was measured in vitro by the ability of lymphocytes derived from immunized animals to destroy 3H-proline prelabeled target cells after 36 hr of incubation in vitro (lymphocyte:target ratio, 400:1). Primary cytotoxic responses were obtained both in C3H and C3Hf mice and were mediated mainly by T-lymphocytes (Thy.1-positive cells). The degree of cross-reactivity between different C3H mammary tumors showed wide ranges and actually depended on the amounts of MTV-related antigens expressed in the tumor cells. An inverse relationship between MTV-related and H2 histocompatibility antigens was observed. Thy.1.2 antigen (theta-C3H) was also detected on the surface of mammary tumor cells. Both C3H and C3Hf recognized cross-reacting and noncross-reacting antigens in the tumor cells, although the magnitude of the response in the MTV+ mice was lower than in the C3Hf sublines. Soluble antigens could be extracted by 3 M KCl treatment of the tumor cells and could be used as immunogens (eliciting cytotoxic responses against mammary tumor cells), or as stimulators for thymidine uptake (blast transformation in vitro) for specifically immune T-lymphocytes. Attempts to modify spontaneous tumor development in C3H and C3HfA virgin female mice by immunization with formalinized MTV or with soluble antigens extracted from C3H mammary tumors, although still in progress, showed a moderate preventive effect (especially in the C3HfA) immunized with MTV and an acceleration of tumor appearance both in C3H and C3HfA mice immunized with the soluble antigens extracted from C3H mammary tumors. This last set of results, although preliminary, indicates that a better understanding of the immunological events in this system is essential for the design of experiments on prophylaxis of tumor development."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	187788	Long-term effects of neonatal steroid exposure on mammary gland development and tumorigenesis in mice.	"Newborn female mice of three strains--BALB/cfC3H [mammary tumor virus (MuMTV)-infected], BALB/c, and C57BL (both virus-free)--were given injections of 17beta-estradiol or testosterone, alone or in combination with ovine prolactin, for the first 5 days of life. Half of each group of mice were ovariectomized at 40 days of age, and all mice were killed between 6 and 16 months of age. Mammary glands of BALB/cfC3H mice receiving steroid hormones were better developed than those of mice not receiving steroids. Androgen induced a higher incidence of grossly dilated ducts and secretion-filled alveoli. Mammary nodule and tumor incidences were higher in steroid-treated mice than in controls; androgen resulted in higher incidences than did estrogen. The age of onset of mammary tumors was also earlier after neonatal steroid treatment. In BALB/c mice, neonatal injections of estrogen induced some alveolar development of the mammary gland; neonatal injections of ovine prolactin had a greater effect. The mammary glands of C57BL mice did not show any evidence of stimulation by neonatal hormone treatment, which indicated the probability of strain differences. However, no nodules or tumors occurred in these MuMTV-free strains. Therefore, MuMTV was essential for neoplastic mammary responses to neonatal hormone treatment. Ovariectomy prevented alveolar development and abnormal changes in the mammary glands of all groups, thus indicating that ovary-independent alterations in the mammary gland were not induced by neonatal steroid treatment. We concluded that neonatal steroid exposure resulted in increased mammary tumor risk in mice, but only in the presence of both MuMTV and ovaries."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	205366	Immunization of mice against murine mammary tumor virus infection and mammary tumor development.	"Formalin-inactivated whole murine mammary tumor virus (MuMTV), VuMTV membranes, the acid-soluble component of MuMTV, and purified MuMTV glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 55,000 (gp55; also designated as gp52) were used as vaccines in an attempt to identify the MuMTV antigen(s) that can protect mice from exogenous MuMTV infection and subsequent tumor development. Formalin-inactivated whole MuMTV, MuMTV membranes, and purified MuMTV gp55 were effective immunogens, whereas the acid-soluble component of MuMTV (which consists mainly of MuMTV gp55) failed to protect mice from challenge with live virus. These results suggest that (a) MuMTV gp55 is the major immunizing antigen and (b) its native conformation must be maintained for it to be an effective vaccine."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	207603	Hormonal control of mRNA synthesis studied by nucleic acid hybridization.	"The regulation of protein synthesis by steroids is thought to be due to hormonal effects primarily on mRNA concentration. Experimental evidence to support this conclusion has come largely from the use of DNA probes complementary (cDNA) to mRNA molecules or by translation of the mRNA in vitro. In this review the experimental procedures involved and the application to hormone action of cDNA hybridization will be reviewed. (1) mRNA concentrations can be assayed in tissue RNA samples by hybridization with radiolabelled complementary DNA probes (cDNA). From the rate of hybridization of an mRNA preparation to a cDNA probe it is possible to estimate specific mRNA concentrations and thereby study their hormonal regulation within tissues of subcellular fractions (2) Rates of synthesis of a specific RNA can be measured by hybridization of pulse-labelled RNA with excess cold cDNA as illustrated in studies of the glucocorticoid induction of MMTV RNA. (3) Hormore-induced alterations of mRNA populations as a whole can be investigated. From the kinetics of hybridization of mRNA with its complementary DNA it is possible to estimate the number of different RNA sequences in tissues and to approximate the number of copies of each sequence per cell. Consequently, by comparing mRNA samples isolated from tissues of different hormonal status it is possible to demonstrate specific hormone-inducible mRNA species and, in some cases, identify their translation products."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	208768	Observations on the question of horizontal transmission of mouse mammary tumor virus.	"Antigen and tumor incidences in BALB/c and C57BL mice after living as weanlings for 5 weeks in cages with mouse mammary tumor virus-infected females were compared with control BALB/c and C57BL mice living in the same laboratory. All mice were bred continuously, and third-lactation milks were tested for mouse mammary tumor virus antigen by Ouchterlony microimmunodiffusion test. Mammary tumor incidences in the cagemates were not significantly different from those in the controls, although the antigen incidences were significantly greater. However, phosphate-buffered salt solution (0.02 M phosphate, pH 7.4; 0.15 M NaCl; and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and sham-inoculated mice also had elevated antigen incidences. Repeat tests of milks at the fourth or fifth lactations indicated that more than 50% of those positive at the third became negative at later lactations."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	210930	Heterogeneity of tumor cells from a single mouse mammary tumor.	"By the use of a variety of cell culture and separation methods, four cell lines were isolated from a single autochthonous BALB/cfC3H mammary tumor. These lines differ markedly from each other in culture morphology, various in vitro growth properties, expression of murine mammary tumor virus antigen, and karyotype, yet all four lines are tumorigenic in normal, syngeneic hosts, yielding tumors of generally similar histology, although distinct from the original neoplasm. Three of the four lines have been cloned from soft agar. The clones exhibit the same growth properties as the lines from which they were derived. Karyotypic analysis of the parent tumor revealed the presence of cells with heterogeneous numbers of chromosomes similar to those seen in the isolated lines, suggesting both the presence of these distinct cell types in the original neoplasm and a genetic origin of the diversity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mouse mammary tumor virus	21274409	Mouse mammary tumor virus molecular biology and oncogenesis.	"Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), which was discovered as a milk-transmitted, infectious cancer-inducing agent in the 1930s, has been used since that time as an animal model for the study of human breast cancer. Like other complex retroviruses, MMTV encodes a number of accessory proteins that both facilitate infection and affect host immune response. In vivo, the virus predominantly infects lymphocytes and mammary epithelial cells. High level infection of mammary epithelial cells ensures efficient passage of virus to the next generation. It also results in mammary tumor induction, since the MMTV provirus integrates into the mammary epithelial cell genome during viral replication and activates cellular oncogene expression. Thus, mammary tumor induction is a by-product of the infection cycle. A number of important oncogenes have been discovered by carrying out MMTV integration site analysis, some of which may play a role in human breast cancer."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	172448	Murine cytomegalovirus: induction of and sensitivity to interferon in vitro.	"Moderate amounts of viral inhibitor were produced by mouse embryo (ME) cultures infected with two strains of plaque-purified murine cytomegalovirus (MCV). This inhibitor was shown to be interferon, based on the possession of similar properties. The growth studies of MCV in ME cells showed that interferon was produced as early as 4 h after infection, infectious virus was produced between 12 to 16 h, and cytopathic effect was produced between 16 to 18 h. Since MCV-induced interferon production and the subsequent development of antiviral state occurred early, the long eclipse period may be due to an interferon-mediated delay of virus replication. Pretreatment of ME cells with varying concentrations of interferon before infection with MCV did not result in increased interferon production, but at high pretreatment doses a slight inhibitory effect on interferon production was observed. In vitro sensitivity studies showed that small doses of MCV were highly sensitive to the antiviral action of interferon, but higher viral doses proved to be markedly resistant. Although the available evidence does not permit a definitive interpretation of the mechanism by which MCV may show differing sensitivities to interferon action, the presence of a small interferon-resistant fraction of virus-infected cells may account for the observations."	0

"Intact and zona-free mouse preimplantation embryos were exposed to murine cytomegalovirus in vitro at various stages of development. The embryos developed normally to the blastocyst stage, and there was no evidence of embryonic infection. Intraperitoneal inoculation of female mice with this virus produced an acute generalized infection, and embryonic development was retarded in vivo. The embryos themselves were not productively infected, and they developed into apparently normal fetuses when transferred to uninfected mice."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	686707	Antiviral activity of extracts from marine algae.	"Extracts of two species of marine algae, Constantinea simplex and Farlowia mollis, were tested for antiviral activity in tissue culture and in experimental infections of mice. Treatment of confluent mouse embryo fibroblast cell monolayers with either compound before viral inoculation was effective in inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, vaccinia virus, and vesicular stomatitis virus, but not encephalomyocarditis virus, Semliki Forest virus, or murine cytomegalovirus. Prophylactic administration of these extracts was effective in reducing final mortality or prolonging the mean day of death of animals inoculated by the intraperitoneal, intracerebral, or intranasal routes with herpes simplex virus type 2. When therapy was initiated after viral inoculation or at a site other than that of viral inoculation, no significant effect on mortality or on mean day of death was observed. Neither preparation was effective in mice inoculated intraperitoneally with encephalomyocarditis virus, Semliki Forest virus, or murine cytomegalovirus or in animals infected intravaginally with herpes simplex virus type 2. The prophylactic but not therapeutic antiviral activity of these preparations seriously limits their potential use in human herpes simplex virus infections."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	1329629	Treatment of murine cytomegalovirus infections in severe combined immunodeficient mice with ganciclovir, (S)-1-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine, interferon, and bropirimine.	"Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were found to be highly susceptible to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Treatment of infected mice with ganciclovir (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/kg of body weight for 10 days) starting 24 h after virus challenge resulted in delays in death by 2 to 8 days, and no animals survived the infection. (S)-1-[3-Hydroxy-2-(phosphonylmethoxy)propyl]cytosine (HPMPC) was much more potent, with doses of 1, 3.2, and 10 mg/kg/day (for 10 days) increasing the mean survival time by 15 to 30 days. Twenty-day treatments with HPMPC starting 5 days after virus inoculation increased the mean survival time by 24 to 32 days, with once-weekly (50-mg/kg) treatments being equivalent to daily (10-mg/kg) treatments. Delays in the development of liver, lung, and spleen virus titers in ganciclovir- and HPMPC-treated groups correlated with extensions in the mean survival times relative to the survival times of the placebo controls. The two compounds were approximately equally toxic to uninfected BALB/c mice treated for 10 days, causing 80 to 100% mortality after a dose of 150 mg/kg and 0% mortality after a dose of 75 mg/kg. Thus, the relative therapeutic index of HPMPC was 50-fold greater than that of ganciclovir. Recombinant alpha interferon delta 4 alpha 1/alpha 2 (1 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(4) units per mouse per day) and bropirimine (100 and 300 mg/kg/day) provided no protection from the lethal MCMV infection. The severe combined immunodeficient mouse MCMV infection is an important new model that will permit chemotherapy regimens to be studied over several months."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	1333757	Susceptibility of mouse embryo to murine cytomegalovirus infection in early and mid-gestation stages.	"The susceptibility of mouse embryonic cells to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was studied by injecting the virus in the early and mid-gestation stages. For the early stage, blastocysts from BDF1 mice were injected with MCMV or minimal essential medium (MEM) by micromanipulator and returned to the uteri of pseudopregnant ICR mice. On day 11 of gestation, the embryos were examined immunohistochemically, using antibody specific to the early antigen of MCMV, and the placentae were examined by plaque assay. No infection was detected by either method. Furthermore, no infection was detected in MCMV-infected blastocysts that were cultured and examined for infection by immunofluorescence. For mid-gestation embryos, the conceptus was injected with MCMV on day 8.5 of gestation and was subjected to immunohistochemical analysis from day 10.5 to 12.5 of gestation. Viral antigen-positive cells were first observed in the placentae, then antigen-positive cells appeared among the blood cells, endothelial and mesodermal cells of the embryos. On day 12.5 of gestation, clusters of viral antigen-positive cells were sometimes observed in the hearts and livers. Although the incidence was lower, viral antigen-positive cells were also observed in the neuroectoderm and the eyes. These results suggest that MCMV does not infect early embryos and that infection first occurs in the placenta of postimplantation embryos, whence it extends through the blood cells to the endothelial and mesodermal cells of different embryonic regions, eventually extending to the neuroectoderm."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2171343	T-lymphocyte effects on murine cytomegalovirus pulmonary infection.	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections were induced in male BALB/c mice treated with rat monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to deplete selectively CD8 and CD4 cell populations in vivo. The animals were then inoculated intraperitoneally with murine CMV and the infection was monitored virologically and histologically. High concentrations of virus were found in the lungs of mice depleted of CD4 or both CD4 and CD8 cells. These animals developed pulmonary infections that persisted for at least 49 days after inoculation. In contrast, immunologically intact mice and those administered anti-CD8 MAb experienced only a transient infection of the lungs. Focal interstitial infiltrates of mononuclear cells were demonstrated in pulmonary tissues of CD4 MAb-treated animals, but not in normal mice and those receiving the CD8 MAb. Adoptive transfer of CD4 cells to animals (rendered immune-incompetent by thymectomy and irradiation) protected against pulmonary infection and the development of interstitial pneumonia. Mice treated with CD4 MAb failed to produce specific CMV antibody, whereas the depletion of CD8 cells had no effect on antibody elaboration. Administration of anti-CD4 and CD8 MAb did not affect virus replication in the salivary glands, the preferential site for CMV infection in the mouse. Induction of pulmonary infection and interstitial pneumonia by CMV in BALB/c mice is mediated by CD4 T cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2174234	Cytomegalovirus-induced pneumonitis and myocarditis in newborn mice. A model for perinatal human cytomegalovirus infection.	"Genetically determined resistance to the lethal effects of infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) has been reported previously in adult and newborn mice. We examined the pathogenesis of MCMV infection in resistant (CBA, H-2k) and susceptible (BALB/c, H-2d) mice infected intraperitoneally on the day of birth. BALB/c mice developed a severe interstitial pneumonitis and myocarditis 10 days post-infection. Their pulmonary and tissues contained high MCMV titres and large numbers of MCMV-antigen positive cells. MCMV also infected the endothelial and myointimal cells of the coronary arteries in newborn BALB/c mice. Only limited infection and pathological changes were seen in CBA mice. Since the severe disease in BALB/c mice resembles the pneumonitis and less frequently reported myocarditis observed after perinatal HCMV infection, the newborn mouse model will be useful for studying the consequences and treatment of such infections, the influence of the host genotype on disease severity and the possible association between perinatal HCMV infection and atherosclerosis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2426022	Changes in the phenotype of T-cell subset determinants following murine cytomegalovirus infection.	"The murine model provides a particularly apt experimental system in which to evaluate the effects of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV exerts a profound \"suppression\" of the immune response in the mouse and in humans; the infected animal is no longer able to mediate an appropriate response to mitogens or alloantigens. Using fluorocytometry and fluoresceinated monoclonal antibodies directed against the Thy-1.2, Lyt-1, and Lyt-2 cell membrane determinants following a nonlethal intraperitoneal inoculation of weanling BALB/c mice with Smith strain murine cytomegalovirus, significant changes in T-cell subsets were found that are consistent with findings described in the clinical situation. These ratio changes are temporally consistent with the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte population described by others. Finally, novel changes in the antigenic determinant distribution is found which may reflect the appearance of an antigen-committed cytotoxic T-lymphocyte population. This population which peaks at the ninth postinfection day may consist of 20-47% of the T-lymphocyte population and may offer an explanation for the cellular hyporesponsiveness seen following CMV infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2462012	Relationship between the production of murine cytomegalovirus and interferon in macrophages.	"Macrophages (M phi) harvested from the peritoneal cavities of mice after thioglycollate stimulation could be infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), although the efficiency of infection was low. Sequential measurements of interferon (IFN) production by virus-infected M phi were performed in an attempt to explain the characteristics of MCMV infection in the cell cultures. Infected M phi produced moderate amounts of IFN, which was completely neutralized by anti-IFN-alpha/beta serum. The IFN was detectable in cultures as early as 8 h after infection and was produced only by exposing M phi to infectious virus. Production increased until 48 to 72 h and preceded virus production, which was initially detected 72 h after infection. Treatment of the M phi cultures with anti-IFN-alpha/beta resulted not only in a marked increase in virus production, as well as a shortening of the long eclipse period of MCMV infection, but also induced increases in the number of M phi releasing MCMV (VR-M phi). Thus, the IFN produced in MCMV-infected M phi (MCMV-M phi IFN) appeared to suppress the production and spread of MCMV. The increase in the number of VR-M phi observed was more resistant to anti-IFN-alpha/beta treatment than the production of infectious virus. The antiviral effect of MCMV-M phi IFN on MCMV infection in mouse embryo fibroblasts was similar to that induced by IFN-alpha/beta. Therefore, MCMV-M phi IFN appeared to be more active in protecting against the spread of cell-free MCMV than of cell-associated virus. These differences in sensitivity to IFN action suggest that M phi may have a role in the latency of MCMV and that their production of IFN may facilitate the generation of latent infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2484431	Host-mediated antiviral activity of Lactobacillus casei against cytomegalovirus infection in mice.	"The protective effect of heat-killed Lactobacillus casei (LC) against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection was examined. ICR mice treated once with LC 1 day or 2 days before challenge survived lethal infection, but untreated or Lactobacillus fermentum (LF)-treated mice did not. The protective effect was evidenced by an increase in plaque-forming units (PFU) per 50% lethal dose (LD50) and a decrease in titers of infectious viruses replicated in the target organs. This was further confirmed by severity of histopathological damage to the target organs, especially the liver. LC neither inactivated MCMV nor inhibited its replication in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). The spleen cells from LC-treated mice inhibited its replication in MEF on co-cultivation. Augmentation by LC of splenic natural killer (NK) cell activity correlated with survival of mice from otherwise lethal MCMV infection. Cytotoxic activity of peritoneal cells and level of serum interferon (IFN) were elevated after MCMV infection, but they were not associated with survival of mice nor with treatment of LC. The protective effect of LC was not clear in NK-deficient beige mutant (bgJ/bgJ) mice, when compared with that in their littermate (bgJ/+) mice. Poor protection of bgJ/bgJ mice by LC treatment correlated with failure to induce NK cell activity by LC treatment in the mutant mice. Thus, it is likely that LC protects mice from MCMV infection by augmentation of NK cell activity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2537363	Virus-induced polyclonal cytotoxic T lymphocyte stimulation.	"Infections with a variety of viruses (lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus, Pichinde virus, vaccinia virus) stimulated C57BL/6 mice to generate allospecific CTL coincidental with the generation of virus-specific CTL. In C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice, LCMV-induced CTL with reactivity against cells from mice bearing gene products of the d, f, k, p, q, and s but not the b MHC loci. Studies with congenic mouse strains indicated that the MHC loci coded for the target of the allospecific killer cells. The targets of the allospecific CTL were further identified as class I MHC Ag by three criteria: 1) target cells from congenic strains of mice differing from effector cells only in the expression of class I Ag were sensitive to lysis; 2) fibroblasts expressing low levels of class I Ag were resistant to lysis but were rendered sensitive after treatment with IFN-beta, which induced higher expression of class I Ag; and 3) antibody specific for class I Ag expressed on the target cell blocked killing. Studies with congenic mouse strains also suggested that the ability to generate high levels of the virus-induced allospecific killer cells was also under MHC regulation, as H-2b mice generated high levels and H-2k mice low levels of the allospecific CTL. Both C3H/St and C57BL/6 mice immunized against LCMV developed detectable LCMV-specific CTL when later challenged with either murine cytomegalovirus, Pichinde virus, or vaccinia virus, indicating that a virus infection can stimulate the reappearance of memory CTL. Cold target competition studies indicated no cross-reactivities between these viruses or allogeneic cells at the CTL level. Both the allospecific CTL and the reactivated LCMV-specific CTL were found in blast-size lymphocyte preparations. Spleen cells taken from LCMV-infected C57BL/6 mice 5 days post-infection spontaneously generated into allospecific and virus-specific CTL after 2 days of culture. The generation of both was dependent on the presence of supernatant factors produced only in the presence of L3T4+ cells. These factors activated allospecific CTL in spleen cells from virus-primed mice but not from control mice. We suggest that lymphokines produced as a consequence of virus infection may act to stimulate the proliferation and activation of CTL not specific to the challenge virus, resulting in a virus-induced polyclonal CTL stimulation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2549652	Brain abnormalities induced by murine cytomegalovirus injected into the cerebral ventricles of mouse embryos exo utero.	"Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) was injected into the cerebral ventricle of mouse embryos on day 13 of gestation after exposing the embryos out of the uterus in the abdominal cavity of the mother. The embryos were allowed to develop to day 18 of gestation, then taken out from the abdominal cavity. Macroscopically, there were four expanded and three distorted brains out of 19 surviving embryos, whereas no brain abnormality was noticed in 13 embryos injected with culture medium instead of MCMV in the same way. Histopathological examination showed hydrocephalic lesions with strong dilatation of the ventricles and atrophy of the cerebral cortex, and inflammatory lesions with granulomatous proliferation of the ventricular walls with disappearance of the cortical zonation. Immunohistochemically, MCMV-induced nuclear antigen-positive cells were frequently observed in the wall of the ventricles and occasionally scattered in the cerebral cortex, white matter, and the nucleus basalis. Some fetuses injected with MCMV in the same way were recovered from the abdominal cavities on day 18 of gestation and transferred to foster nurse mothers. They showed massive cerebral necrosis after feeding for 9 days after birth. Brain abnormalities of mouse embryos after intraventricular injection with MCMV may provide an experimental model of brain damage induced by congenital cytomegalovirus infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2554856	Evaluation of continuous cell lines in antiviral studies with murine cytomegalovirus.	"Cell culture systems were developed for rapid antiviral drug screening, using murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) as an alternative to the slower growing human CMV. Since previous assay methods with MCMV employed mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF cells), which are labor intensive to prepare and die off after 3-4 passages from primary culture, identification of virus-susceptible continuous cell lines was desirable. Three cell lines were found useful for assaying MCMV: C127I, SC-1, and 3T3. The antiviral agents acyclovir, ganciclovir, 5-fluoroarabinofuranosylcytosine, and 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxy-5-iodoarabinofuranosylcytosine were evaluated in the 3 continuous cell lines and in MEF cells. The 50% virus- or cell-inhibitory concentration values determined for each compound did not vary much from cell to cell. MEF cells were 10-fold more sensitive than the other cell lines to quantify virus from mouse organs, however. Virus propagated in 3T3 and SC-1 cells were as virulent to mice as salivary gland virus, whereas virus from MEF and C127I cells was more attenuated. Overall, C127I cells were judged to be the best for large scale antiviral screening in vitro, but MEF was the cell type of choice for titration of viruses from mouse organs and tissues."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2825950	Murine cytomegalovirus-Pseudomonas synergistic infections: comparison of virulent and attenuated virus.	"The synergistic interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and virulent or attenuated murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) were compared in vivo. Virulent MCMV challenge at a dose of 5 X 10(5) pfu/mouse intraperitoneally, followed by intranasal superinfection with 5 X 10(6) cfu/mouse of Pseudomonas aeruginosa after 48 h resulted in greater than 80% mortality, apparently owing to a failure of pulmonary clearance mechanisms. Single infections, or the use of attenuated MCMV in synergistic infections, did not result in significant morbidity or mortality. Infection with virulent MCMV in vivo resulted in the rapid spread of virus to the lung, liver, and spleen, followed later by spread to the salivary glands. Attenuated virus was detected in salivary glands only. Virulent MCMV was more effective in adsorbing to, or infecting, spleen cells in vitro than attenuated virus. Viral neutralization experiments using anti-viral serum, rabbit complement, and anti-mouse IgG confirmed the presence of a nonneutralizing antibody on the surface of the virulent virus. Our results suggest that the presence of the nonneutralizing antibody on virulent MCMV allows the virus to preferentially infect, or adsorb to, Fc+ cells in the peritoneum. These cells may then carry the virus, via the lymphatic circulation, to other areas of the body, resulting in the replication of virus in multiple organs. Virus replication in the lung may, in part, be the cause of the observed suppression of pulmonary clearance."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2837837	Experimental analysis of concurrent viral and bacterial infection in the mouse.	"The roles of both microorganisms in combined murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) infection in the mouse, and host response to the infection were investigated. Increased mortality in mixed MCMV and KP infected mice was observed, and this was due to uncontrolled growth of bacteria in the peritoneal cavity, and severe generalized infection. Neutrophil response to growth of KP was defective in MCMV infected mice. While the initial clearance of KP from the blood was more efficient in MCMV-infected mice, it did not protect the mice against KP infection. In the in vitro experiments, the neutrophil chemotaxis of MCMV-infected mice to KP was found to be lowered. Tissue extract and serum of MCMV-infected mice exhibited chemotactic activity for neutrophils, and, at the same time contained some factor(s) which reduced chemotaxis of normal neutrophils to KP."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2841487	The 89,000-Mr murine cytomegalovirus immediate-early protein stimulates c-fos expression and cellular DNA synthesis.	"The immediate-early (IE) genes of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) are expressed in the absence of prior viral protein synthesis and regulate the transcription of MCMV early genes. The effect of MCMV IE genes on growth induction was studied. Different plasmids containing MCMV IE genes were microinjected into arrested NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. Plasmids containing the ieI gene coding for the 89,000-Mr major IE protein pp89 were found to stimulate the expression of the c-fos protooncogene. Synthesis of pp89 and its transport to the nucleus appeared to be required for c-fos expression. DNA synthesis occurred in cells that were injected with MCMV IE genes and in neighboring cells that were not injected. The results suggest that the phosphoprotein pp89 stimulates cells to enter the cell cycle."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	2875543	The effects of maternal murine cytomegalovirus infection on the mouse conceptus at different gestational stages.	"The effects of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) on the prenatal development of the CD-1 mouse were investigated. Two sets of experiments were performed. In the first, mice were inoculated with different doses of MCMV on gestational day 7, and in the second, pregnant animals were inoculated with a subacute injection dose at different gestational stages. The effects of maternal infection on pregnancy in terms of maternal sickness, embryo lethality, date of parturition, litter size, postnatal death, and pups' body weight on d 1 and d 3 postpartum were investigated. High-dose MCMV infection on d 7 of pregnancy resulted in a significant increase in early embryo resorption and also in a reduction of the neonatal body weight of surviving pups. Two gestational stages were identified as being especially susceptible to MCMV infection. Most embryonic death as indicated by resorption rates was found after treatment on d 9, whereas perinatal death was most frequent when treatment was done on d 13 of gestation. Still births and neonatal death within 24 h of birth were found commonly in this latter group, which also showed the most pronounced growth retardation. The phenomenon of delay in time of parturition was noted and found to be most significant in groups of animals that were inoculated on d 3 or d 13. This investigation suggests that the effects of MCMV on the CD-1 mouse vary greatly with the age of the embryo and the course of the infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	3003382	Pathogenesis of acute murine cytomegalovirus infection in resistant and susceptible strains of mice.	"We have characterized the progress of acute murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection in the spleen, liver, and salivary gland of susceptible (BALB/c) and resistant (C3H) strains of mice after intraperitoneal inoculation. Viral replication was analyzed by virus titration, infectious-center assays, and in situ cytohybridization with cloned subgenomic fragments of the MCMV genome. The most striking differences between strains were observed in the spleen. At 24 h postinfection (p.i.), both strains had a similar number of infected spleen cells. At 48 h p.i., BALB/c mice showed marked dissemination of the splenic infection which continued until 96 h p.i. In contrast, the number of infected C3H spleen cells did not increase from the 24-h level but declined later on. This early block in dissemination of MCMV infection in C3H mouse spleens was not a result of the H-2k haplotype, as BALB.K (H-2k) mice, which show an intermediate level of resistance to MCMV infection, exhibited dissemination of the infection between 24 and 48 h p.i., albeit at a reduced level. However, between 72 and 96 h p.i., we observed a decline in the number of infected spleen cells in BALB.K mice similar to that observed in C3H mice. We also demonstrated by Southern blot analysis of DNA from the infected spleen cells that the termini of the MCMV genome fuse after in vivo infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	3027167	Accumulation and chemotaxis of natural killer/large granular lymphocytes at sites of virus replication.	"A model for monitoring the accumulation of natural killer cell/large granular lymphocytes (NK/LGL) at a site of virus replication was studied by using mice infected i.p. with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Pichinde virus, or vaccinia virus. An i.p. but not i.v. infection resulted in a localized increase in NK/LGL cell number (a fourfold to greater than 20-fold increase) and augmentation (a 10- to 20-fold increase) of NK cell activity associated with virus-induced peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. An increase in NK/LGL cell number was detected as early as 12 hr postinfection (p.i.) and peaked at 3 days p.i. with MHV. The initial LGL recruited into the peritoneal cavity at 1 to 3 days p.i. were nonadherent to plastic and were demonstrated to have an NK cell phenotype: asialo GM1+, Thy-1.2 +/-, Lyt-2.2-, and J11d-. The peak number of LGL appeared at 7 days after infection with the NK cell-resistant virus, LCMV. This LGL population had been previously demonstrated to contain cytotoxic T lymphocyte/LGL (CTL/LGL) as well as NK/LGL. During an MHV infection the number of LGL decreased between days 3 and 7 p.i., suggesting that the second wave of CTL/LGL was absent. These findings may explain the absence of a good MHV-CTL model. Virus-induced, activated NK/LGL responded to chemotactic signals by migrating in a unidirectional manner across two 5-microns pore size polycarbonate filters during 7 hr in vitro chemotaxis assays. Wash-out fluid obtained from the peritoneal cavity contained chemotactic activity for NK/LGL as well as for other cell types. We conclude that production and/or release of chemotactic factors at sites of virus replication are at least partially responsible for the accumulation of NK/LGL at these sites."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	3029242	Early-stage developmental abnormalities induced by murine cytomegalovirus.	"The onset of the effects of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection on an early stage of embryonic development (nine days) in a mouse model was studied with the aid of scanning electron microscopy. MCMV was injected into the endometrial lumina of pregnant mice at the time of implantation. The mice were later killed, and sites of embryonic implantation were examined. Compared with uninfected mice and mice inoculated with heat-inactivated virus, litter sizes were reduced, and the incidence of abnormal fetuses was significantly increased among MCMV-infected animals. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed maldeveloped cranial regions characterized by an unclosed neural tube and severely underdeveloped head. Ectodermal abnormalities, including poxlike formations and ballooning cells, were observed in several embryos. Thus, early cytomegalovirus infection may not only result in fetal loss, but may also interfere with the process of morphogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	3034066	Murine cytomegalovirus infection of cultured mouse embryos.	"Isolated mouse whole embryos of 7.5 days' gestation were infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and cultured in pure rat serum. Although the MCMV infection had little effect on the survival and development of the embryos during 3 days of cultivation, immunohistochemical analysis of their serial sections using monoclonal antibody showed MCMV-infected cells in various portions of the embryos. This monoclonal antibody, when tested with the use of infected cultured mouse fibroblasts, reacted with nuclear antigen within 2 hours after infection and also reacted with nuclear inclusions in the late phase of infection. The viral antigen-positive cells detected by the monoclonal antibody were present in almost all of the ectoplacental cone and the yolk sac and in about 82% of the embryos. In the embryos, antigen-positive cells were frequently observed in the epithelium of the digestive tracts, endothelial cells of the blood vessels, and the mesodermal cells. In some of the embryos, viral antigen-positive cells were clearly observed in a small percentage of the blood cells. These findings indicate that blood cells, in addition to cell migration during embryogenesis, may play an important role in transmission of infectious virus into the embryos. Mouse whole embryo culture infected with MCMV can provide a model for the study of cellular tropism related to congenital infection by cytomegalovirus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	3038737	The cytotoxic response to murine cytomegalovirus: requirements for the generation of MCMV-specific target cells.	"The preparation of target cells susceptible to lysis by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-immune T cells in vitro was investigated and found to be dependent upon target cell type, culture conditions, virus adsorption protocol and virus preparation. Optimally sensitive MCMV-infected targets were obtained by preculture of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) in 3% vol/vol concanavalin-A-stimulated spleen cell supernatant (CSS)-supplemented medium, adsorption of salivary gland stock MCMV under 800 g centrifugation and at least 4 h further incubation at 37 degrees before addition of T cells. In contrast, salivary gland stock MCMV did not cause thioglycollate-induced peritoneal exudate cells to be susceptible to MCMV-specific T cell-mediated lysis, whereas tissue culture-passaged stock MCMV was successful. The preparation of MCMV-infected target cells is discussed in terms of the need for H-2 and viral antigen expression for T cell recognition."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	3039695	Murine cytomegalovirus infection model in Balb/c mice--1. Virological and pathological profiles in mice inoculated with various virus doses.	"By intraperitoneal injection of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in Balb/c mice at doses of 2 X 10(6), 2 X 10(5) and 2 X 10(4) pfu per mouse, lethal, acute but non-lethal and asymptomatic infection were produced respectively. 100% mortality was found in mice infected with the lethal dose, as well as high MCMV titres in liver and spleen, severe necrosis of the spleen and severe degeneration of the liver. In these mice leukocyte counts in blood was not raised and inflammatory responses in the peritoneum, spleen and liver were not observed. Mice with acute but non-lethal infection showed less severe pathological changes, moderate spleen necrosis was followed by spleen enlargement. In this group of mice, severe mononucleosis was observed, and moderate inflammatory reactions were noted in the peritoneum, liver and spleen. Mice asymptomatically infected exhibited slight mononucleosis in the blood and splenomegaly."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	6171240	Neutralization of different strains of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-effect of in vitro passage.	"Two strains of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) propagated in mouse salivary glands could be distinguished in neutralization tests. Cell (mouse embryo fibroblast)-passaged virus of either strain was generally 10-20 times easier to neutralize than virus produced in mouse salivary glands. Evidence was obtained that mouse immunoglobulin was attached to virus particles in salivary gland preparations. First, antibody to mouse immunoglobulin inactivated salivary gland virus but not cell culture-grown virus. Second, virus obtained from mice early after infection, before antibody production, was as easy to neutralize as cell culture-grown virus. The attached immunoglobulins were CMV-specific, non-neutralizing, and interfered with the action of neutralizing antibody. Non-neutralizing antibodies that bind to infectious virus particles are present in mouse serum at the time salivary glands are harvested, 3 weeks after infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	6172385	Natural cytotoxicity of murine cytomegalovirus-infected cells mediated by mouse lymphoid cells: role of interferon in the endogenous natural cytotoxicity reaction.	"Lymphoid cells from unstimulated normal C57BL/6J mice were shown to lyse murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-infected syngeneic mouse embryo fibroblasts but not uninfected mouse embryo fibroblasts. This cytotoxicity by mouse effector cells was not restricted to MCMV-infected syngeneic cells since MCMV-infected xenogeneic rat heart fibroblasts were also lysed. Characterization of the effector cells mediating this cytotoxicity against MCMV-infected cells indicated that the effector cells are similar to described natural killer (NK) cells mediating lysis of tumor cells and virus-infected cells. Because of the described augmentation of NK activity by interferon, we examined the role of interferon in the NK reaction. Although low levels of virus-induced interferon were detectable in supernatants of MCMV-infected mouse embryo fibroblasts, no interferon was detectable in supernatants of MCMV-infected rat heart fibroblasts, a target significantly more sensitive to NK cytolysis than infected mouse embryo fibroblasts. We were able to augment the NK reaction against MCMV-infected cells by in vitro treatments with interferon. However, the amounts of interferon required for augmentation were significantly greater than the amounts generated by infected target cells. In vitro interferon-stimulated NK cells retained selective cytotoxic activity since they continued to remain incapable of lysing uninfected target cells. MCMV-infected rat heart fibroblasts induced more interferon and were also more susceptible to NK activity than MCMV-infected mouse embryo fibroblasts. In spite of this difference in interferon-inducing capacity, there was no augmentation of cytotoxicity of MCMV-infected mouse embryo fibroblasts when mouse splenocytes were cocultivated with both target cells. Finally, when production of interferon in the NK reaction was inhibited by the addition of actinomycin D, no reduction of NK activity was seen. Our findings suggest that native mouse NK cells can discriminate between MCMV-infected cells and uninfected cells, this ability leading to the selective lysis of the virus-infected cells. Furthermore, although we could demonstrate augmentation of NK activity by interferon, interferon activation of NK cells may not be a necessary precondition for the development of endogenous NK activity."	0

"Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) produced a cytopathic effect in mouse brain, guinea pig embryonic brain, human brain and fibroblast cells. Virus-specific antigen was detected by immunofluorescence in these cells after primary infection with MCMV. MCMV also replicated in ouse embryo brain and guinea pig brain cells.

mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	6290595	Variation in murine cytomegalovirus replication in fibroblasts from different mouse strains in vitro: correlation with in vivo resistance.	"The in vitro growth of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) from Balb/c, C57BL, C3H and CBA mouse strains has been shown to correlate with the genetically determined in vivo susceptibility of these strains to MCMV infection. MEF from Balb/c and C57BL mice were more susceptible to MCMV than those from C3H and CBA mice. This was evident regardless of whether replication was measured by cytopathic effect (c.p.e.) score, virus yield, plaque count, plaque size or time of onset of c.p.e. The growth of MCMV in tracheal organ cultures from different mouse strains was similar to that observed in MEF from these strains. The replication in MEF when measured by c.p.e. score and virus yield was affected by the density of the cell cultures. The strain of mouse used to produce MCMV also affected the comparative sensitivity of MEF to the virus. This appeared to be due to reduced growth of MCMV in its homologous MEF type, an unexpected result. In contrast, cell density had little effect on the replication of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), but again the in vitro susceptibility of MEF reflected the in vivo susceptibility of mouse strains to infection with this virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	7513920	Identification and characterization of a murine cytomegalovirus gene with homology to the UL25 open reading frame of human cytomegalovirus.	"Monoclonal antibody 1B4, previously shown to be protective in vivo and to cross-react with both virally encoded and normal host cell proteins, was used to screen a lambda gt11 cDNA derived from mRNA harvested from mouse embryo fibroblasts 24 hr after infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). A 700-bp cDNA was identified representing the 5'terminus of a 2460-bp open reading frame (ORF) with significant homology to the human cytomegalovirus UL25 ORF. The UL25 ORF of MCMV potentially encodes an 820 amino acid viral tegument protein with an estimated molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa. Amino acid homology with eukaryotic nucleolins was identified in the acidic N-terminal third of the MCMV UL25 proteins, suggesting that the protein may be involved in transcriptional activation or interactions with chromatin. Northern analysis and S1 nuclease data indicated that the gene is expressed late in infection as an approximately 3-kb transcript and that expression is dependent on viral DNA replication. An epitope recognized by MAb 1B4 was identified using recombinant pGEX plasmids expressing fusion proteins representing the N-terminal region of the MCMV UL25 protein. The identification of the MCMV UL25 ORF as a member of the CMV-specific UL25/UL35 gene family provides an opportunity for the investigation of the role these genes and their products in CMV pathogenesis in an animal model."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	7561678	Requirement for natural killer cell-produced interferon gamma in defense against murine cytomegalovirus infection and enhancement of this defense pathway by interleukin 12 administration.	"The presence of natural killer (NK) cells contributes to early defense against murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Although NK cells can mediate in vivo protection against MCMV, the mechanism by which they do so has not been defined. The studies presented here evaluate cytokine production by NK cells activated during MCMV infection and the role of NK cell-produced cytokines in early in vivo antiviral defenses. Experiments with normal C57BL/6, T cell-deficient C57BL/6 nude, and severe combined immunodeficient mice lacking T and B cells demonstrated that both interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) production were induced at early times after infection with MCMV. Conditioned media samples prepared with cells from these mice, on day 2 after infection, produced 11-43 pg/million cells of IFN-gamma and 12-19 pg/million cells of TNF as evaluated by specific protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Studies in the NK- and T cell-deficient mouse line, E26, in mice that had been depleted in vivo of NK cells by treatment with antibodies eliminating NK cells, anti-asialo ganglio-N-tetraosylceramide or anti-NK1.1, and with populations of cells that had been depleted of NK cells by complement treatment with the anti-NK cell antibody, SW3A4, demonstrated that NK cells were solely responsible for the IFN-gamma but were not required for TNF production. The in vivo absence of NK cells was accompanied by increased viral hepatitis and viral replication in both immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice, as well as decreased survival time of immunodeficient mice. In vivo treatments with antibodies neutralizing IFN-gamma demonstrated that this factor contributed to the NK cell-mediated antiviral defense and reduced the measured parameters of viral defense to levels indistinguishable from those observed in NK cell-deficient mice. These effects appeared to be independent of cytolytic activity, as NK cells isolated from anti-IFN-gamma-treated mice mediated killing at levels comparable to those observed in control-treated mice. The consequences of interleukin 12 (IL-12) administration, a known potent inducer of IFN-gamma production by NK cells, were evaluated in MCMV-infected mice. Low IL-12 doses, i.e., 1 ng/d, increased NK cell cytotoxicity and IFN-gamma production up to twofold and resulted in improved antiviral status; virus-induced hepatitis was decreased as much as fivefold, and viral burdens were decreased to levels below detection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	7853515	Latency, without persistence, of murine cytomegalovirus in the spleen and kidney.	"It is not known if murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) establishes a state of molecular latency independent of low-level persistent infection. The presence of low levels of infectious MCMV distinguishes persistence from molecular latency. Thus, the distinction between persistence and latency has depended on the sensitivity of plaque assays for detecting low levels of infectious virus in tissue of previously infected mice. To determine whether MCMV establishes molecular latency or remains persistent, we developed two assays for detecting low levels of MCMV in tissue. Using prolonged in vitro culture of virus with either mouse embryonic fibroblasts or the murine 3T12 fibroblast cell line, we reproducibly detected a single PFU of MCMV. Inclusion of undiluted sonicated tissue in this assay decreased sensitivity by up to 100-fold. However, sensitivity was improved to 1 PFU of MCMV when sonicated tissue was appropriately diluted. Severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were also used to detect MCMV in sonicated tissue. Infection of SCID mice with a single PFU of MCMV killed two of eight SCID mice, and the 50% lethal dose of MCMV in SCID mice was 2 to 3 PFU. Applying these two methods, we detected infectious virus in 0 of 34 spleens, 1 of 34 kidneys, and 0 of 37 salivary glands from latently infected mice. Spleens and kidneys assessed for persistent virus contained MCMV DNA by PCR and reactivated after 10 to 50 days in explant cultures. Latently infected kidney cells reactivated after adoptive transfer to SCID mice. Quantitation of the MCMV genome by PCR showed that latently infected spleens without detectable infectious MCMV contained about 3,000,000 copies of the MCMV genome. These results demonstrate that MCMV latency in spleen and kidney exists in the absence of low-level persistent infection. Use of assays with defined sensitivity for detection of MCMV in tissue provides a basis for evaluation of cytomegalovirus gene expression in the spleen and kidney during molecular latency."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	7966561	Structure and function of the murine cytomegalovirus sgg1 gene: a determinant of viral growth in salivary gland acinar cells.	"The salivary gland has long been recognized as an important target organ for cytomegalovirus replication in the infected host. A viral gene, denoted sgg1, plays an important role for replication in the salivary gland even though it is dispensable for growth in other organs or in cultured cells. The nucleotide sequence of this gene and of cDNA clones representing two spliced transcripts (1.5 and 1.8 kb in size) has been determined. The more abundant 1.5-kb transcript contains a 312-amino-acid (aa) open reading frame (ORF) and encodes the corresponding 37-kDa protein (Sgg1) when expressed in transfected COS-7 cells. The 1.8-kb transcript initiates upstream of the 1.5-kb transcript and contains a 108-aa ORF in addition to the 312-aa ORF. This longer cDNA also encodes the 37-kDa protein Sgg1, although at lower abundance than the 1.5-kb cDNA. Sgg1 localizes to the cytoplasm of COS-7 cells, which is consistent with the predicted structural characteristics of the 312-aa ORF: a type 1 integral membrane protein. During viral infection, expression of both sgg1 transcripts is highest at early times (8 to 12 h) after infection; only the 1.5-kb transcript is present, at low levels, late in infection. A recombinant virus, RM868, carrying a lacZ-gpt insertion within sgg1, fails to express Sgg1 protein and exhibits reduced growth in the salivary gland. RM868 retains the capacity to disseminate in the infected mouse and to enter serous acinar cells, although it fails to replicate efficiently in this cell type. These results suggest that sgg1 is critical for high levels of viral replication in the salivary gland."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	7966565	Identification and expression of a murine cytomegalovirus early gene coding for an Fc receptor.	"Several herpesviruses, including cytomegalovirus, induce receptors for the Fc domain of murine immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. Viral genes coding for these receptors have been characterized only for alphaherpesviruses. In this report, we describe a new approach that led to the identification of an Fc receptor (FcR) of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The Fc fragment of IgG precipitated glycoproteins (gp) of 86 to 88 and 105 kDa from MCMV-infected cells. Deglycosylation by endoglycosidase F resulted in a protein with a molecular mass of 64 kDa. Injection of complete MCMV DNA or of DNA fragments, and the subsequent testing of cytoplasmic binding of IgG by immunofluorescence microscopy, was used to search for the coding region in the MCMV genome. The gene was located in the HindIII J fragment, map units 0.838 to 0.846, where an open reading frame of 1,707 nucleotides predicts a gp of 569 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 65 kDa. The sequence of this gp is related to those of the gE proteins of herpes simplex virus type 1 and varicella-zoster virus. The defined length of the mRNA, 1,838 nucleotides, was in agreement with that of a 1.9-kb RNA expressed throughout the replication cycle, starting at the early stages of infection. Expression of the gene fcr1 by recombinant vaccinia virus resulted in the synthesis of gp86/88 and gp105, each with FcR properties, and the correct identification of the gene encoding the FcR was confirmed by the DNA injection method."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8228576	Effect of ganciclovir on murine cytomegalovirus-induced reactivation of toxoplasma pneumonia.	"Active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection induces immunosuppression and predisposes to the development of life-threatening superinfections in immunocompromised patients. We have described a mouse model in which acute murine CMV (MCMV) infection reactivates previously dormant Toxoplasma gondii infection, manifested as pneumonia. To determine whether therapy with ganciclovir might prevent MCMV-induced reactivation of T. gondii pneumonia, we administered ganciclovir to mice starting 1 day before to 2 days after MCMV infection and continuing for 14 days. When ganciclovir was begun early (before, on the day of, or 1 day after MCMV infection), the severity of T. gondii pneumonia reactivated by MCMV was significantly reduced. However, when therapy was delayed, no beneficial effect of ganciclovir was observed and the severity of MCMV-induced reactivation of T. gondii pneumonia was comparable to that seen in untreated animals. We conclude that ganciclovir therapy can attenuate but not eliminate MCMV-induced reactivation of T. gondii pneumonia and that prophylactic or very early administration of the drug is necessary to achieve protection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8387257	Murine cytomegalovirus-inhibitory effects of ImuVert.	"ImuVert, a sterile preparation composed primarily of Serratia marcescens membrane vesicles and ribosomes, was significantly inhibitory to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections in BALB/c mice. Antiviral activity was manifested as increased survivor number and decreased recoverable virus titers in spleens, lungs and salivary glands. Treatments were intraperitoneal (i.p.) beginning 24 h pre, 4 h post- or 24 h post-virus inoculation and then repeated 4 days later. Doses of 5, 16 or 50 micrograms/mouse were effective; 160 micrograms/mouse, which caused host weight loss in toxicity controls, was not inhibitory to the infection. A single i.p. treatment of mice substantially augmented natural killer (NK) cell activity and increased total B-cells, while reducing total T- and T-helper cells. A late (48 h) decline in T-cell function and transient increases in B-cell function were observed in the treated animals. Serum interferon was not induced. Mice pretreated with anti-asialo GM1 antibody to reduce their NK cell populations, then infected with MCMV and treated with ImuVert were protected to the same degree as normal animals. Severe combined immunodeficient mice infected with MCMV and treated with ImuVert were not protected from the infection. These data suggest ImuVert to act by a mechanism other than NK cell activation in preventing MCMV infections."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8388900	Demonstration of developmental anomalies in mouse fetuses by transfer of murine cytomegalovirus DNA-injected eggs to surrogate mothers.	"To study the potential consequences of sperm-mediated sexual cytomegalovirus (CMV) transmission, an in vitro model of microinjection of murine CMV (MCMV) DNA into uninfected fertilized murine ova was used. After microinjected ova were cultured to blastocysts and transferred to pseudopregnant mice, the effect of the DNA on implantation and development was analyzed. At various times, the sites of implantation in the endometrium were examined. Reductions in litter size, fetal growth retardation, resorption of embryos, and fetal maldevelopment, which often involved the central nervous system, were observed. The presence of MCMV DNA sequences in DNA derived from fetuses was detected by the polymerase chain reaction followed by oligonucleotide hybridization. By in situ DNA-DNA cytohybridization and indirect immunofluorescence assays the viral sequences and antigens were localized primarily to the brain, salivary gland, and skin of maldeveloped fetuses. These results establish the potential consequences of sperm-mediated CMV transmission and induction of fetal anomalies."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8610016	A role for the proteasome regulator PA28alpha in antigen presentation.	"Cytotoxic T cells recognize viral proteins as peptide fragments which are produced in the cytosol and transported on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins to the cell surface. Viral peptides that meet the stringent binding characteristics of class I proteins are generated by the 20S proteasome. The interferon (IFN)-gamma-inducible activator of the 20S proteasome, PA28, strongly influences the proteasomal cleavage pattern in vitro. This led us to investigate whether changes in cellular levels of PA28 affect the efficiency of viral antigen processing. A mouse fibroblast line expressing the murine cytomegalovirus pp89 protein was transfected with either the human or murine gene encoding the PA28alpha subunit, which is sufficient to activate the peptide-hydrolysing activity of the 20S proteasome in vitro. Here we report that enhanced expression of PA28alpha at a level similar to that obtained after IFN-gamma induction resulted in a marked enhancement of recognition by pp89-specific cytotoxic T cells; the presentation of influenza nucleoprotein was also significantly improved. These results demonstrate a fundamental in vivo function for PA28alpha in antigen processing."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8612291	Cure of fibroblast monolayers from murine cytomegalovirus infection: phenotypic assessment of rat lymphoid cell population developed on fibroblast monolayers.	"Rat and mouse fibroblast monolayers were infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by 2 hr incubation to allow virus to penetrate the cells. Then lymph node cells (LNC) from rats infected with MCMV and from untreated rats were added together with human recombinant interleukin-2 (hrIL-2). Cytopathic plaques appeared within 2-3 days. In culture of fibroblasts only, 30-40 plaques per well progressed into confluent cytopathy within 6-8 days. In cultures with LNC syngeneic to fibroblasts, plaques appeared; however, the cytotoxic T lymphocyte population that developed and specific apoptotic fragmentation eliminated the cytomegalic cells in the plaques. The surrounding cells stretched to the area, the cytopathic plaques disappeared, and the monolayer resumed its uninfected texture. No plaque-forming units could be isolated from such cured cultures. In allogeneic combination there was no apoptotic target cell killing. However, in cultures stimulated by hrIL-2, plaque growth was arrested and the plaques remained rudimentary. Similarly, arrest of plaques was also obtained in cultures containing LNC from uninfected rats, but only if stimulated by hrIL-2. In mouse fibroblasts carrying the rat LNC, plaque growth was not arrested, and the culture developed into confluent cytopathy. Interferon (IFN)-gamma or -alpha,beta added 24 hr before and 2 hr after infection abolished plaque appearance or arrested growth. IFN-gamma appeared to be the most effective. Fluids harvested from cured cultures also protected from plaque development. Antibodies to IFN-gamma, but not to IFN-alpha,beta, neutralized this capacity in the culture fluids. It is concluded that IFN-gamma produced by the LNC played a major role in the cure of the fibroblast culture from MCMV infection. A mechanism of cell-mediated immunity operating in resolving virus infection is proposed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8812691	Function and Regulation of Natural Killer (NK) Cells during Viral Infections: Characterization of Responses in Vivo	"Although in vitro systems have provided important information about the composition and nature of various immune responses, understanding physiologically relevant function and regulation requires evaluating in vivo conditions. Two different models of acute viral infections have made possible the characterization of a variety of responses to these agents, including natural killer (NK) cell activation and regulation during infection; these are mouse infections with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). The results of our characterization of the NK cell responses elicited in these models and the methods used to dissect the regulation of these responses are reviewed here. Cytotoxicity, proliferation, and cytokine expression assays as well as flow cytometric analyses are used to characterize the in vivo responses. Both of the infections induce early NK cell cytotoxicity and blastogenesis. Infection with MCMV but not LCMV also induces NK cell production of the antiviral cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Antibodies, to mediate in vivo cell subset depletion or cytokine neutralization, and mice, genetically altered to have cell subset or cytokine deficiencies, are utilized to identify the regulatory pathways and mechanisms controlling endogenous NK cell responses to the infections. The major mediators of the regulation of NK cell function during viral infection of normal mice are IFN-alpha/beta and interleukin-12 but not interleukin-2. Furthermore, the induction of later T-cell responses contributes to the negative regulation of NK cells by promoting the production of inhibitory factors including biologically active transforming growth factors-beta. Thus, the study of immune responses to viral infections has provided and will continue to provide important insights into the characteristics of endogenous NK cell responses and the cells and factors that regulate these responses in vivo."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	8995678	Identification and characterization of a G protein-coupled receptor homolog encoded by murine cytomegalovirus.	"This report describes the identification of a murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) G protein-coupled receptor (GCR) homolog. This open reading frame (M33) is most closely related to, and collinear with, human cytomegalovirus UL33, and homologs are also present in human herpesvirus 6 and 7 (U12 for both viruses). Conserved counterparts in the sequenced alpha- or gammaherpesviruses have not been identified to date, suggesting that these genes encode proteins which are important for the biological characteristics of betaherpesviruses. We have detected transcripts for both UL33 and M33 as early as 3 or 4 h postinfection, and these reappear at late times. In addition, we have identified N-terminal splicing for both the UL33 and M33 RNA transcripts. For both open reading frames, splicing results in the introduction of amino acids which are highly conserved among known GCRs. To characterise the function of the M33 in the natural host, two independent MCMV recombinant viruses were prepared, each of which possesses an M33 open reading frame which has been disrupted with the beta-galactosidase gene. While the recombinant M33 null viruses showed no phenotypic differences in replication from wild-type MCMV in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts in vitro, they showed severely restricted growth in the salivary glands of infected mice. These data suggest that M33 plays an important role in vivo, in particular in the dissemination to or replication in the salivary gland, and provide the first evidence for the function of a viral GCR homolog in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	9380340	Antibody alone does not prevent experimental cytomegalovirus retinitis in mice with retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency (MAIDS).	"Passive-transfer studies were performed to assess the ability of antibody alone to reduce the frequency and/or severity of necrotizing retinitis caused by murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in C57BL/6 mice with retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS). Initial experiments showed a gradual decline in the ability of mice to initiate humoral immunity during the evolution of MAIDS so that neither MCMV-specific IgM nor IgG could be detected during late-stage MAIDS. Passively administered hyperimmune MCMV immunoglobulin, however, could be detected within the serum of mice with MAIDS for at least 9 days after intraperitoneal injection and protected these animals in preliminary experiments from systemic MCMV disease and death when administered 24 h prior to intraperitoneal challenge with a lethal dose of virus. Nonetheless, passive transfer of hyperimmune MCMV serum to mice with MAIDS failed to reduce intraocular MCMV titers, frequency of retinitis, or severity of retinitis when administered 24 h prior to subretinal MCMV inoculation. Whereas whole eyes of MAIDS animals that received normal mouse serum and were injected subretinally with MCMV had an ocular MCMV titer of 4.3 log10 and a frequency of retinitis of 89% (severity score = 55%), whole eyes of antibody-treated mice with MAIDS had an ocular MCMV titer of 4.3 log10 and a frequency of retinitis of 87% (severity score = 57 %). Passive transfer of a neutralizing MCMV-specific monoclonal antibody also failed to reduce the frequency or severity of MCMV retinitis when administered to mice with MAIDS prior to subretinal MCMV inoculation. Our findings suggest that antibody immunotherapy alone will not be effective therapeutically for cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with AIDS."	0

"We characterized liver-infiltrating leucocytes (LIL) from BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice 0-56 days after murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. Inflammation clears from C57BL/6 mice 4-5 weeks post infection (pi), but persists for several months in BALB/c mice. The LIL obtained were 60-80% Thy 1.2+ by flow cytometry. The percentage of CD8+ cells rose sharply in all mice 7 days pi, with little decrease in BALB/c mice by day 56. CD4-CD8-Thy 1.2+/TCR alpha beta + cells were more prevalent in LIL than lymph node cells (LNC) irrespective of MCMV infection, whilst infection increased the proportion of CD8+ L-selectin- LIL (but not LNC). LIL from both mouse strains demonstrated cytotoxic activity against YAC-1 cells, but only LIL from BALB/c mice proliferated spontaneously ex vivo 21 days pi, as measured by tritiated thymidine incorporation. BALB/c LIL produced IFN gamma and IgG2a 7-21 days pi, whilst IL-10 secretion was similar in both strains. Thus, persistent hepatitis in BALB/c mice is associated with activation and proliferation of intrahepatic leucocytes with some bias towards a Th1 response."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	10049820	Phenotypic and functional characterization of CD8(+) T cell clones specific for a mouse cytomegalovirus epitope.	"A series of CD8(+) T cell clones, specific for the IE1 epitope YPHFMPTNL, of the immediate-early protein 1 of the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) were generated in order to determine their protective activity against this infection and correlate their phenotypic markers with antiviral activity. We found that the adoptive transfer of three of these anti-MCMV CD8(+) T cell clones into irradiated naive mice resulted in protection against challenge, while another CD8(+) T cell clone, of the same specificity, failed to confer protection. The clones that conferred protection against lethal challenge reduced greatly viral replication in the lung and other organs of the mice. Using one of the protective anti-MCMV CD8(+) T cell clones we found that in order to be fully protective the cells had to be transferred to recipient mice no later than 1 day after MCMV challenge. The adoptive transfer of these CD8(+) T cell clones also protected CD4(+) T-cell-depleted mice. Phenotypic characterization of the anti-MCMV clones revealed that the nonprotective clone expressed very low levels of CD8 molecules and produced only small amounts of TNF-alpha upon antigenic stimulation. Most importantly, our current study demonstrates that this MHC class I-restricted IE1 epitope of MCMV is efficiently presented to CD8(+) T cell clones in vivo and further strengthens the possibility of the potential use of CD8(+) T cell clones as immunotherapeutic tools against cytomegalovirus-induced disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	10231757	Murine viruses in an island population of introduced house mice and endemic short-tailed mice in Western Australia.	"House mice (Mus domesticus) were recently introduced to Thevenard Island, off the northwest coast of Western Australia. This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M. domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. Pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M. domesticus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	10651067	Acute murine cytomegalovirus infection: a model for determining antiviral activity against CMV induced hepatitis.	"Acute intraperitoneal infection of weanling BALB/c mice with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) resulted in an inoculum titer-dependent weight loss, mortality and elevation of plasma transaminases (ALT: alanine transaminase and AST: aspartate transaminase). Three days post infection (p.i.) with 10(4.85) plaque forming units (pfu) there was 90% mortality with a mean death day p.i. of 4.1 +/- 0.2. Plasma levels of ALT and AST were elevated 24- and 15-fold, respectively. Organ titers of virus (log10 pfu/g tissue) were 6.16 in the liver, 6.05 in the spleen, 4.0-4.7 in the lung, heart, kidney and intestine and undetectable in the muscle and brain. Organ concentrations (units/g wet-weight) of ALT were highest in the liver, whilst for AST the highest levels were found in the heart. The concentrations of ALT but not AST were reduced (35-55%) in the infected liver; the concentrations of ALT and AST were not changed in other infected organs. There were excellent correlations (r > 0.95) between viral titers in the liver, increases of plasma ALT and depletion of liver ALT. HPMPC and ganciclovir administered either p.o. or s.c. reduced mortality, increases in plasma transaminases and viral burdens in the liver and prevented depletion of liver ALT. HPMPC was approximately 10-fold more potent than ganciclovir. These results strongly suggest that intraperitoneal infection of the BALB/c mouse with MCMV represents an animal model of CMV hepatitis that can be monitored by measuring plasma ALT."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	10817700	In vitro activities of methylenecyclopropane analogues of nucleosides and their phosphoralaninate prodrugs against cytomegalovirus and other herpesvirus infections.	"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection does not generally cause problems in the immunocompetent adult but can result in severe clinical disease in the fetus, neonate, and immunocompromised host. Ganciclovir (GCV), the agent currently used to treat most HCMV infections, has resulted in much therapeutic success; however, efficacy remains suboptimal. Therefore, there is still a need to develop new compounds for use against HCMV infections. In the present study, several Z- and E-series methylenecyclopropane analogues and their phosphoroalaninate prodrugs were tested initially for activity against HCMV, strain AD169, and murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) in vitro. Many were found to exhibit efficacy comparable to that of GCV against HCMV in plaque assays and were active against MCMV as well. The compounds were also tested for efficacy against herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus, and Epstein-Barr virus, and some had levels of activity that were comparable to that of acyclovir. In addition, the compounds synguanol (QYL-438) and 2-amino-6-cyclopropylamino analogue (QYL-769) were chosen for further evaluation and were found to be effective against additional laboratory and clinical isolates of HCMV and GCV-resistant isolates. QYL-438 and QYL-769 were found to be nontoxic in human and mouse fibroblasts and were considerably less toxic than GCV in granulocyte macrophage CFUs and erythroid burst-forming units. These results provide evidence for the high activity of some of these methylenecyclopropane analogues against various herpesviruses, particularly HCMV, in tissue culture and suggest that further evaluation is warranted to determine their potential for use in future clinical studies."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	11090153	Expression of an altered ribonucleotide reductase activity associated with the replication of murine cytomegalovirus in quiescent fibroblasts.	"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is an essential enzyme for the de novo synthesis of both cellular and viral DNA and catalyzes the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates into the corresponding deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates. The enzyme consists of two nonidentical subunits, termed R1 and R2, whose expression is very low in resting cells and maximal in S-phase cells. Here we show that murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) replication depends on ribonucleotide reduction since it is prevented by the RNR inhibitor hydroxyurea. MCMV infection of quiescent fibroblasts markedly induces both mRNA and protein corresponding to the cellular R2 subunit, whereas expression of the cellular R1 subunit does not appear to be up-regulated. The increase in R2 gene expression is due to an increase in gene transcription, since the activity of a reporter gene driven by the mouse R2 promoter is induced following virus infection. Cotransfection experiments revealed that expression of the viral immediate-early 1 protein was sufficient to mediate the increase in R2 promoter activity. It was found that the viral gene M45, encoding a putative homologue of the R1 subunit, is expressed 24 and 48 h after infection. Meanwhile, we observed an expansion of the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pool between 24 and 48 h after infection; however, neither CDP reduction nor viral replication was inhibited by treatment with 10 mM thymidine. These findings indicate the induction of an RNR activity with an altered allosteric regulation compared to the mouse RNR following MCMV infection and suggest that the virus R1 homologue may complex with the induced cellular R2 protein to reconstitute a new RNR activity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	11559829	Murine cytomegalovirus CC chemokine homolog MCK-2 (m131-129) is a determinant of dissemination that increases inflammation at initial sites of infection.	"The murine cytomegalovirus CC chemokine homolog MCK-2 (m131-129) is an important determinant of dissemination during primary infection. Reduced peak levels of viremia at day 5 were followed by reduced levels of virus in salivary glands starting at day 7 when mck insertion (RM461) and point (RM4511) mutants were compared to mck-expressing viruses. A dramatic MCK-2-enhanced inflammation occurred at the inoculation site over the first few days of infection, preceding viremia. The data further reinforce the role of MCK-2 as a proinflammatory signal that recruits leukocytes to increase the efficiency of viral dissemination in the host."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	11600246	Susceptibility of thermally injured mice to cytomegalovirus infection.	"Thermally injured patients are very susceptible to infection with cytomegaloviruses. In this study a role of burn-associated type 2 T cell responses on the cytomegalovirus infection was examined in a mouse model of thermal injury. A predominance of type 2 T cell responses in splenic lymphocytes of thermally injured mice has been previously demonstrated. SCID mice inoculated with splenic T cells from thermally injured mice were susceptible to infection with a small amount (5 PFU/mouse) of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Conversely, SCID mice inoculated with splenic T cells from normal mice were resistant to the same infection. High levels of IL-4 and IL-10, but not IFN-gamma and IL-2, were detected in sera of thermally injured mice (TI-mice) infected with MCMV when those were compared with sera of normal mice infected with MCMV. IL-4 and IL-10 (type 2 cytokines) were produced by splenic T cells from MCMV-infected TI-mice, when they were stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 mAb. Type 1 cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-2), however, were not produced by these T cells after the same stimulation. In contrast, splenic T cells from MCMV-infected normal mice produced type 1 cytokines by the stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb. These results suggest that the susceptibility of mice to MCMV infection is markedly influenced by burn-associated type 2 T cell responses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	11678903	Cytomegalovirus infection and proinflammatory cytokine activation modulate the surface immune determinant expression and immunogenicity of cultured murine extrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells.	"Murine extrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells (MEBEC) were isolated from extrahepatic bile ducts of BALB/c mice and established in primary culture. The epithelial origin was confirmed by positive cytokeratin 19 staining for these cells and the presence of microvilli and tight junctions under electron microscopy. By immunofluorescent staining with monoclonal antibodies and flow-cytometric analysis, MEBEC in culture constitutively express low levels of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, class I and class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens. The expression of ICAM-1 was significantly increased by interferon gamma (INF-gamma) or tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation. Class I and class II antigen expression were significantly enhanced by INF-gamma and in vitro murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection. MEBEC infected with MCMV revealed a progressive cytopathic effect. MEBEC activated by INF-gamma or infected by MCMV induced a low but significant proliferation of allogeneic T cells and displayed a significant decrease in the absorbance at O.D. 550 nm in a microtitre tetrazolium assay after these treated cells were co-cultured with allogeneic T cells. These results suggest that following the up-regulation of surface MHC antigen and adhesion molecule expression with cytokines or MCMV, the MEBEC can function as antigen-presenting cells and initiate T-cell proliferation, which in turn trigger the recognition of MEBEC by effector T-cell-mediated cytotoxic responses. These findings may be implicated in the pathogenesis of virally induced, immune-mediated extrahepatic bile duct damage disorders."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	12927309	HPMPC therapy of MCMV-induced retinal disease in the SCID mouse measured by electroretinography, a non-invasive technique.	"The purpose of these studies was to investigate the use of non-invasive electroretinography for the evaluation of retinal disease and its treatment in an ocular murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) disease model. While under anesthesia, 10(2.6)plaque forming units (pfu) of salivary gland passaged, Smith strain MCMV was injected in the anterior chamber of 6- to 8-week-old severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. At various times post-inoculation, bright-flash scotopic electroretinogram, viral titer, and histology were obtained from the injected eye. Antiviral therapy was tested using 0.1 and 5mg/kg/day subcutaneous injections of HPMPC (Cidofovir) once daily for 5 consecutive days. In infected animals, the a- and b-waves of the electroretinographic (ERG) signal were significantly reduced as of 10 days post-inoculation when compared to control animals. Therapy with HPMPC 0.1mg/kg/day subcutaneously (s.c.) once daily for 5 consecutive days was able to delay the decrease in ERG wave amplitude and inhibit viral replication, whereas 5mg/kg/day s.c. significantly protected the ERG, completely inhibited viral replication, and maintained ocular viral titer below the limit of detection for up to 17 days post-infection. The reduction of ERG activity during progression of retinal disease correlated well with reduction of disease pathology. ERG recording represents a valuable non-invasive technique to measure the progression of the retinal disease induced by MCMV and the efficacy of antiviral treatment in the ocular MCMV disease model."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	14694106	Neutrality of the canonical NF-kappaB-dependent pathway for human and murine cytomegalovirus transcription and replication in vitro.	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is known to rapidly induce activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) after infection of fibroblast and macrophage cells. NF-kappaB response elements are present in the enhancer region of the CMV major immediate-early promoter (MIEP), and activity of the MIEP is strongly upregulated by NF-kappaB in transient-transfection assays. Here we investigate whether the NF-kappaB-dependent pathway is required for initiating or potentiating human and murine CMV replication in vitro. We show that expression of a dominant negative mutant of the inhibitor of NF-kappaB-alpha (IkappaBalphaM) does not alter the replication kinetics of human or mouse CMV in cultured cells. In addition, mouse embryo fibroblasts genetically deficient for p65/RelA actually showed elevated levels of MCMV replication. Mutation of all NF-kappaB response elements within the enhancer of the MIEP in a recombinant mouse CMV containing the human MIEP (hMCMV-ES), which we have previously shown to replicate in murine fibroblasts with kinetics equivalent to that of wild-type mouse CMV, did not negatively affect replication in fibroblasts. Taken together, these data show that, for CMV replication in cultured fibroblasts activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway and binding of NF-kappaB to the MIEP are dispensable, and in the case of p65 may even interfere, thus uncovering a previously unrecognized level of complexity in the host regulatory network governing MIE gene expression in the context of a viral infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	14757699	Murine cytomegalovirus infection increases aortic expression of proatherosclerotic genes.	"The possible etiologic role of infection in cardiovascular disease is still debated. Having previously demonstrated that murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection of apolipoprotein (apo) E-/- mice increases atherosclerotic lesion size, we determined if MCMV infection produces proatherogenic changes in aortic gene expression. Additionally, in cholesterol-fed C57BL/6J mice, we examined the effects of MCMV infection on aortic lesion area., C57BL/6J apoE-/- and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were infected with MCMV. At various time points, aortas were collected and pooled. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix murine chips or analyzed for specific gene expression using TaqMan reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Data from infected and uninfected mice were compared. A separate group of cholesterol-fed C57BL/6J mice were infected with MCMV, and lesion area in the aortic sinus was assessed using oil red O staining. Acute MCMV infection altered aortic expression of atherogenic genes in young apoE-/- and C57BL/6J mice-specifically, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, monokine induced by interferon-gamma, and interferon-gamma inducible protein 10. Acute infection in adult 9-month-old apoE-/- mice with well-established lesions increased aortic expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Atherosclerotic lesion area in cholesterol-fed C57BL/6J mice was increased after infection with MCMV., MCMV infection significantly increases atherosclerotic lesion area and aortic expression of atherogenic genes. These infection-induced effects indicate mechanisms by which cytomegalovirus may contribute to atherosclerotic disease initiation and progression and to the precipitation of clinical events. These results additionally add to data compatible with the concept that infection does play an important role in atherosclerotic disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	15016952	Assessment of contraceptive vaccines based on recombinant mouse sperm protein PH20.	"Mouse PH20 (mPH20), the mouse homologue to guinea pig hyaluronidase protein PH20 (gpPH20), was used to produce contraceptive vaccines that target both sexes of mice. Previously, immunization with a female gamete antigen (the zona pellucida subunit 3 protein) delivered in a recombinant murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), or as a purified recombinant protein, has been shown to induce infertility in female mice. There is evidence, however, that sperm protein antigens could provide broader contraceptive coverage by affecting both males and females, and the most promising has been gpPH20 when tested in a guinea pig model. Mice were therefore either inoculated with a recombinant MCMV expressing mPH20 or immunized directly with purified recombinant mPH20 protein fused to maltose-binding protein. Mice treated with either vaccine formulation developed serum antibodies that cross-reacted to a protein band of 55 kDa corresponding to mPH20 in Western blots of mouse sperm. However, there was no significant reduction in the fertility of males or females compared with control animals with either formulation. We conclude from our data that recombinant mPH20 is not a useful antigen for inclusion in immunocontraceptive vaccines that target mice."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 1	15047841	The ribonucleotide reductase R1 homolog of murine cytomegalovirus is not a functional enzyme subunit but is required for pathogenesis.	"Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the key enzyme in the biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotides. Alpha- and gammaherpesviruses express a functional enzyme, since they code for both the R1 and the R2 subunits. By contrast, betaherpesviruses contain an open reading frame (ORF) with homology to R1, but an ORF for R2 is absent, suggesting that they do not express a functional RNR. The M45 protein of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) exhibits the sequence features of a class Ia RNR R1 subunit but lacks certain amino acid residues believed to be critical for enzymatic function. It starts to be expressed independently upon the onset of viral DNA synthesis at 12 h after infection and accumulates at later times in the cytoplasm of the infected cells. Moreover, it is associated with the virion particle. To investigate direct involvement of the virally encoded R1 subunit in ribonucleotide reduction, recombinant M45 was tested in enzyme activity assays together with cellular R1 and R2. The results indicate that M45 neither is a functional equivalent of an R1 subunit nor affects the activity or the allosteric control of the mouse enzyme. To replicate in quiescent cells, MCMV induces the expression and activity of the cellular RNR. Mutant viruses in which the M45 gene has been inactivated are avirulent in immunodeficient SCID mice and fail to replicate in their target organs. These results suggest that M45 has evolved a new function that is indispensable for virus replication and pathogenesis in vivo."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	12627394	Cloning of herpesviral genomes as bacterial artificial chromosomes.	"Herpesviruses, which are important pathogens for both animals and humans, have large and complex genomes with a coding capacity for up to 225 open reading frames (ORFs). Due to the large genome size and the slow replication kinetics in vitro of some herpesviruses, mutagenesis of viral genes in the context of the viral genome by conventional recombination methods in cell culture has been difficult. Given that mutagenesis of viral genes is the basic strategy to investigate function, many of the herpesvirus ORFs could not be defined functionally. Recently, a completely new approach for the construction of herpesvirus mutants has been developed, based on cloning of the virus genome as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) in E. coli. This technique allows the maintenance of viral genomes as a plasmid in E. coli and the reconstitution of viral progeny by transfection of the BAC plasmid into eukaryotic cells. Any genetic modification of the viral genome in E. coli using prokaryotic recombination proteins is possible, thereby allowing the generation of mutant viruses and facilitating the analysis of herpesvirus genomes cloned as infectious BACs. In this review, we describe the principle of cloning a viral genome as a BAC using murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68), a mouse model for gammaherpesvirus infections, as an example."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	12966553	Mice deficient in the X-linked lymphoproliferative disease gene sap exhibit increased susceptibility to murine gammaherpesvirus-68 and hypo-gammaglobulinemia.	"X-linked lymphoproliferative disease is characterized by immune dysregulation and uncontrolled lymphoproliferation on exposure to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This disease has been attributed to mutations in the SAP gene (also denominated as SH2D1A or DSHP). To delineate the role of SAP in the pathophysiology of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease, a strain of sap-deficient mice has been generated by deleting exon 2 of the gene. After infection with murine gammaherpesvirus-68, which is homologous to EBV, the mutant mice exhibit more vigorous CD8+ T cell proliferation and more disseminated lymphocyte infiltration compared to their wild-type littermates. Chronic tissue damage and hemophagocytosis were evident in sap-deficient mice but not in their wild-type littermates. Concordantly, murine gammaherpesvirus-68 reactivation was observed in sap-deficient mice, indicating an impaired control of the virus. Notably, IgE deficiency and decreased serum IgG level were observed in mutant mice prior to and after murine gammaherpesvirus-68 infection, which reproduces hypo-gammaglobulinemia in X-linked lymphoproliferative disease patients. This mouse model will therefore be a useful tool for dissecting the various phenotypes of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	16014911	Role of B-cell proliferation in the establishment of gammaherpesvirus latency.	"Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) provides a tractable small animal model with which to study the mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of latency by gammaherpesviruses. Similar to the human gammaherpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), gammaHV68 establishes and maintains latency in the memory B-cell compartment following intranasal infection. Here we have sought to determine whether, like EBV infection, gammaHV68 infection in vivo is associated with B-cell proliferation during the establishment of chronic infection. We show that gammaHV68 infection leads to significant splenic B-cell proliferation as late as day 42 postinfection. Notably, gammaHV68 latency was found predominantly in the proliferating B-cell population in the spleen on both days 16 and 42 postinfection. Furthermore, virus reactivation upon ex vivo culture was heavily biased toward the proliferating B-cell population. DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is a critical maintenance methyltransferase which, during DNA replication, maintains the DNA methylation patterns of the cellular genome, a process that is essential for the survival of proliferating cells. To assess whether the establishment of gammaHV68 latency requires B-cell proliferation, we characterized infections of conditional Dnmt1 knockout mice by utilizing a recombinant gammaHV68 that expresses Cre-recombinase (gammaHV68-Cre). In C57BL/6 mice, the gammaHV68-Cre virus exhibited normal acute virus replication in the lungs as well as normal establishment and reactivation from latency. Furthermore, the gammaHV68-Cre virus also replicated normally during the acute phase of infection in the lungs of Dnmt1 conditional mice. However, deletion of the Dnmt1 alleles from gammaHV68-infected cells in vivo led to a severe ablation of viral latency, as assessed on both days 16 and 42 postinfection. Thus, the studies provide direct evidence that the proliferation of latently infected B cells is critical for the establishment of chronic gammaHV68 infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	17082648	The chemokine decoy receptor M3 blocks CC chemokine ligand 2 and CXC chemokine ligand 13 function in vivo.	"Chemokines and their receptors play a key role in immune homeostasis regulating leukocyte migration, differentiation, and function. Viruses have acquired and optimized molecules that interact with the chemokine system. These virus-encoded molecules promote cell entry, facilitate dissemination of infected cells, and enable the virus to evade the immune response. One such molecule in the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 genome is the M3 gene, which encodes a secreted 44-kDa protein that binds with high affinity to certain murine and human chemokines and blocks chemokine signaling in vitro. To test the hypothesis that M3 directly interferes with diverse chemokines in vivo, we examined the interaction of M3 with CCL2 and CXCL13 expressed in the pancreas of transgenic mice. CCL2 expression in the pancreas promoted recruitment of monocytes and dendritic cells; CXCL13 promoted recruitment of B and T lymphocytes. Coexpression of M3 in the pancreas blocked cellular recruitment induced by both CCL2 and CXCL13. These results define M3 as multichemokine blocker and demonstrate its use as a powerful tool to analyze chemokine biology."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	17372021	The chemokine binding protein M3 prevents diabetes induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin.	"Multiple injections of low-dose streptozotocin (MLDS) induce lymphocytic insulitis and diabetes in rodents. To test whether the influx of inflammatory cells was associated with changes in the expression of chemokines, we measured the expression of all known chemokine ligands by real-time quantitative PCR in isolated islets. With the exception of CCL20 and CCL19, chemokines were not significantly expressed in islets from wild-type mice before MLDS treatment. Ten days after treatment, the expression of several chemokines, including CXCL9, CCL1, CXCL10, and CCL21, was dramatically up-regulated. The expression of CCL1, CXCL9, and CCL21 protein was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and was mostly associated with the infiltrating cells. The mouse herpesvirus 68-encoded chemokine decoy receptor M3 can broadly engage these chemokines with high affinity. To test whether a blockade of chemokine function would alter the onset or magnitude of insulitis and diabetes, we used transgenic mice expressing M3 in beta cells (rat insulin promoter (RIP)-M3 mice). RIP-M3 mice were normoglycemic and responded normally to glucose challenge but were remarkably resistant to diabetes induced by MLDS. Islets from MLDS-treated RIP-M3 mice had fewer inflammatory cells and expressed lower levels of chemokines than those from MLDS-treated controls. The role of M3 in chemokine blockade during insulitis was further supported by in vitro experiments demonstrating that multiple chemokines up-regulated during islet inflammation are high-affinity M3 ligands that can be simultaneously sequestered. These results implicate chemokines as key mediators of insulitis and suggest that their blockade may represent a novel strategy to prevent insulitis and islet destruction."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	19214440	Age-dependent pathogenesis of murine gammaherpesvirus 68 infection of the central nervous system.	"Gammaherpesvirus infection of the central nervous system (CNS) has been linked to various neurological diseases, including meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the interactions between the virus and the CNS in vitro or in vivo. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68 or (gamma)HV-68) is genetically related and biologically similar to human gammaherpesviruses, thereby providing a tractable animal model system in which to study both viral pathogenesis and replication. In the present study, we show the successful infection of cultured neuronal cells, microglia, and astrocytes with MHV-68 to various extents. Upon intracerebroventricular injection of a recombinant virus (MHV-68/LacZ) into 4-5-week-old and 9-10-week-old mice, the 4-5-week-old mice displayed high mortality within 5-7 days, while the majority of the 9-10-week-old mice survived until the end of the experimental period. Until a peak at 3-4 days post-infection, viral DNA replication and gene expression were similar in the brains of both mouse groups, but only the 9-10-week-old mice were able to subdue viral DNA replication and gene expression after 5 days post-infection. Pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 6 were highly induced in the brains of the 4-5-week-old mice, suggesting their possible contributions as neurotoxic factors in the agedependent control of MHV-68 replication of the CNS."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	19889763	Blimp-1-dependent plasma cell differentiation is required for efficient maintenance of murine gammaherpesvirus latency and antiviral antibody responses.	"Recent evidence from the study of Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus supports a model in which terminal differentiation of B cells to plasma cells leads to virus reactivation. Here we address the role of Blimp-1, the master transcriptional regulator of plasma cell differentiation, in murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) latency and reactivation. Blimp-1 expression in infected cells was dispensable for acute virus replication in the lung following intranasal inoculation and in the spleen following intraperitoneal inoculation with MHV68. However, we observed a role for Blimp-1 in both the establishment of latency and reactivation from latency in vivo. Additionally, plasma cell-deficient mice also exhibited a significant defect in the establishment of latency in the spleen, as well as reactivation from latency, similar to mice that lacked Blimp-1 only in MHV68-infected cells. In the absence of plasma cells, MHV68 infection failed to elicit a strong germinal center response and fewer B cells in the germinal center were MHV68 infected. Notably, the absence of a functional Blimp-1 gene only in MHV68-infected cells led to a decrease in both B-cell and CD4(+) T-cell responses during the establishment of latency. Finally, Blimp-1 expression in infected cells played a critical role in the maintenance of both MHV68 latency in the spleen and antibody responses to MHV68. Together, these studies support a model wherein episodic Blimp-1-mediated plasma cell differentiation leads to MHV68 reactivation, which serves to both renew the latency reservoirs and stimulate long-lived plasma cells to secrete virus-specific antibody."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	20130062	Pathogenesis of a model gammaherpesvirus in a natural host.	"Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infection of laboratory mice (Mus musculus) is an established model of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis. The fact that M. musculus is not a host in the wild prompted us to reassess MHV-68 infection in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), a natural host. Here, we report significant differences in MHV-68 infection in the two species: (i) following intranasal inoculation, MHV-68 replicated in the lungs of wood mice to levels approximately 3 log units lower than in BALB/c mice; (ii) in BALB/c mice, virus replication in alveolar epithelial cells was accompanied by a diffuse, T-cell-dominated interstitial pneumonitis, whereas in wood mice it was restricted to focal granulomatous infiltrations; (iii) within wood mice, latently infected lymphocytes were abundant in inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue that was not apparent in BALB/c mice; (iv) splenic latency was established in both species, but well-delineated secondary follicles with germinal centers were present in wood mice, while only poorly delineated follicles were seen in BALB/c mice; and, perhaps as a consequence, (v) production of neutralizing antibody was significantly higher in wood mice. These differences highlight the value of this animal model in the study of MHV-68 pathogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murid gammaherpesvirus 4	20493722	Interleukin-27 expression following infection with the murine gammaherpesvirus 68.	"IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of p28 and Epstein Barr virus induced gene 3 (Ebi3) protein subunits. In the present study, we questioned whether murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (HV-68) could induce expression of Ebi3, p28, and IL-27 in this mouse model of an EBV-like infection. Cultured macrophages and dendritic cells exposed to HV-68 upregulated p28 mRNA expression and increased secretion of the p28 and IL-27 (p28+Ebi3) proteins. B220(+) and CD11b(+) cells also upregulated p28 mRNA expression following in vivo infection with this virus. Surprisingly, no significant increases in p28 or IL-27 protein production were observed in vivo during the acute or mononucleosis phases of the disease. The possibility that HV-68-induced upregulation of p28 mRNA expression primed cells for IL-27 secretion was suggested by the ability of a TLR4 agonist to augment cytokine production. When cultured macrophages and dendritic cells were exposed to virus plus a suboptimal dose of LPS, increased levels of p28 protein expression were observed. More importantly, when latently infected mice were challenged with a sublethal dose of LPS, augmented p28 and IL-27 protein production occurred. Using a model of sepsis, mice latently infected with HV-68 had exaggerated p28 protein production when compared to mice that were singularly infected or subjected to cecal ligation and puncture. Taken together, these studies define expression of HV-68 induced IL-27, and suggest that mice latently infected with this gammaherpesvirus will have exaggerated responses when confronted with other stimuli capable of inducing this member of the IL-12 family of cytokines."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	135262	Congenic strains of mice susceptible and resistant to mouse hepatitis virus.	"A congenic strain of C3HSS mice, which is histocompatible with C3H mice but differs from them in susceptibility to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), has been developed by introducing the gene for susceptibility to the MHV-PRI virus from the PRI mice. This was accomplished by continual back-crossing of the hybrids to the C3H mice, but at the same time by selection of susceptibility by use of macrophage culture tests. After 20 back-crosses, a strain homozygous for susceptibility was produced by brother-sister mating of individual mice whose potential for carrying the recessive gene for resistance was tested in progeny. Since the original choice of mice for breeding was based on in vitro macrophage susceptibility, and since highly susceptible mice were developed on the same basis, it seems evident that macrophage susceptibility is an integral aspect of mouse susceptibility. The continued production of almost 50% susceptible mice in the back-crosses is further evidence of the dominant one-locus explanation of genetic susceptibility to this agent. Incomplete penetrance may also be present in 8 and 9 week old mice of the C3HSS strain since there was a sharp decrease in susceptibility of these mice even though their macrophages in culture maintained full susceptibility."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	168262	Immunopathology of mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection. III. Clinical and virologic observation of a persistent viral infection.	"Three types of viral sensitivity were observed in various mouse strains upon MHV3 infection: resistance, full susceptibility, and semisusceptibility. In the latter type, seen in several inbred strains including C3H, approximately 50% of the adult injected animals resisted to the acute disease. Most of the surviving mice, however, developed a chronic disease with a wasting syndrome and occurrence of paralysis. The chronic period of the disease was characterized by a persistent viral infection, since MHV3 virus was recovered from brain, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes throughout the evolution in most of the animals. In addition, a correlation was observed between the clinical evolution and the titer of virus tested 4 days after infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	175127	Macrophages genetically resistant to mouse hepatitis virus converted in vitro to susceptible macrophages.	"Genetic resistance to mouse hepatitis, which resides largely in the macrophages of resistant C3H mice, may be altered by exposing the cells in vitro to fluid from allogeneic mixed lymphocytes. A 1,000-fold increase in susceptibility was produced in these genetically resistant cells by exposure to this fluid. This presumed lymphokine was effective without producing any change in host adaption of the virus."	0

mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	180312	Response of nude mice to a mouse hepatitis virus isolated from a wasting nude mouse.	"Chronic active hepatitis was produced in nude mice after inoculation with a mouse hepatitis virus from a natural nude case which was incapable of causing fatal infection in haired heterozygous mice without cortisone. Survival time of infected nude mice varied greatly from 1 to 10 weeks after the inoculation. Degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, apparition of small and megalocytic hepatocytes, and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells with fibrosis, were most remarkable in those which died 3 weeks or more after inoculation. No such severe hepatic lesions were recognized in heterozygous haired litter-mates after inoculation of the same virus. Necrotic lesions with poor inflammatory reactions were seen in the brain of all infected and dead nude mice, while some cerebral lesions with apparent perivascular infiltration were detected in heterozygous ones only at early stage of infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	194073	Age-dependent response of mice to a mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-S.	"To a mouse hepatitis virus strain MHV-S, 4 week-old ICR mice were shown to be fully resistant irrespective of route and dose of inoculation, and fatal infection was produced only with cortisone treatment. Two-week-old mice also showed high resistance to MHV-S except for after intracerebral inoculation, and 60% of infected mice died. Mice aged 1 week or less, however, died after intracerebral, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and intranasal inoculation, while some of them survived after peroral inoculation. Between mice aged 4 weeks and those aged 1 week or less, there was a significant difference in viral growth in the liver after intranasal inoculation, whereas almost the same degree of viral multiplication was seen in the brain of both age groups. Such age-dependent difference in susceptibility to a low-virulent mouse hepatitis virus especially after nasal inoculation is discussed in relation to natural infection in mouse breeding colonies."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	195136	Naturally occurring mouse hepatitis virus infection in the nude mouse.	"A group of athymic nude mice developed an unusual chronic wasting disease within 1-3 months after their arrival into the laboratory. Affected nude mice had severe, acute-to-chronic, active hepatitis with multinucleated giant hepatocytes and fibrosis. Vascular and central nervous system lesions were frequently present, giant cell peritonitis, ascites, and multinucleated giant cells in the intestinal epithelial villi were less frequently observed. Mouse hepatitis virus was isolated from the livers of three mice with lesions. The virus, when inoculated into nude mice, produced lesions similar to those observed in the natural outbreak."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	201568	Respiratory infection in mice with sialodacryoadenitis virus, a coronavirus of rats.	"Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), a coronavirus of rats, evoked both serum neutralization and complement fixation antibody responses when inoculated intranasally in mice. Weanling gnotobiotic CD-1 mice inoculated intranasally with 10(3.0) mean tissue culture infective doses of SDAV remained asymptomatic. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx, trachea, and lung from day 2 to day 7. Viral antigen was readily detected by indirect immunofluorescence in the lung but rarely in the nasopharynx. Infected mice developed interstitial pneumonia. Susceptible mice contact exposed to experimentally infected mice developed antibody to SDAV. Epizootiological studies indicated that retired breeder mice can have complement-fixing antibody to SDAV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in the absence of MHV infection. These studies show that SDAV is infectious for mice and can be a pathogen for the respiratory system. Thus, SDAV infection of mice may be responsible for spurious seroconversions to MHV."	0

"Kirsten murine sarcoma virus-transformed, nonproducer BALB3T3 (K-BALB) cells were persistently infected with mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-S. The cultures developed plaques after infection with murine leukemia viruses. If the murine leukemia virus-infected cultures were further submitted to the UV-XC assay, comparable numbers of XC plaques were obtained.

mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	224229	Pathology of diarrhea due to mouse hepatitis virus in the infant mouse.	"Two-day-old mice were inoculated orally with a mouse hepatitis virus which had been isolated from a suckling mouse with fatal diarrhea, and a systemic infection was shown to be established, though enterotropism of the isolate was evident. Significant viral growth and syncytium forming lesions were first detectable in the intestines at day 2 postinoculation, followed by the development of focal necrotic hepatitis. The virus titer in both liver and intestine attained maximum levels at days 4 to 5. Death occurred at day 5 or later, and 60 to 100% mice died during the first 2 weeks of life. Before death, some mice showed neurologic signs with high titered viruses recovered from the brain. The necrotizing lesions were also demonstrated in the lung and lymphoid organs."	0

"After intranasal inoculation with a neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus, JHM strain, suckling mice less than 2 weeks of age died in 4 or 5 days postinoculation, while those 3 weeks or more of age survived. In the brain lesions of mice 8 days or less of age, there appeared two different types of multinucleated giant cells. One of them which was irregular in shape with many virus particles, appeared mostly in the subependymal or perivascular areas after 72 h postinoculation and it seemed to have resulted from a fusion of two or more infected macrophages. The other type of giant cells which was oval in shape with a small number of virus particles, appeared within degenerative lesions at 96 h postinoculation. It consisted of two morphologically different parts and seemed to be a complex of infected neurons and reacting macrophages. In the cerebral lesions of mice 2 to 4 weeks of age, only the former type of giant cells appeared."	0

"Two species of primates, Owl and African green monkeys, were inoculated intracerebrally with either the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus JHM or the putative multiple sclerosis brain coronavirus isolate SD. These viruses caused an acute to subacute panencephalitis and/or demyelination in the infected animals. The course of pathogenesis and sites of detected viral RNA and antigen was dependent both on animal species and virus strain but the results clearly showed that these viruses replicated and disseminated in the central nervous system (CNS) of these primates. This study suggests that human CNS may be susceptible to coronavirus infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1316465	Identification and characterization of a coronavirus packaging signal.	"Previously, a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genomic sequence necessary for defective interfering (DI) RNA packaging into MHV particles (packaging signal) was mapped to within a region of 1,480 nucleotides in the MHV polymerase gene by comparison of two DI RNAs. One of these, DIssF, is 3.6 kb in size and exhibits efficient packaging, whereas the other, DIssE, which is 2.3 kb, does not. For more precise mapping, a series of mutant DIssF RNAs with deletions within this 1,480-nucleotide region were constructed. After transfection of in vitro-synthesized mutant DI RNA in MHV-infected cells, the virus product was passaged several times. The efficiency of DI RNA packaging into MHV virions was then estimated by viral homologous interference activity and by analysis of intracellular virus-specific RNAs and virion RNA. The results indicated that an area of 190 nucleotides was necessary for packaging. A computer-generated secondary structural analysis of the A59 and JHM strains of MHV demonstrated that within this 190-nucleotide region a stable stem-loop of 69 nucleotides was common between the two viruses. A DIssE-derived DI DNA which had these 69 nucleotides inserted into the DIssE sequence demonstrated efficient DI RNA packaging. Site-directed mutagenic analysis showed that of these 69 nucleotides, the minimum sequence of the packaging signal was 61 nucleotides and that destruction of the secondary structure abolished packaging ability. These studies demonstrated that an MHV packaging signal was present within the 61 nucleotides, which are located on MHV genomic RNA 1,381 to 1,441 nucleotides upstream of the 3' end of gene 1."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1322650	Localization of an RNA-binding domain in the nucleocapsid protein of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus.	"The interaction between the nucleocapsid (N) protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and RNA was studied in an effort to define portions of the N molecule that participate in binding to RNA. N mRNAs transcribed from SP6 and T7 vectors were translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Analysis of synthesized N protein in a nondenaturing gel system showed that it bound in vitro to an endogenous RNA in the reticulocyte lysate but not to its own mRNA. A set of deletion mutants was constructed in order to localize the RNA-binding activity of the N protein. It was found that removal of as much as 135 amino-terminal or 57 carboxy-terminal amino acids from the molecule had little or no effect on RNA binding. Moreover, deletion mutants lacking both termini still retained RNA-binding ability. By contrast, internal deletions or truncations extending beyond these two limits effectively abolished RNA binding by N protein. Thus, the RNA-binding region of N has been mapped to the second (central) of the three structural domains of the molecule."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1329165	The pattern of proteins synthesized in the liver is profoundly modified upon infection of susceptible mice with mouse hepatitis virus 3.	"Susceptible BALB/c mice, after experimental infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3), revealed virus titres in the liver that increased gradually to a peak of 8 x 10(5) PFU/g of tissue after 3 days' infection, when the mice died of acute hepatitis. BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with 35S-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity. We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs. The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins. Whether these proteins are a result of a defence attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1657211	Hepatitogenicity of three plaque purified mutants of hepatotropic mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-2.	"Hepatitogenicity of three plaque purified mutant strains of mouse hepatitis virus, designated as MHV-2S, -2M and -2L, isolated from MHV-2 infected SR-CDF1-DBT cells was studied. After intraperitoneal inoculation with 2 x 10(5) PFU of parental MHV-2 and its mutants to 4-week-old female ICR mice, 40% of mice inoculated with MHV-2S and 20% of mice with -2M died in one week, whereas with -2L all mice survived. All mice inoculated with MHV-2 died in 3 days postinoculation (p.i.). Virus titer of the liver of mice inoculated with MHV-2, -2S and -2M reached peaks (MHV-2:10(7) PFU/0.2 g, -2S: 10(5) PFU/0.2 g and -2M: 10(6) PFU/0.2 g) at 96 hr p.i., while with -2L a peak titer (10(3) PFU/0.2 g) was shown at 48 hr p.i. Immunofluorescence revealed MHV specific antigen in the liver of MHV-2S infected mice in and around necrotic areas though less extensive than that of parental MHV-2 infected mice. With MHV-2M specific fluorescence was restricted in degenerated hepatocytes in the small necrotic foci. In mice inoculated with MHV-2L only faint fluorescence was detected. Histopathologically, in the liver of MHV-2S infected mice zonal necrosis and cell infiltration were observed. There were spotty necrosis and focal cell infiltration in the liver of MHV-2M infected mice and only small inflammatory foci were seen in MHV-2L infected mice. Large number of extracellular virions were detectable in MHV-2S but not in -2M and -2L infected mice by electron microscopy."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1658436	In vitro splenic T cell responses of diverse mouse genotypes after oronasal exposure to mouse hepatitis virus, strain JHM.	"Mortality rates among BALB/cByJ, A/JCr, C3H/HeSnJ, and C57BL/6NCr mice inoculated oronasally with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM, ranged from 25 to 67%. Spleen cells harvested from the first three genotypes at 5 days postinoculation proliferated poorly in response to concanavalin A stimulation and produced significantly less interleukin (IL) 2 than cells from uninfected control mice. The function of spleen cells harvested at 14 days postinoculation varied and was host genotype-dependent. Despite clinical signs among some infected C57BL/6NCr mice, spleen cell function was relatively unaffected. C57BL/10ScNCr, B10.A, and SJL/JCr mice remained clinically normal after MHV inoculation. Proliferation and IL2 production by cells from inoculated C57BL/10ScNCr and B10.A mice were similar to responses of their respective controls. In contrast, cells from inoculated SJL/JCr mice were hyper-responsive and produced peak levels of IL2 earlier than control cells. Among the seven genotypes tested, only BALB/cByJ and C3H/HeSnJ spleen cells produced detectable IL4 after primary stimulation with concanavalin A or after priming and restimulation. Primary IL4 production by cells from these two genotypes was significantly reduced if donors were inoculated with MHV 5 days prior to spleen harvest. IL4 production by cells from acutely infected BALB/cByJ mice was considerably enhanced by priming and restimulation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1698910	Effect of olfactory bulb ablation on spread of a neurotropic coronavirus into the mouse brain.	"Previous results suggested that, after intranasal inoculation, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic coronavirus, entered the central nervous system (CNS) via the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization. Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion. MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain. Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	1705943	Protection of mice from a lethal coronavirus infection in the central nervous system by adoptive transfer of virus-specific T cell clones.	"The protective effect of a mouse hepatitis virus type-4 (MHV-4)-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell clone and a CD4+ helper T cell clone was examined by the adoptive transfer into brains of mice lethally infected with MHV-4. Mice survived acute encephalitis if more than 5 x 10(5) cells of either type of the virus-specific T cell clones had been transferred into H-2-matched recipients by 1 day post-infection. Although the adoptive transfer of both types of the T cell clones suppressed viral growth and viral antigen-positive cells in the brains, a significant inhibition of virus replication by the cytotoxic T cell clone was detected prior to that induced by the helper T cell clone. Histologically, cell destruction was prominent in the brains of mice which received the cytotoxic T cell clone. These results demonstrate that both the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell and the CD4+ helper T cell can protect mice from a lethal MHV-4 infection in the central nervous system."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2468325	Virus strain specificity of challenge immunity to coronavirus.	"The resistance of immunized mice to challenge with the same or a different strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) was examined as a model of challenge immunity to coronavirus infection. Genetically susceptible BALB/cByJ mice were given an intranasal immunizing infection of respiratory-type MHV-JHM, MHV-S, or enterotropic MHV-Y. Control mice were sham-immunized with sterile tissue culture fluid. Recovered mice were challenged intranasally with MHV-JHM, MHV-S or sterile tissue culture fluid at 30 days after immunization. Resistance to challenge inoculation was evaluated in groups of mice at 4 and 30 days after challenge. At 4 days, the prevalence of MHV lesions in nose and liver was tabulated and MHV titers in liver were determined. At 30 days, the prevalence of residual brainstem spongiform lesions was tabulated and serum antibody to MHV-JHM and MVH-S was quantified by enzyme immunoassay. Mice immunized with MHV-JHM or MHV-S resisted challenge with the MHV homotype, but MHV-S-immunized mice were fully susceptible to challenge with MVH-JHM. Mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were only partially protected against challenge with antigenically related, but biologically different MHV-S. Serum antibody responses to MHV supported these observations. These data indicate that challenge immunity to coronaviruses is strong, but highly virus strain-specific."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2535900	Monoclonal antibodies to the matrix (E1) glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus protect mice from encephalitis.	"Monoclonal antibodies to the matrix or E1 glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) were tested for their ability to protect mice from a normally lethal challenge of MHV-4. Four antibodies were tested, and two of these, J.1.3 and J.3.9, were protective. Protection did not correlate with virus neutralization in vitro, antibody isotype, recognition of a unique E1 antigenic site, or dependence on complement in vivo. Survival from acute encephalitis was followed by subacute demyelination, as has been shown with protection mediated by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against the major glycoprotein, E2. These results demonstrate that antibodies which are specific for a viral matrix protein are able to alter the course of disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2538027	Characterization of coronavirus JHM variants isolated from Wistar Furth rats with a viral-induced demyelinating disease.	"Murine hepatitis virus (MHV) can cause neurological disease when inoculated intracerebrally (ic) into mice and rats. Specifically the JHM strain of MHV (MHV-JHM) generally causes an acute encephalitis when inoculated ic into 2-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In contrast, JHM generally produces a chronic demyelinating disease with resulting posterior paralysis when inoculated ic into 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, while JHM readily produces a productive infection in a mouse fibroblast cell line (L-2), it does not form syncytia or replicate well in a tissue cell line of glial origin (G26-24). We have isolated and characterized three MHV-JHM viral variants from the central nervous system of two Wistar Furth rats with a MHV-JHM-induced demyelinating disease. The pattern of viral-specific mRNA for all three of these variants differed from what was observed for the wild-type parental MHV-JHM that had been passaged only in tissue culture. One of these variants, ATllf cord virus, which induced a chronic demyelinating disease in 2- or 10-day-old intracerebrally inoculated Wistar Furth rats, had a deletion in the coding region of the peplomer glycoprotein mRNA. In addition, this variant formed massive syncytia and replicated well in G26-24 cells. We have not detected this deletion in the other two JHM variants, ATllf brain virus and ATlle brain virus. ATllf brain virus and ATlle brain virus primarily produced an acute encephalitis when reinoculated into 2- or 10-day-old Wistar Furth rats. In addition, these two variants did not form syncytia and had a reduced ability to replicate in G26-24 cells."	0

"Progressive hepatitis in athymic nude (nu/nu) mice due to a low-virulent mouse hepatitis virus, MHV-2 cc, was examined for involvement of immunocytes and serum antibodies. At 3 to 6 weeks postinoculation (p.i.) a considerable number of Mac 1- and asialo GM1-positive cells were accumulated in the affected liver and spleen. There were also some Thy-1-positive cells. Later than 2 weeks p.i., serum IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in parallel with virus-neutralizing activity, while the IgG levels were lower than those of infected euthymic (nu/+) littermates. By transfer of the infected nu/nu mouse serum, the recipient euthymic mice acquired resistance to lethal challenge infection with a virulent virus, MHV-2."	0

"The hepatoprotection induced by synthetic muramyl peptides was investigated using a model of lethal murine mouse hepatitis MHV-3 virus infection. MDP and a nonpyrogenic analog, Murametide, inhibited the steep elevation of serum transaminases induced by MHV-3 irrespective of whether the immunomodulators were administered before or after the infection. A significant proportion of MDP or Murametide-treated animals, in contrast to controls, survived the MHV-3 infection. The histopathological examination of the liver revealed marked necrosis of the hepatic parenchymal cells and infiltration of the inflammatory cells in controls but not in MDP-treated animals."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2560461	A major role of macrophage activation by interferon-gamma during mouse hepatitis virus type 3 infection. I. Genetically dependent resistance.	"Resistance of mice to mouse hepatitis virus type 3 (MHV3) infection is genetically determined. Normal adult A/J mice are resistant, and BALB/c mice are susceptible. Higher titers of virus and interferon (IFN) in vivo were found in MHV3-infected BALB/c mice compared with A/J mice. In vitro activation of macrophages (M phi) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from A/J mice, although cell populations from both A/J and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-alpha/beta. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the delayed MHV3 replication in LPS-activated A/J M phi was due, in part, to IFN-alpha/beta. A/J M phi were found to be more sensitive to IFN-gamma than to IFN-alpha/beta, and BALB/c M phi did not develop an antiviral state to either IFN. Cultured spleen cells from A/J mice synthesized more IFN-gamma than BALB/c spleen cells after specific or non-specific stimulation. The results indicate that IFN-activated M phi may play a crucial role in the resistance to MHV3 infection. Since IFN-gamma is produced in large amounts by A/J spleen cells after specific stimulation with MHV3 and is efficient in activating the A/J M phi, a T cell-dependent mechanism is likely to be involved."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2825892	An immunological analysis of natural resistance to mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV strain) infection in C3H mice.	"1. Since the development of resistance against mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV strain) coincides with the maturation of the immune system, we studied the possible role of distinct immunological components in the resistance of adult mice during JHMV infection. 2. Adult C3H mice naturally resistant to JHMV were rendered susceptible to infection by lethal 60Co-irradiation and were subsequently reconstituted with limiting numbers of syngeneic bone marrow cells or spleen cells. 3. Resistance or susceptibility depended on the number of cells used for reconstitution and the interval between reconstitution and infection. Spleen cells from suckling mice affected neither resistance nor susceptibility and peritoneal cells from adult mice and thymus cells reduced resistance. Persistence of JHMV was demonstrated by virus reactivation. 4. Animals infected with JHMV only once before being rendered immunoincompetent showed a different pattern of resistance. One to four months after infection, 15 to 35% of the animals died after reconstitution without having been reinfected, and persisting JHMV was found in their liver, spleen and peritoneal exudate. The survivors (47 to 87%) were resistant to further JHMV infection during immunodeficiency. 5. Animals immunized 3 times with JHMV before irradiation did not show virus reactivation and were fully resistant to JHMV reinfection after reconstitution. The level of neutralizing anti-JHMV serum antibodies in the group of mice immunized only once was comparable with the level of those immunized 3 times. 6. The role of macrophage activation and cell-mediated immunity in this model are discussed as an explanation for the resistance to, and persistence of, JHMV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2834866	Detection of a murine coronavirus nonstructural protein encoded in a downstream open reading frame.	"Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) gene 5 contains two open reading frames. We have expressed the second open reading frame of this gene (gene 5 ORF 2) in an Escherichia coli expression system. This system utilized a plasmid which contained the promoter and the first 36 codons of the recA gene fused in frame with the MHV gene 5 ORF 2, which is fused in turn to the beta-galactosidase gene. The protein product of this gene fusion was used to raise antibody to gene 5 ORF 2. The specificity of the antibody was verified by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro transcribed and translated protein product of gene 5 ORF 2. The second reading frame of MHV gene 5 was shown to be expressed during the course of infection by immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoprecipitation using the antibody raised against the E. coli fusion protein and by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2844793	Membrane integration and intracellular transport of the coronavirus glycoprotein E1, a class III membrane glycoprotein.	"The E1-glycoprotein (Mr = 26,014; 228 amino acids) of mouse hepatitis virus A59 is a class III membrane glycoprotein which has been used in this study as a model system in the study of membrane integration and protein transport. The protein lacks an NH2-terminal cleavable signal sequence and spans the viral membrane three times. Hydrophobic domains I and III could serve as signal sequences for cotranslational membrane integration. Domain I alone was sufficient to translocate the hydrophilic NH2 terminus of E1 across the membranes as evidenced by glycosylation of a newly introduced N-glycosylation site. The COOH-terminal part of E1 involving amino acids Leu124 to Thr228 was found to associate tightly with membranes at the post-translational level, although this part of the molecule lacks pronounced hydrophobic sequences. Membrane protection assays with proteinase K showed that a 2-kDa hydrophilic fragment was removed from the COOH terminus of E1 indicating that the protein is largely embedded into the membrane. Microinjection of in vitro transcribed capped and polyadenylated mRNA into CV-1 cells or into secretory AtT20 pituitary tumor cells showed that the E1-protein accumulated in the Golgi but was not detectable at the plasma membrane or in secretory granules. The 28 NH2-terminal hydrophilic amino acid residues play no role in membrane assembly or in intracellular targeting. Various NH2-terminal portions of E1 were fused to Ile145 of the cytoplasmic N-protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The resulting hybrid proteins were shown to assemble into membranes in vitro and were detected either in the rough endoplasmic reticulum or transient vesicles of microinjected cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2982018	Pathogenicity of mouse hepatitis virus for preimplantation mouse embryos.	"Mouse embryos which were hatched from the zona pellucida in vitro in the presence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) or outgrown on coverslips and then exposed to MHV were shown by immunohistochemical staining to have virally infected trophoblast cells. Zona-intact embryos incubated with MHV for 48 h (2-cell embryos) or 1.5 h (blastocysts) were resistant to infection. Morulae and early blastocysts collected from donor mice experimentally infected with MHV were not infected, but the medium in which they were flushed from the uterine horns was contaminated with virus. No virus was detected after embryos were washed through three changes of uncontaminated medium. MHV was transmitted to foster mothers when embryos were transferred in medium contaminated with the virus. Fetal and decidual tissues were not infected. We suggest that embryo transfer is an effective and simple alternative to Caesarian rederivation of MHV-contaminated mice."	0

"Geotropic direction-changing nystagmus in lateral body positions was observed in 4-week-old BALB/c mice after intracerebral injection with a temperature-sensitive mutant of mouse hepatitis virus. The positional nystagmus was detected already 2 days after infection and it lasted half a year at least. The nystagmic responses of the semicircular canals were also evaluated before and after infection. They were unaltered during the disease, which was clinically manifested by general weakness, ataxia and tremor. Histopathological examination 2 weeks after infection revealed demyelination in various parts of the CNS."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	2999444	Proteolytic cleavage of the E2 glycoprotein of murine coronavirus: host-dependent differences in proteolytic cleavage and cell fusion.	"Cell fusion induced by infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) varied markedly in extent and time course in four different murine cell lines. When inoculated at a multiplicity of 3 to 5 PFU per cell, the Sac-, L2, and DBT cell lines began to fuse by 7 h, were fused into confluent syncytia by 9 to 12 h, and peeled from the substrate by 10 to 14 h. These virulent virus-cell interactions were in striking contrast to the moderate interaction of MHV-A59 with the 17 Cl 1 cell line, in which only small syncytia were observed 18 h postinoculation, and greater than 50% of the cells remained unfused by 24 h. The yield of infectious virus produced by 17 Cl 1 cells was 10-fold higher than the yields from the other three cell lines. The processing of the nucleocapsid protein, the membrane glycoprotein E1, and the peplomeric glycoprotein E2 were found to differ significantly in the four cell lines. Since the E2 glycoprotein is responsible for virus-induced cell fusion, we attempted to correlate differences in cellular processing of E2 with differences in fusion of infected cells. The predominant intracellular form of E2 in all cell lines was the 180K species. Pulse-chase experiments showed that a small portion of the 17 Cl 1 cell-associated 180K E2 was cleaved by 1 h after synthesis to yield 90K E2, shown in the preceding paper to consist of two different glycoproteins called 90A and 90B (L. S. Sturman, C. S. Ricard, and K. V. Holmes, J. Virol. 56:904-911, 1985). This cleavage occurred shortly before the release of virions from cells, as shown by pulse-chase experiments. After budding at intracellular membranes, virions released into the medium by the four cell lines contained different ratios of 180K to 90K E2. Virions from Sac- cells, which contained 100% 90K E2, fused L2 cells rapidly without requiring virus replication, whereas virions from 17 Cl 1 cells, which had 50% 90K E2, required trypsin activation to induce rapid fusion (Sturman et al., J. Virol. 56:904-911, 1985). The addition of protease inhibitors to the medium markedly delayed L2 cell fusion induced by MHV infection. The extent of coronavirus-induced cell fusion does not depend solely upon the percent cleavage of the E2 glycoprotein by cellular proteases, since extensive fusion was induced by infection of L2 and DBT cells but not 17 Cl 1 cells, although all three cell lines cleaved E2 to the same extent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	3002736	Effect of exogenous mouse interferon on murine fulminant hepatitis induced by mouse hepatitis virus type 2.	"We investigated the effect of exogenous mouse alpha- + beta-interferon produced by mouse L cells on the growth of mouse hepatitis virus type 2 (MHV-2) in the liver, the development of liver cell necrosis, and survival in murine fulminant hepatitis induced by MHV-2. Murine fulminant hepatitis was induced in 4-week-old male ICR mice by intraperitoneal inoculation of MHV-2. Mouse interferon (10(3) IU/mouse/day) was intraperitoneally injected every day. Exogenous mouse interferon suppressed both the growth of MHV-2 in the liver tissue and development of liver cell necrosis, and prolonged the survival. It was also found that the earlier mouse interferon was administered, the greater was the prolongation of survival."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	3018279	Translation and processing of mouse hepatitis virus virion RNA in a cell-free system.	"The first event after infection with mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 (MHV-A59) is presumed to be the synthesis of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the input genomic RNA. The synthesis and processing of this putative polymerase protein was studied in a cell-free translation system utilizing 60S RNA from MHV-A59 virions. The polypeptide products of this reaction included two major species of 220 and 28 kilodaltons. Kinetics experiments indicated that both p220 and p28 appeared after 60 min of incubation and that protein p28 was synthesized initially as the N-terminal portion of a larger precursor protein. When the cell-free translation products were labeled with N-formyl[35S]methionyl-tRNAi, p28 was the predominant radioactive product, confirming its N-terminal location within a precursor protein. Translation in the presence of the protease inhibitors leupeptin and ZnCl2 resulted in the disappearance of p28 and p220 and the appearance of a new protein, p250. This product, which approached the maximal size predicted for a protein synthesized from genomic RNA, was not routinely detected in the absence of inhibitors even under conditions which optimized the translation reaction for elongation of proteins. Subsequent chelation of ZnCl2 resulted in the partial cleavage of the precursor protein and the reappearance of p28. One-dimensional peptide mapping with Staphylococcus aureus V-8 protease confirmed the precursor-product relationship of p250 and p28. The results show that MHV virion RNA, like many other viral RNAs, is translated into a large polyprotein, which is cleaved soon after synthesis into smaller, presumably functional proteins. This is in marked contrast to the synthesis of other MHV proteins, in which minimal proteolytic processing occurs."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	3027167	Accumulation and chemotaxis of natural killer/large granular lymphocytes at sites of virus replication.	"A model for monitoring the accumulation of natural killer cell/large granular lymphocytes (NK/LGL) at a site of virus replication was studied by using mice infected i.p. with either lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), Pichinde virus, or vaccinia virus. An i.p. but not i.v. infection resulted in a localized increase in NK/LGL cell number (a fourfold to greater than 20-fold increase) and augmentation (a 10- to 20-fold increase) of NK cell activity associated with virus-induced peritoneal exudate cell (PEC) populations. An increase in NK/LGL cell number was detected as early as 12 hr postinfection (p.i.) and peaked at 3 days p.i. with MHV. The initial LGL recruited into the peritoneal cavity at 1 to 3 days p.i. were nonadherent to plastic and were demonstrated to have an NK cell phenotype: asialo GM1+, Thy-1.2 +/-, Lyt-2.2-, and J11d-. The peak number of LGL appeared at 7 days after infection with the NK cell-resistant virus, LCMV. This LGL population had been previously demonstrated to contain cytotoxic T lymphocyte/LGL (CTL/LGL) as well as NK/LGL. During an MHV infection the number of LGL decreased between days 3 and 7 p.i., suggesting that the second wave of CTL/LGL was absent. These findings may explain the absence of a good MHV-CTL model. Virus-induced, activated NK/LGL responded to chemotactic signals by migrating in a unidirectional manner across two 5-microns pore size polycarbonate filters during 7 hr in vitro chemotaxis assays. Wash-out fluid obtained from the peritoneal cavity contained chemotactic activity for NK/LGL as well as for other cell types. We conclude that production and/or release of chemotactic factors at sites of virus replication are at least partially responsible for the accumulation of NK/LGL at these sites."	0

"Genetically resistant G3H mice routinely yielded macrophages that were resistant when grown in 90% horse serum. These mice also routinely yielded macrophages that were susceptible to the same virus, MHV (PRI), in vitro after the mice had been treated with three intraperitoneal doses, of hydrocortisone. Dexamethasone and prednisolone when similarly administered also increased the susceptibility of C3H macrophages taken from the treated animal, but progesterone and testosterone did not. In addition, spleen cells from mice treated with cortisone made the resistant C3H macrophages 100 times more susceptible in vitro. Increased in vitro susceptibility induced in this way by hydrocortisone was reversed by exposure to supernatant fluid removed from cultures of concanavalin A-treated spleen cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	6275022	Early interaction between mouse hepatitis virus 3 and cells.	"The interaction between mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3) and cells was studied in order to investigate whether or not early events occurring after infection could be involved in the difference in virus replication seen between mouse strains with different genetic sensitivities to MHV3 infection. Kinetic data showed that MHV3 uptake by both macrophages and L cells was time- and temperature-dependent. In addition, treatment of cells with cytochalasin B or prostaglandin E1, prior to virus infection, resulted in a strong inhibition of sheep red blood cell phagocytosis without any effect on MHV3 uptake. Similar uptake of radiolabelled MHV3 was shown by whole spleen cells, purified T lymphocytes and thymocytes. Furthermore, no difference in 3H-labelled MHV3 uptake was seen between macrophages originating from resistant A/J mice, semi-susceptible (C57Bl/6 x A/J)F1 and susceptible animals. These results indicate, therefore, that genetically related in vivo sensitivity toward MHV3 infection is not related to differential uptake of virus by cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	6275875	The pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis in the nude mouse and its influence on liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy.	"The pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis due to infection with mouse hepatitis virus Type 1 has been followed over a period of 30 days in the nu/nu mouse. The initial histopathology is that of a focal hepatic necrosis which evolves into a chronic hepatitis with cirrhosis. The histopathology of the experimentally induced hepatitis with mouse hepatitis Type 1 is indistinguishable from that produced by the disease in nude mouse colonies due to the natural infection in the United Kingdom and also indistinguishable from the histopathology produced by the nude mouse hepatitis virus isolated in Japan. The virus produces a temporary suppression and delay in liver regeneration of nude mice which have been partially hepatectomized and this is compared to the delay in liver regeneration induced by another more virulent strain of mouse hepatitis, Type A59, in the nude mouse."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	20369302	Pathogenesis of murine coronavirus in the central nervous system.	"Murine coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV) is a collection of strains that induce disease in several organ systems of mice. Infection with neurotropic strains JHM and A59 causes acute encephalitis, and in survivors, chronic demyelination, the latter of which serves as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. The MHV receptor is a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule, CEACAM1a; paradoxically, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), leading to speculation of an additional receptor. Comparison of highly neurovirulent JHM isolates with less virulent variants and the weakly neurovirulent A59 strain, combined with the use of reverse genetics, has allowed mapping of pathogenic properties to individual viral genes. The spike protein, responsible for viral entry, is a major determinant of tropism and virulence. Other viral proteins, both structural and nonstructural, also contribute to pathogenesis in the CNS. Studies of host responses to MHV indicate that both innate and adaptive responses are crucial to antiviral defense. Type I interferon is essential to prevent very early mortality after infection. CD8 T cells, with the help of CD4 T cells, are crucial for viral clearance during acute disease and persist in the CNS during chronic disease. B cells are necessary to prevent reactivation of virus in the CNS following clearance of acute infection. Despite advances in understanding of coronavirus pathogenesis, questions remain regarding the mechanisms of viral entry and spread in cell types expressing low levels of receptor, as well as the unique interplay between virus and the host immune system during acute and chronic disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	21073281	Murine coronavirus neuropathogenesis: determinants of virulence.	"Murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), causes various diseases depending on the strain and route of inoculation. Both the JHM and A59 strains, when inoculated intracranially or intranasally, are neurovirulent. Comparison of the highly virulent JHM isolate, JHM.SD, with less virulent JHM isolates and with A59 has been used to determine the mechanisms and genes responsible for high neuropathogenicity of MHV. The focus of this review is on the contributions of viral spread, replication, and innate and adaptive immunity to MHV neuropathogenesis. JHM.SD spreads more quickly among neurons than less neurovirulent MHVs, and is able to spread in the absence of the canonical MHV receptor, CEACAM1a. The observation that JHM.SD infects more cells and expresses more antigen, but produces less infectious virus per cell than A59, implies that efficient replication is not always a correlate of high neurovirulence. This is likely due to the unstable nature of the JHM.SD spike protein (S). JHM.SD induces a generally protective innate immune response; however, the strong neutrophil response may be more pathogenic than protective. In addition, JHM.SD induces only a minimal T-cell response, whereas the strong T-cell response and the concomitant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) induced by the less neurovirulent A59 is protective. Differences in the S and nucleocapsid (N) proteins between A59 and JHM.SD contribute to JHM.SD neuropathogenicity. The hemmagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein may enhance neuropathogenicity of some MHV isolates, but is unlikely a major contributor to the high neuroviruence of JHM.SD. Further data suggest that neither the internal (I) protein nor nonstructural proteins ns4, and ns2 are significant contributors to neurovirulence."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	16072	Expression of endogenous murine leukemia viruses during the course of a protracted immunological disorder.	"Mice of the low leukemia (BALB/cJ x A/J)F1 hybrid (CAF1) strain express B-and N-tropic infectious murine leukemia virus (MuLV) after the age of 6 mo. Initation of a protracted immunological disorder, the graft-versus-host reaction (GVHR), at 7 wk of age, accelerates the induction of both these mouse-tropic endogenous viruses, and preferentially enhances the replication of B-tropic MuLV. The earlier appearance of B-tropic MuLV in a greater proportion of mice and in higher titer is thought to be casually related to the eventual development of lymphoreticular tumors in the GVHR mice, since previous studies have shown that these same tumors can be reproduced by inoculating syngeneic recipients with serially passaged GVHR extracts containing B-tropic MuLV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	48258	Selective immunosuppressive activity of steroids in mice inoculated with the Moloney Sarcoma virus (38503).	"A steroid, 6-chloro-17-hydroxypregna-1,4,6-triene-3,20-doine (CHP) that exhibits selective activity in several models of cellular immunity including an apparent inhibitory action on the elicitation of delayed hypersensitivity, was examined in a new, simple experimental model for assessing aspects of host-cell-mediated immunological competence. This model is based upon the capacity of the adult mouse to prevent the progressive growth of tumors induced by the Moloney sarcoma virus. Two steroids reported to have immunosuppressive activity in other assay systems, namely, cortisol and progesterone, were also studied. Control mice and those injected with CHP maintained their capacity to reject the tumor. In contrast, significant numbers of mice receiving a single large injection of cortisol or progesterone succumbed to progressive tumor growth under the experimental conditions used. The data indicate that CHP, while influencing selected parameters of cellular immunity, e.g., the elicitation of delayed hypersensitivity, does not decrease the capacity of the host to mount a defense against the progressive growth of the Moloney virus-induced sarcoma. The results indicate that CHP may be useful in modulating specific aspects of cellular immunity without altering others. In addition, the experimental model described provides a simple method of assessing the possible immunosuppressive effects of naturally occurring and synthetic agents on viral-induced tumor growth."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	51621	Characterization of murine sarcoma virus transformation of guinea pig cells and activation of an RNA tumor-like virus from nonproducer guinea pig cells.	"Guinea pig embryo (GEP) cells were transformed in vitro by the Kirsten strain of mouse sarcoma virus (Ki-MSV). The transformed cells were found to release infectious virus continuously and produced high titers of group-specific (gs) complement-fixing (CF) antigen characteristics of the murine sarcoma-leukemia virus complex. Foci of transformed cells were similar in appearance to those obtained with Ki-MSV in mouse and rat cells. The transformed cells produced RNA dependent DNA polymerase and type C virus particles with a density of approximately 1.15 g/ml in sucrose gradients by 3H-uridine labeling. The transformed cells produced tumors when transplanted into newborn guinea pigs. A number of focus-derived clonal lines from Ki-MSV transformed cells were isolated and characterized. All the focus-derived lines were found to be either producers or nonproducers (NP). The NP guinea pig cells produced neither infectious virus nor viral antigens of the murine sarcoma-leukemia virus complex although they were morphologically indistinguishable from virus-releasing MSV transformed GPE lines and produced tumors when transplanted into newborn guinea pigs. However, the sarcoma virus genome could be rescued in these NP cells by cocultivation with \"helper\" murine leukemia virus (MuLV) releasing GPE cells. Particles resembling guinea pig leukemia virus were activated from guinea pig NP cells or cultured normal guinea pig cells following chemical treatment. These particles were approximately 100 nm in the mature form and had a density of 1.16-1.17 g/ml. They contained RNA dependent DNA polymerase activity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	54438	In vitro inhibition of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against syngeneic Friend virus-induced leukemia by immunoregulatory alpha globulin.	"Immunoregulatory alpha-globulin (IRA) derived from normal human plasma decreased cytotoxic reactivity as measured by an in vitro 5-iodo-2'-deoxyridine release assay of immune mouse lymphocytes against the syngeneic Friend virus-induced leukemia, FBL-3. This inhibitory effect depended on the dose of IRA used and was not due to the cytotoxic effects of IRA on the effector cells or target tumor cells. We also found elevated levels of serum alpha-gloubins in FBL-3 tumor-bearing mice as compared to normal mice. These data and the demonstration of decreased specific cytotoxic reactivity in FBL-3 tumor-bearing mice suggest that IRA functions in the suppression of the host's immune response against tumors."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	82624	Acquisition of oncogenicity by endogenous mouse type C viruses: effects of variations in env and gag  genes.	"Several dual-tropic isolates derived from the thymuses of preleukemic or leukemic AKR mice and a more recrnt group of viruses generated by in vitro or in vivo passage of a poorly infectious endogenous virus of C3H mouse cells have been shown to be highly oncogenic. By analysis of the immunological properties of their gag gene-coded structural proteins, each of the AKR-derived isolates and two dual-tropic C3H-derived isolates were found to closely resemble AKR murine leukemia virus. In contrast, gag gene-coded proteins of two other leukemogenic isolates of C3H origin, including one ecotropic and one dual-tropic virus, were indistinguishable from those of Moloney murine leukemia virus. All of the oncogenic isolates, including those of AKR and C3H origin, were found to possess common envelope glycoprotein determinants of a unique class not shared by the nononcogenic ecotropic viruses from which they were derived. These findings support the possibility that oncogenic variants of endogenous ecotropic mouse type C viruses are derived by genetic recombination. This recombinational event appears to involve the acquisition, by different ecotropic viruses, of a common class of endogenous virus-coded envelope glycoprotein determinants which are presumably required, but not necessarily sufficient, for oncogenicity."	0

"The reactivity of tumor-specific transplantation antigens (TSTAs) induced by SV40 and BK virus (BKV) was studied in Balb/Ccr mice with SV40-transformed tumor cells (mKSA-4AC). The mice, which had received BKV-transformed mouse or hamster cells, were highly resistant to the challenge with mKSA-4AC. The mKSA-rejected animals, however, were as susceptible as non-immunized ones to the subsequent challenge with Moloney sarcoma virus (Kirsten)-transformed cells. The result shows that BKV-transformed cells have a TSTA immunologically related closely to that induced by SV40."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	109575	The generation and specificity of cytotoxic T cells raised against syngeneic tumor cells bearing AKR/Gross murine leukemia virus antigens.	"Efforts were made to generate C57BL/6 cytotoxic effector cells to a syngeneic leukemia (E{male}G2) bearing AKR/Gross virus antigens. As we were unable to induce significant cytotoxic activity by immunization with up to 10(8) irradiated E{male}G2 cells, even when cells from such primed animals were subsequently restimulated with E{male}G2 cells in vitro, C57BL/6 mice were immunized with an aliogeneic, virus-producing AKR leukemic cell line (AKR SL3). Peritoneal exudate cells and, to a lesser degree, spleen cells from these mice showed significant lytic activity toward the immunizing allogeneic tumor but not toward E{male}G2. When spleen cells were harvested from animals {approximately equal to}10 d after injection of AKR SL3 and rechallenged in vitro with either E{male}G2 or AKR.H-2(b) SL1, another tumor that displays AKR/Gross virus antigens, then a vigorous cytotoxic response against E{male}G2 and AKR. H-2(b) SL1 was obtained. Effector cells generated by AKR SL3 priming followed by in vitro stimulation with E{male}G2 or AKR.H-2(b) SL1 lysed only cells of H-2(b) haplotype which were strongly positive for the display of serologically detectable AKR/Gross virus antigens. Thus, AKR SL3 cells were not lysed nor were EL4 cells (H-2(b); but only weakly positive for gp70). Cells not bearing the MuLV antigens tested for, such as P815 mastocytoma cells and spleen cell \"blasts\" from C57BL/6 and CBA (H-2(k)) mice, were also insusceptible to attack. The cytotoxic effector cells induced bore Thy 1.2 alloantigen and were of the Lyt 1+2+ phenotype. Collectively, these findings are consistent with the conclusion that the cytotoxic T cells raised against E{male}G2 are directed against AKR/Gross virus-associated antigens and are H-2 restricted. It will be of interest to determine the relevance of such effector cells to the known resistance of the C57BL/6 mouse to AKR/Gross virus-induced leukemia."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	128993	Large round cell granulomas induced by murine sarcoma virus (Moloney) in mouse brains.	"The effect of murine sarcoma virus of Moloney strain on central nervous system was examined morphologically in Swiss mice of different age. A single intracranial inoculation of cell-free virus solution resulted in the induction of characteristic intracerebral granulomas in 82.8% of the newborn to 5 day-old group, in 71.4% of the 6 to 10 day-old group, and in 68.0% of the 11 to 20 day-old group. The mean latency periods to tumor recognition were 16.5, 21.1, and 33.5 days, respectively. The granuloma consisted of inflammatory cell infilrations, reactive gliosis, and richly developed blood vessels. The lesions consistently contained numerous characteristic large round cells. In cases of long-survival, the findings included reparative changes, such as extensive gliosis, withdrawal of inflammation, and a decrease in the numbers of large round cells and blood vessels. These lesions were tentatively designated as \"large round cell granuloma.\" The early foci of the granoloma were composed of proliferating glial cells and large round cells at the subependymal regions. Electron microscopically these large round cells had abundant intracytoplasmic fibrils quite similar to gliofibrils. Numerous C-type virus particles were present in the intercellular nad perivascular spaces, and occasionally budded from cell membranes of the large round cells and vascular endothelia. The large round cells were considered to be reactive astrocytes activated by biral infection. It was conclided that MSV-M was not a sarcomogenic but a granulomogenic virus in mice. Control animals showed no pathological changes."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	156765	Suppressor T cells regulate the cytolytic T lymphocyte response to syngeneic tumors induced by murine sarcoma virus (MSV) in the mouse.	"Studies were designed to analyze the immune activities of spleen cells from mice previously injected with murine sarcoma virus (MSV) and undergoing the processes of MSV tumor growth and rejection. Fractionation of MSV-primed spleen cells according to cell size by velocity sedimentation at unit gravity showed that MSV-specific cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL) generated in vivo underwent an apparent transition in size from large to small cells as the tumor regressed. The majority of CTL precursors, however, were invariably recovered among small to medium-sized MSV-immune cells, as revealed to CTL generation in vitro in secondary mixed leukocyte-tumor cell cultures (MLTC). Evidence was obtained for the existence in MSV-immune spleens of two suppressor cell populations capable of inhibiting CTL generation in vitro: one population probably consisted of macrophages and could be removed by treatment with carbonyl iron; the second population was comprised of T cells and inhibited the differentiation of tumor-immune CTL precursors in a selective manner. These results provide a preliminary overview of the mechanisms regulating the generation, differentiation, and activity of tumor-specific CTL in a syngeneic model system."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	163327	Isolation of a B-tropic type-C virus from reticulum cell neoplasms induced in BALB/c mice by SJL/J type-C virus.	"D1-murine leukemia virus (MuLV), an N-tropic type-C virus isolated from a spontaneous reticulum cell neoplasm, type B (RCN-B) of an SJL/J mouse was propagated in NIH Swiss mouse embryo cell cultures. When injected into BALB/c mice 1 day after neonatal thymectomy, 30% of the inoculated mice developed RCN-B in 5 months, whereas none of the uninoculated controls did. From the spleen and lymph node extracts of all RCN-B-bearing mice tested, B-tropic type-C viruses (designated E1-MuLV) were isolated in high titers (10-5 minus 10-6 XC plaque-forming units/ml). Only low titers (10-1 minus 10-2 XC plaque-forming units/ml) of N- or B-tropic viruses were isolated from those thymectomized mice, inoculated but nontumorous, whereas only N-tropic viruses were detected in the uninoculated thymectomized mice. No virus was isolated from the nonthymectomized, untreated controls. Antigenically, the viral envelope antigen (VEA) of E1-MuLV was distinct from those of DU-MuLV, xVEA, or Gross-VEA, but some cross reaction with AKR-MuLV-VEA was observed. The relationship of D1-MuLV to E1-MuVL with respect to oncogenesis and viral genome activation was discussed."	0

"In vitro L1210 (V) cell lines contained abundant intracytoplasmic A-particles, numerous C-type particles, a small number of B-type particles, and occasional intracisternal A-particles. The intracytoplasmic A-particles were incorporated into both spiked (B-type) and smooth-surfaced (C-type) particles formed at the budding site. Both B-and C-type particles also developed by gradual accululation of neucleooid material. The particles, particularly the C-type, exhibited a wide range of densities. The cells showed strong surface immunofluoresence for both murine mammary tumor virus and Gross murine leukemia virus antigens and variable degrees of cytoplasmic immunoflurescence for the protein antigens (p1 to p6) of Rauscher leukemia virus. The cells, the culture supernatant, and the purified virus each gave positive reactions with murine mammary tumor virus and murine leukemia virus antisera by immunodiffusion. The viral particles failed to infect C57BL, C57BL/6 X DBA/2F1 (hereafter called BD2F1), BALB/c, Af,and RIIIf mice.

mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	167960	Sarcoma-negative leukemia-positive transformed cell culture established from a murine sarcoma virus-induced rat bone tumor.	"Inoculation of the Soehner-Dmochowski isolate of the Moloney strain of murine sarcoma virus (MSV), designated MSV-SD, consistently leads to the development of bone tumors in the susceptible New Zealand black (NB) rats. Two separate cell cultures have been established from 2 individual MSV-SD-induced NB rat bone tumors. Cells of 1 bone tumor culture, designated RBT-E, are in early in vitro passages. These cells form colonies in agar medium and take up 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose at a greatly enhanced rate, 5 times that of normal nontransformed rat embryo cells. Cells of the RBT-E culture release both MSV and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and therefore contain sarcoma-positive leukemia-positive transformed cells. The other rat bone tumor culture, designated RBT-L, produced MSV at early passages. RBT-L culture has been passaged over 130 times in vitro. Cells of the RBT-L culture form colonies in agar medium and take up 2-deoxy-D-[3H]glucose at an enhanced rate (3 times that of rat embryo cells), indicating the presence of transformed cells within the RBT-L culture. However, cells of the RBT-L culture at late passages (Passage 130 or more) produce only MuLV and no detectable MSV activity (as shown by the lack of tumor-inducing activity and the lack of focus-forming activities by direct assay or by infectious center assay). Attempts to rescue MSV activity from RBT-L cells by cocultivation with MuLV-producing mouse cells were not successful. The MuLV found in the RBT-L cells, however, is a competent helper virus capable of rescuing the MSV genome from MSV-SD-induced hamster bone tumor cells. All the available evidence supports the notion that late passages of the RBT-L culture contain transformed cells that do not produce conventionally detectable MSV. These cells are referred to as sarcoma-negative leukemia-positive cells. The sarcoma-negative leukemia-positive cells represent a different kind of MSV-induced transformed cells and provide a unique system for studies in search of MSV markers such as MSV-specific antigens and MSV-specific nucleotide sequences."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	168259	Secondary cell-mediated cytotoxic response to syngeneic mouse tumor challenge.	"When C57BL/6 mice previously immunized with murine sarcoma virus (MSV) were challenged with a Rauscher virus-induced lymphoma, RBL-5, a secondary cell-mediated cytotoxic response could be detected by the Cr release cytotoxicity assay. The level and distribution of the secondary cytotoxic response was affected by the route of challenge. Animals injected i.p. demonstrated a high level of cytotoxicity in the peritoneal exudate cells 3 days after challenge and subsequently cytotoxicity was detected in most lymphoid organs, although at lower levels. However, when the animals were challenged intramuscularly in the leg, the response was not detected as rapidly and furthermore cytotoxic lymphocytes were found only in the draining lymph node and not in other lymphoid organs. Treatment of the effector cells with anti-theta and complement showed the secondary response to be predominately dependent on T cells. In addition, the cytotoxicity was specific in that cells lacking cross-reacting antigens were not killed by these attacker cells from mice undergoing a secondary response."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	170220	Genetic control of oncogenesis by murine sarcoma virus Moloney pseudotype. II. A dominant epistatic susceptibility gene.	"We have shown in the preceding paper that AKR mice are highly resistant to M-MSV tumor development, and that resistance is transmitted as a dominant character. In the present studies the tumor-response pattern of F1 hybrids between resistant AKR and susceptible strains (C57Bl/6, BALB/c and B10BR) following injection with Moloney mouse sarcoma virus (M-MSV) resembles that of the non-AKR parent. Segregation is observed in first backcross (Bc1) and F2 mice, and the segregation ratios up to Bc3 mice fit a one-gene model. The data of triple cross hybrids suggests that this dominant susceptibility gene inhibits the phenotypic expression of M-MSV tumor resistance in some susceptible Fv1bb strains as well as in their hybrids with AKR. Neither Fv-1 nor H-2 exerts any significant influence on this complex system."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	173888	Studies on morphological transformation of BALB/3T3-derived clones by murine leukemia virus.	"We have described a cell line, UC1-B, derived spontaneously from BALB/3T3 mouse embryo cells, which, unlike the standard BALB/3T3, are morphologically transformed and produce bizarre viral forms in response to murine leukemia virus. Although UC1-B and BALB/3T3 are morphologically similar, and both form contact-inhibited monolayers at confluence, the UC1-B cells are partially transformed because: they grow to a slightly higher saturation density than 3T3 cells, they grow in medium lacking serum growth factors, and they produce tumors in mice. Another clone, 12A-3, derived from BALB/3T3, also transforms and produces bizarre viral forms after infection with murine leukemia virus. Unlike UC1-B cells, the 12A3-8 cells are identical in growth properties to BALB/3T3; therefore, a partially altered morphology is not required for the induction of transformation by murine leukemia virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	177196	Virion interaction in mouse lymphomas.	"Virion expression in filtrates of lymphomas in AKR/J or C3H/HeJ mice was assayed by two techniques: (a) in vitro infectivity (XC assay), or (b) acceleration of oncogenicity in vivo (O assay). The two assays appeared to detect different virus populations or activities. This was shown when the same filtrates were tested in parallel by the XC and O tests and opposite results were obtained on the two assays, e.g., XC+ 0- or XC- O+. It was postulated that two viruses, termed \"XC+\" and \"O\" to correspond to the assays used to detect them, were involved in oncogenesis. When lymphomas originally virus induced were passaged by cells in 2- to 3-month-old syngeneic AKR or C3H mice, oncogenic activity of filtrates of these transplanted lymphomas decreased as cell passages increased. These filtrates from C3H lymphomas also had decreased XC activity as cell passages increased. Normal lymphoid tissue from 1- to 5-month-old AKR mice was XC+ O-, while from C3H mice it was XC- O-. Thus, the two strains modified activities lacking in their normal tissues. Filtrates highly oncogenic in XC+ newborn AKR mice were oncogenic in C3H newborn mice only when sufficient XC+ virus was in the inoculum received by the XC- C3H mice. Thus the XC+ virus appeared to play a synergistic role with a postulated O virus in oncogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	180209	Persistence of the viral genome in interferon-treated cells infected with oncogneic or nononcogenic viruses.	"In AKR mouse cells chronically infected with a murine leukemia virus, treatment with interferon for nine days resulted in sustained inhibition of extracellular production of murine leukemia virus but no inhibition of viral intracellular p30 antigen or of reverse transcriptase. Removal of interferon resulted in rapid reversal of these effects. Interferon-treated mouse L-cells were infected with high multiplicities of vesicular stomatitis virus or herpes simplex virus type 1. Infectious virus and intracellular viral antigen were rapidly eliminated from the interferon-treated cultures infected with herpes simplex virus. In cultures infected with vesicular stomatitis virus, titers of virus remained low in interferon-treated cells, but after about two weeks they rose rapidly and the cultures were destroyed. If treatment with interferon was reinstituted as late as nine days after primary infection, infectious vesicular stomatitis virus was eliminated, and there was no evidence for survival of the viral genome in these cultures. In the cultures infected with murine leukemia virus, inhibition of production of virus by treatment with interferon was possible, but the viral genome was not eliminated. In cells acutely infected with vesicular stomatitis virus or herpes simplex virus, however, the viral genomes were apparently eliminated from cultures treated with interferon."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	181139	Accumulation of cystine auxotrophic thymocytes accompanying type C viral leukemogenesis in the mouse.	"Certain continuous lymphoid and myeloid tumor cell lines of rodent origin are unable to grow in tissue culture in the absence of pre-formed L-cystine (CYS). In contrast, three NZB murine lymphoid cell lines obtained from NZB mice free of hematopoietic neoplasm can grow as well in cystine-deficient media containing L-cystathionine (CSN), the immediate precursor of CYS in the biosynthetic pathway, as in cystine sufficient medium. The former class of cells is, therefore, CYS auxotrophs (CYS-) and the latter CYS prototrophs (CYS+). Compared to CYS+ cells, the CYS- lines appear to be relatively deficient in the enzyme cystathionase, which catalyzes the cleavage of CSN to CYS and alpha-ketobutyrate. Using protein synthetic capacity as a criterion, normal thymocytes from mixed-bred Swiss mice behave like CYS prototrophs, while those from littermates bearing Moloney type C virus-induced thymic tumors behave like CYS auxotrophs. The former are also characterized by substantially higher levels of cystathionase than the latter. Extracts of thymocytes from tumor-free AKR mouse thymus are also characterized by higher levels of cystathionase activity than extracts of spontaneous AKR thymomas. Exogenous in vitro type C virus infection of a CYS+ cell results in vigorous virus production but no concomitant reduction in cystathionase activity. Thus viral replication alone in any random lymphoid cell is not sufficient to alter the enzyme level. The data therefore suggests that CYS auxotrophy may closely accompany neoplastic transformation of certain hematopoietic cells in vivo, including that induced by certain \"thymic\" type C viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	186786	Quantitative studies of integration of murine leukemia virus after exogenous infection.	"Using a [3H]DNA probe prepared from AKR murine leukemia virus, we determined the number of copies of the AKR virus genome integrated into the cellular DNA after exogenous infection of NIH mouse, AKR mouse, and rat cells in tissue culture. NIH mouse cells, which lack a portion of the viral genome (referred to as Gross-AKR specific sequences), incorporated three to four copies of these sequences per haploid genome. AKR cells, in which the Gross-AKR specific sequences are already present as three to four copies per haploid genome, did not shwo any distinct change in copy number after infection. Rat cells, which lack DNA sequences homologous to murine leukemia virus, incorporated one copy of the viral genome per haploid genome. It is inferred that the presence of viral sequences may affect the efficiency of integration of exogenous provirus, and that there may be a limit to the number of copies that can be inserted."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	189912	A discrepancy in XC and oncogenicity assays for murine leukemia virus in AKR mice.	"Studies of murine leukemia virus expression in AKR mice are presented. Material from in vivo and in vitro sources of normal tissues and lymphomas was assayed for in vitro infectivity, using the XC plaque assay, and for oncogenicity, by assessing lymphoma-accelerating capacity after inoculation into newborn animals. Normal tissues from healthy young AKR mice up to 7 months of age were found to have XC but not oncogenic activity. XC activity persisted, and weak oncogenic activity appeared in older mice. Cocultivation of normal young cells with NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells did not result in the appearance of oncogenic activity, although XC virus increased in titer. A cell-free filtrate of a virus-accelerated lymphoma was studied for host range. Virus as measured by polymerase and gs antigen was found to be propagated on NIH Swiss mouse embryo and wild mouse embryo cells, but not on human rhabdomyosarcoma, normal rat kidney, rabbit corneal, and BALB/c embryo cells. Virus as measured by the XC assay grew better on NIH Swiss mouse than on BALB/c embryo cells. Both of these cell lines propagated virus as measured by the oncogenicity assay. Supernatants from an in vitro cell line from a virus-accelerated lymphoma did not produce XC plaques but were oncogenic. Those from two cell lines of spontaneous lymphomas were negative with both assays. Cultivation of supernatants from these cultured lymphoma cells with NIH Swiss mouse embryo cells resulted in material which produced small plaques on the XC assay. These findings are interpreted as showing the presence of two viruses in AKR mice. One is XC positive and present throughout life. The other is oncogenic, appears later in life, and could be a separate virus or a variant of the first one."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	191115	Genetic influence in murine viral leukemogenesis.	"Studies carried out over the past four decades on factors controlling the susceptibility to viral leukemias in mice have shown the existence of specific controlling gene loci. Evidence from a number of studies using various mouse strains and different leukemia viruses has shown that the controlling genes may act either directly or indirectly. \"In vitro\" experiments have shown controlling effects directed by the prospective target cells themselves in which effective virus infection and/or and/or replication is inhibitied. From \"in vivo\" experiments it is also evident that susceptibility may be controlled through indirect means mediated by immune relationships and other factors involved in the basic regulations of hematopoiesis. The present paper presents a brief review of the various genes known to control susceptibility and resistance to murine leukemia viruses. Certain conflicts in the literature relating to the naming of particular specific genes by different laboratories is also discussed, and some minor revisions in nomenclature designed to resolve some of the existing confusion are proposed."	1

"Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed fibroblast nonproducer cells were used to prepare A-MuLV stocks containing a number of different helper viruses. The oncogenicity of the A-MuLV stocks was tested by animal inoculation and their ability to transform normal mouse bone marrow cells was measured in vitro. All of the A-MuLV stocks transformed fibroblast cells efficiently. However, only A-MuLV stocks prepared with helper viruses that are highly oncogenic were efficient in vivo and in vitro in hematopoietic cell transformation. In addition, inefficient helpers did not establish a stable infection in lymphoid nonproducer cells. Thus, helper virus has a more central role in lymphoid cell transformation than in fibroblast cell transformation."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	211512	Growth factors from murine sarcoma virus-transformed cells.	"Murine sarcoma virus-transformed mouse fibroblasts produce polypeptide growth factors and release them into serum-free medium. These factors stimulate cells to divide in monolayer cultures and also to form colonies that grow progressively soft agar. Three major peaks of activity are seen, with apparent molecular weights of 25,000, 12,000, and 7000. The sarcoma growth factors are heat-stable, trypsin-sensitive, and active in nanogram quantities when tested for growth stimulation of untransformed rat and mouse fibroblasts. All three molecular species are also capable of competing for membrane epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors when tested with 125I-labeled EGF. They differ from mouse EGF, however, in their molecular weights, in their inability to react with anti-EGF antibodies, and in their ability to convert cells to anchorage independent (agar) growth. For the above reasons, we conclude that the sarcoma growth factors are a new class of polypeptide tropic factors that confer on fibroblasts in vitro properties associated with the transformed phenotype."	0

Exposure to Coxsackie viruses B-4 and B-6, reovirus type 2, influenza virus type A, mouse cytomegalovirus, adenovirus type 5, and mouse adenovirus resulted in statistically significant inhibition of blastocyst formation. Development in vitro was unaffected by exposure to ECHO virus type 11, attenuated poliomyelitis virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 1, mumps, rubella, and herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2. Blastocyst formation was also unaffected by exposure of embryos to mouse interferon in a concentration 24 units/ml of culture fluid. Coxsackie virus B-4 was recovered from exposed embryos."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	2453086	Analysis of antiviral resistance in the intestinal tracts of nude mice infected with a mouse adenovirus.	"Upon intestinal infection of heterozygous (nu/+) mice with mouse adenovirus, antiviral resistance can be seen in the form of negative-recovery of virus from feces 2-3 wks post infection. On the other hand, in similar infections in BALB/c nude (nu/nu) mice, the antiviral resistance is manifested as negative-recovery of virus from feces at a later stage, i.e., at around 6 wks post infection. This resistance was not accompanied by rises in interferon titer, rises in natural killer (NK) cell activity, nor was the resistance affected by the introduction of anti-asialo GM1 antibody. No distinct loss of resistance was observed upon administration of carrageenan, but the resistance in the group given carrageenan immediately before and after viral challenge seemed to be slightly reduced. In all infected nu/nu mice, neither neutralizing antibody (NT-Ab) nor complement-dependent NT-Ab could be detected by the usual tube method. On the other hand, a complete abolishment of the antiviral resistance was seen following cyclophosphamide administration. For clarification of the antiviral resistance factor in nu/nu mice, the analysis of antibody other than NT-Ab and complement-dependent NT-Ab, and the problem of resolution of antibody titration remain. Furthermore, it has been noted that the serum IgG titer is high in nu/nu mice and that this level is depressed by cyclophosphamide administration. It is believed that this may be in some way involved with the loss of antiviral resistance observed."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	7747418	Characterization of an 11K protein produced by early region 3 of mouse adenovirus type 1.	"Early region 3 (E3) of mouse adenovirus type 1 produces three mRNAs that can encode three proteins with unique carboxy-terminal exons. A bacterial fusion protein encoding the unique terminus of one the three predicted proteins was used to generate antiserum in rabbits. This antiserum detected a 14K protein on a Western blot of infected cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation and endoglycosidase H digestion revealed that the 14K protein was a glycoprotein with a core molecular weight of 11K, and we are designating this protein E3 gp 11K. Through in vitro translation experiments we determined that the previously predicted signal sequence of gp11K was cleaved when the protein was expressed during an infection. Biochemical and immunofluorescence microscopy data indicated that E3 gp11K was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. Biochemical experiments further indicated that gp11K is a peripheral membrane protein."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	8661390	Conservation of DNA sequence in the predicted major late promoter regions of selected mastadenoviruses.	"The major late promoter (MLP) of the subgroup C human adenoviruses is a preeminent model for the study of the mechanisms of basal and activated transcription, both in vivo and in vitro. However, while the structure and function of the human virus MLP has been the subject of extensive investigation, the conservation of the various promoter elements among the adenoviruses from different species has not been examined. Conservation of specific elements would strongly suggest the importance and universality of their function. To address this issue, sequences were obtained from cloned DNAs of several representative Mastadenoviridae, mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1), Tupaia adenovirus type 1 (TAV-1), and two bovine adenoviruses of two distinct subgroups, BAV-3 and BAV-7. The results of the sequencing studies showed that the TATA box and an upstream inverted CAAT box are conserved in all species and that the binding site for transcription factor USF is present in all except MAV-1, in which a sequence similar to an Sp1-binding site is present at a similar position. The initiator element (INR) sequence is not well conserved, and only one or other of the two downstream activating elements, DE1 and DE2, is predicted to be present in the nonprimate virus MLP regions. Ribonuclease protection assays on RNA isolated from MAV-1-infected cells late in infection indicated that the predicted MLP is functional, and transcription initiation and splice donor sites were identified. The human virus MLP is embedded in the essential DNA polymerase sequence on the opposite DNA strand. The primary amino acid sequences of the C-terminal regions of the predicted DNA polymerases show strong conservation of sequence motifs observed in replicative polymerases ranging from prokaryotes to mammals, and additional regions of strong conservation among the adenovirus polymerases. Pairwise comparisons between the newly sequenced regions of the polymerases and previously published sequences show that BAV-7 is most dissimilar to all others, while TAV-1 has a greater similarity to the primate sequences than to the others. The sequence data from both strands were also used to construct phylogenetic trees, based on BAV-7 as the outgroup. The trees constructed from the two sets of sequences are broadly similar, showing close relationships between primate viruses, but differing in the order of divergence of TAV-1 and MAV-1 branches."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	10231757	Murine viruses in an island population of introduced house mice and endemic short-tailed mice in Western Australia.	"House mice (Mus domesticus) were recently introduced to Thevenard Island, off the northwest coast of Western Australia. This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M. domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. Pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M. domesticus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	10364495	Novel expression of mouse adenovirus type 1 early region 3 gp11K at late times after infection.	"Mutations were introduced into mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) early region 3 (E3) initiator codons by homologous recombination between viral DNA and a plasmid containing a mutagenized E3 region. The resulting mutant virus, pmE312, contained ATG --> TTA mutations at codon positions 1 and 4 and was expected to be null for the expression of the E3 proteins. However, gp11K, an MAV-1 E3 glycoprotein of 14K molecular weight, was detected in mutant-infected cell lysates at levels about 10-12% of that of wild-type (wt) virus at late times in infection. The gp11K polypeptide produced by pmE312 at late times was immunoprecipitated with two E3-specific antisera prepared against different regions of the protein. Like gp11K produced by wt virus infections, it was sensitive to endoglycosidase H (endo H) and thus resident in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In pmE312-infected cells treated with cytosine arabinoside (araC), an inhibitor of DNA replication, the gp11K protein was not detected by immunoprecipitation. This indicates that gp11K expression in pmE312-infected cells at late times was dependent on DNA replication and that it was thus translated from a late transcript. In vitro translation of poly(A)+ RNA from mock-, wild-type-, and pmE312-infected cells showed that gp11K was translated from late mRNA as an approximately 28K fusion between a late protein and gp11K. Our data are consistent with a model in which gp11K is expressed at late times as a late protein-gp11K chimera in both wt- and mutant-infected cells. This chimera is then processed: removal of a large N-terminal sequence results in the observed 14K ER-localized gp11K."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	10612660	The distribution and kinetics of polyomavirus in lungs of intranasally infected newborn mice.	"The primary cell types that sustain polyomavirus (Py) replication following intranasal infection as well as the nature of the host cellular response to Py were unknown. As this is an essential and specific site for virus entry, it seems likely that viral gene function must be adapted to these mucosal tissues. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we determined the cell types in the lung that support Py gene expression and replication following intranasal inoculation of newborn mice within 24 h of birth. Lungs were collected daily from days 1 to 10 postinfection for Py DNA and early T antigen analysis and for histological examination by H&E staining, using methods that preserve the delicate newborn lung architecture. Viral DNA was present in increasing quantities from 2 to 6 dpi in a subset of the Clara cells lining the inner lumen of the bronchi and bronchioles, while T antigen expression was present in a majority of the cells in the bronchi and bronchiole lumen. A distinct and transient pattern of hyperplasia was observed among the cells expressing T antigen and was present from 3 through 6 dpi. Py DNA-containing cells exfoliated into the bronchiole lumen and alveolar ducts, but Py T antigen was not detected in these cells. Py DNA was first detected at 2 dpi, increased through 6 dpi, and abruptly declined through 9 dpi at which time there was no sign of viral DNA in the lungs by in situ hybridization. An unusual infiltration of neutrophils began before the presence of exfoliated cells or Py replication and continued for 2-3 days and was followed by a lymphocytic infiltration at 8-10 dpi lasting 2-3 days. Neither the hyperplasia nor the neutrophil infiltration occurred following infection with the MOP1033 MT-Ag or RB1 LT-Ag mutants of Py. In addition, both the neutrophil infiltration and the transient hyperplasia are in stark contrast to the heavy macrophage infiltration that follows infection of lungs with mouse adenovirus. Thus it appears that Py elicits a distinct host response pattern not seen with other DNA viral infections."	0

mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	18160713	CARD6 is interferon inducible but not involved in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain protein signaling leading to NF-kappaB activation.	"We have previously reported the cloning and characterization of CARD6, a caspase recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein that is structurally related to the interferon (IFN)-inducible GTPases. CARD6 associates with microtubules and with receptor-interacting protein 2 (RIP2). RIP2 mediates NF-kappaB activation induced by the intracellular nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) receptors that sense bacterial peptidoglycan. Here we report that the expression of CARD6 and RIP2 in bone marrow-derived macrophages is rapidly induced by beta IFN and gamma IFN. This IFN-induced upregulation of CARD6 is suppressed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in contrast to LPS's enhancement of IFN-induced RIP2 upregulation. We generated CARD6-deficient (CARD6(-/-)) mice and carried out extensive analyses of signaling pathways mediating innate and adaptive immune responses, including the NOD pathways, but did not detect any abnormalities. Moreover, CARD6(-/-) mice were just as susceptible as wild-type mice to infection by Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Candida albicans, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, or mouse adenovirus type 1. Thus, although structural and in vitro analyses strongly suggest an important role for CARD6 in immune defense, the physiological function of CARD6 remains obscure."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	18258919	Adenovirus IL-13-induced airway disease in mice: a corticosteroid-resistant model of severe asthma.	"Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is considered to be a key driver of the development of airway allergic inflammation and remodeling leading to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR). How precisely IL-13 leads to the development of airway inflammation, AHR, and mucus production is not fully understood. In order to identify key mediators downstream of IL-13, we administered adenovirus IL-13 to specifically induce IL-13-dependent inflammation in the lungs of mice. This approach was shown to induce cardinal features of lung disease, specifically airway inflammation, elevated cytokines, AHR, and mucus secretion. Notably, the model is resistant to corticosteroid treatment and is characterized by marked neutrophilia, two hallmarks of more severe forms of asthma. To identify IL-13-dependent mediators, we performed a limited-scale two-dimensional SDS-PAGE proteomic analysis and identified proteins significantly modulated in this model. Intriguingly, several identified proteins were unique to this model, whereas others correlated with those modulated in a mouse ovalbumin-induced pulmonary inflammation model. We corroborated this approach by illustrating that proteomic analysis can identify known pathways/mediators downstream of IL-13. Thus, we have characterized a murine adenovirus IL-13 lung model that recapitulates specific disease traits observed in human asthma, and have exploited this model to identify effectors downstream of IL-13. Collectively, these findings will enable a broader appreciation of IL-13 and its impact on disease pathways in the lung."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine mastadenovirus a	18268085	Recovery of humoral immunity is critical for successful antiviral therapy in disseminated mouse adenovirus type 1 infection.	"Severe adenovirus infections in transplant recipients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy are of increasing concern. Controversy exists on the contribution of antiviral therapy and the host immune response to recovery from these infections. Here, we established a systemic mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1) infection in cyclophosphamide (CyP)-treated BALB/c mice. CyP was administered at 100 mg per kg of body weight every other day for 2, 3, or 4 weeks, thereby inducing general but reversible leukopenia, with a major suppression of the B-cell numbers and functionality that was more pronounced than that seen with T cells. The outcome of MAV-1 infection was dependent on the duration of CyP therapy, as the mice with the most severe immunosuppression were the most vulnerable to MAV-1-induced hemorrhagic enteritis and mortality. The protective effect of concomitant antiviral therapy with cidofovir depended on the level of immunosuppression. The combination of cidofovir treatment with the withdrawal of immunosuppression was the most successful regimen for increasing survival rates. Survival was clearly correlated with the clearance of virus and increased titers of MAV-1-specific antibodies in sera. In addition, the passive transfer of MAV-1-specific immunoglobulin G into MAV-1-infected SCID BALB/c mice caused a marked delay in mortality, the extent of the delay being dependent on the titer of MAV-1-specific antibodies. Based on the critical role of the humoral immune response in the early defense against disseminated adenovirus infection, the concomitant use of adenovirus-specific immunoglobulins and antiviral therapy should be considered for transplant patients at risk for severe adenovirus infections."	0

"Two persistently infected cell lines established from C3H mouse brain cells infected in vivo with Sendai virus were shown to differ with respect to interferon (IF) production and response to exogenous IF. MB/Sen carrier cells contained 1-5 per cent antigen positive cells when examined by immunofluorescence, and virus was occasionally recovered from the culture medium. MB/SenAS carrier cells were maintained with 0.16 per cent Sendai antiserum in the supernatant medium. All MB/SenAS cells contained viral antigen and infectious virus was present in the culture medium. MB/Sen released IF spontaneously into the culture medium. Further IF production could be stimulated in MB/Sen by superinfection with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Exogenous IF provided good protection against VSV challenge. In contrast, MB/SenAS produced no IF spontaneously but could be stimulated by NDV and VSV to produce IF.

"Sixty 5 to 8 week old Sprague-Dawley (Crl:CD(SD)BR) rats were inoculated intranasally with 2000 egg infectious doses of egg-propagated Sendai virus. Virus was recovered from the upper respiratory tract and lungs on days 1 through 8 post-inoculation (PI). Serum antibody responses were measured for 12 rats over a 9 month period PI. Antibody was first detected at 7 days, peaked at 21 days, and was detected in 5 of the 12 rats at 9 months. A cell-mediated response, as measured by lymphocyte blastogenesis, also was detected at 7 days and peaked at 21 days, but was not detected at 6 months PI. Lung and serum interferon (IFN) was first detected at 3 hours and peaked at 6 hours, but was not detected by 160 hours. Lung IFN levels were 4 to 10 times those in the serum. These studies indicate that pathogenesis of Sendai virus infection in the rat is similar to that reported in the mouse, but that there are differences in the kinetics of both viral replication and morphologic changes, as described in the companion paper."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	2476892	Protective activity of recombinant cytokines against Sendai virus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections in mice.	"The efficacy of recombinant cytokines such as murine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), mouse granulocytic-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and human interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) has been examined for augmentation of host resistance against Sendai virus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. All four cytokines were found to protect mice against Sendai virus infection. IFN-gamma afforded protection when administered intranasally but not intravenously several days before the infection. Intranasal administration of G-CSF one day before the infection was the most effective administration route and timing. Intranasal administration of GM-CSF was found to afford protection 1 or 3 days before the infection. IL-1 beta demonstrated therapeutic activity against Sendai virus infection after intranasal administration on the same day as the infection. When each of the cytokines was administered subcutaneously four times daily into cyclophosphamide-treated mice before intravenous infection with HSV, only GM-CSF revealed any protective activity."	0

"A study was conducted on the protective effect of some ribosomal preparations, isolated from chorionic-allantoic membranes of chicken embryos, infected or not with parainfluenza (Sendai) or influenza (AoPR8) virus, in mice experimentally inoculated with influenza virus strain AoPR8 adapted to the mouse. Results showed that the tested preparation, containing ribosomes and polysomes isolated from chorio-allantoic membranes of Sendai virus inoculated chicken embryos, ensure the mice complete protection against AoPR8 virus, if administrated before the control infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	2994598	The effects of monoclonal antibodies against the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion protein on the release of Sendai virus from infected cells.	"Vero cell cultures in Leighton tubes were infected with egg-grown Sendai virus at high multiplicity of infection. Four hours after infection, the cultures were labelled with 35S-methionine, after which various concentrations of fourteen and five mouse monoclonal antibodies directed against different antigenic determinants of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) protein, respectively, were added to the medium. Fourty-eight hours after infection radiolabelled virions released into the medium were collected and purified by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugations. The amount of virus-bound radioactivity obtained in the various extracellular materials allowed an estimation of the capacity of the different monoclonal antibodies to inhibit the release of Sendai virus. In addition, the release of virions from infected cells was studied ultrastructurally. Based on their serological reactivity the fourteen anti-HN monoclonal antibodies could be divided into four groups. The first group of clones could not inhibit any biological activity of the virus. These clones were binding proximally, near the base of the HN glycoprotein and could not inhibit the release of the virus. The second group blocked hemolysis, but did not block hemagglutination (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) activity. The third group of clones blocked all biological activities of the HN glycoprotein. The fourth group could only block NA activity. With the exception of one of five monoclonal antibodies belonging to the second group, antibodies of the second, third and fourth group were found to bind more distally on the HN glycoprotein. Except for two monoclonal antibodies of the second group they could all effectively inhibit release of the virus from infected cells. Ultrastructurally, these antibodies caused aggregation of virions in contact with the plasma membrane. The five monoclonal antibodies directed against the F protein reacted with four different antigenic sites. These antibodies could not prevent the release of Sendai virus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	3028822	Induction of H-2-specific antibodies by injections of syngeneic Sendai virus-coated cells.	"The capacity of the B cell immunoglobulin receptor to recognize complexes of Sendai viral and H-2b antigens was investigated by studying the antibody response to injections of syngeneic Sendai virus-coated (SV+) spleen cells in C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Almost all mice produced alloreactive anti-H2 lymphocytotoxic antibodies. In contrast, such antibodies were found very exceptionally in mice injected with normal (SV-) cells or with Sendai virus (SV) only. The reaction pattern of the cytotoxic antibodies induced was variable and ranged from almost anti-private to widely cross-reactive serotypes. The results of reactions on H-2-congenic, -recombinant and -mutant mouse strains, and of capping and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the cytotoxic antibodies were directed against H-2 class I molecules. The anti-H-2 antibodies exhibited enhanced binding for SV+ target cells, but absorption experiments showed that this was not the result of cross-reactions with cell surface Sendai viral determinants or with a molecular complex of H-2 plus SV. This conclusion was supported by the observation that syngeneic SV+ cells were not the predominant targets for the induced lymphocytotoxic antibodies. Our results do not support the existence of MHC-restricted antiviral antibodies, but show the induction of anti-class I H-2 alloantibodies by injections with syngeneic SV-coated cells. We present a model for regular induction of anti-H-2 antibodies without intentional alloimmunization."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	4128377	Effects of polyadenylic acids on functions of murine RNA tumor viruses.	"Single-stranded polyribonucleotides, which competitively inhibit murine RNA tumor virus reverse transcriptase in vitro, were tested as inhibitors of various virus functions in cell culture. The compounds had two concentration-dependent effects. At high concentrations (100 mug/ml), both poly(adenylic acid) [poly(A)] and poly(2'-O-methyladenylic acid) [poly(Am)] inhibited the uptake of radioactively labeled leukemia virus by Swiss mouse embryo cells, but neither had a similar effect on Sindbis virus adsorption. At low concentrations (10 mug/ml), poly(Am) did not inhibit the uptake of leukemia virus but did inhibit virus replication by 85%; in contrast, the replication of Sendai virus and Sindbis virus was not inhibited significantly at this concentration. Both compounds were effective only when added prior to or early during virus infection. Poly(Am) was a much more effective inhibitor than poly(A), probably due to the nuclease resistance of the former compound. Poly(Am) at 5 mug/ml also inhibited transformation of 3T3 cells by Moloney sarcoma virus. However, neither poly(A) nor poly(Am) at high concentrations inhibited the activation of endogenous leukemia virus by iododeoxyuridine in AKR mouse embryo cells. These results suggest that virus reverse transcriptase plays an essential role in both the replication of exogenous murine leukemia viruses and the transformation of cells by murine sarcoma viruses but probably has no role in the activation of endogenous leukemia virus."	0

"Rat liver cells in vitro were transformed with chicken sarcoma virus B77, giving RL(B77) cells, and with murine sarcoma virus (Harvey), giving RL(MSV) cells. Rat liver cells transformed spontaneously in vitro were designated RL cells. In addition, the RL(MSV) cell line was adapted for growth in culture fluid containing 25 mug of 5-bromodeoxyuridine per ml. All cell lines were tumorigenic in 1-wk-old rats. The number of cells needed for induction of tumor growth was 1,000-fold higher in the case of RL(B77) cells in comparison with RL(MSV) cells and RL cells. No production of viral particles from any of the cell lines investigated was detected by plating concentrated supernatant fluid of the cultures on different secondary embryo cells with and without fusion by Sendai virus, by labeling with uridine-5-(3)H, or by assay for deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase activity. The viral genome was rescued by fusion of RL(B77) cells with chicken cells. Chicken sarcoma virus rescued from (RL(B77) cells differed in plating efficiency on duck cells from B77 virus rescued from transformed rat embryo cells. No virus was rescued after fusion of RL(MSV) and RL cells with mouse, rat, or chicken embryo cells. Infectious murine sarcoma virus can be induced by 5-bromodeoxyuridine from RL(MSV) cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	6296260	A method for obtaining chimaeric mouse blastocysts with two separate inner cell masses: a preliminary report.	"Pairs of zona-free mouse blastocysts aggregated in the presence of inactivated Sendai virus and subsequently cultured in vitro will fuse to form a chimaeric blastocyst with one common blastocoelic cavity. Depending on the relative position of the inner cell masses in the apposed 'parental' blastocysts, the resulting chimaeric blastocyst contains either a single inner cell mass (ICM) of dual origin or two discrete ICMs each originating from one embryo. In the present experiments, fusion between the two aggregated blastocysts occurred in 23% of the pairs and 64% of these chimaeric blastocysts contained two ICMs. Blastocysts of the latter type could potentially give rise to pairs of embryos which as regards the topography of the foetal membrane would resemble spontaneous identical twins, although they would be genetically dissimilar. Possible applications of the described method are discussed."	0

mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	7730810	Parainfluenza virus type 1 infects olfactory neurons and establishes long-term persistence in the nerve tissue.	"A mouse model of Sendai virus infection was adopted to examine the in vivo neurovirulence of parainfluenza viruses. A nested polymerase chain reaction detected the Sendai virus nucleoprotein gene in the olfactory bulbs of intranasally infected mice for at least 168 days post-infection (p.i.) and virus-specific messenger RNAs for 28 days p.i. Viral proteins were histochemically detected in some olfactory neurons for 7 days p.i. They were also found in glomeruli of the olfactory bulbs but not in the mitral cells and the tufted cells. No virus was detected in the whole brain not including the olfactory bulbs. When mice were inoculated with UV-inactivated virus, the viral RNA was present in the olfactory bulbs for a short period of 14 days, with no demonstrable viraemia. These results demonstrate that the parainfluenza virus directly accesses the central nervous system via olfactory neurons and establishes long-term persistence in the nerve tissue."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	8985426	Protection of mice from respiratory Sendai virus infections by recombinant vaccinia viruses.	"Mechanisms of protection of mice from Sendai virus, which is exclusively pneumotropic and causes a typical respiratory disease, by immunization with recombinant vaccinia viruses (RVVs) were investigated. Although the RVV carrying a hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene of Sendai virus (Vac-HN) propagated in the noses and lungs of mice by either intranasal (i.n.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation, no vaccinia virus antigens were detected in the mucosal layer of upper and lower airways of the i.p.-inoculated mice. The mice immunized i.n. with Vac-HN or Vac-F (the RVV carrying a fusion protein gene of Sendai virus) demonstrated the strong resistance to Sendai virus challenge both in the lung and in the nose, whereas the i.p.-immunized mice showed almost no resistance in the nose but showed a partial resistance in the lung. Titration of Sendai virus-specific antibodies in the nasal wash (NW), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and serum collected from the Vac-F-immunized mice showed that the NW from the i.n.-immunized mice contained immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies but no IgG and the BAL from the mice contained both IgA and IgG antibodies. On the other hand, neither IgA nor IgG antibodies were detected in the NW from the i.p.-immunized mice and only IgG antibodies were detected in the BAL, although both i.n.- and i.p.-immunized mice exhibited similar levels of serum IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies. The resistance to Sendai virus in the noses of i.n.-immunized mice could be abrogated by the intranasal instillation of anti-mouse IgA but not of anti-IgG antiserum, while the resistance in the lung was not significantly abrogated by such treatments. These results demonstrate that IgA is a major mediator for the immunity against Sendai virus induced by the RVVs and IgG is a supplementary one, especially in the lung, and that the RVV should be intranasally inoculated to induce an efficient mucosal immunity even if it has a pantropic nature."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	9032393	Modification of the Sendai virus-specific antibody and CD8+ T-cell responses in mice homozygous for disruption of the interleukin-4 gene.	"Homozygous disruption (-/-) of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene did not obviously modify the severity of Sendai virus infection in the highly susceptible 129/J mouse strain. The virus was cleared from the respiratory tract, and potent cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) effectors were present in the cell population recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage. However, the prevalence of virus-specific CTL precursors (p) was consistently diminished in the spleen and regional lymph nodes of the IL-4 -/- mice at day 7 after infection. Also, virus-specific serum immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) levels were greatly reduced and few IgG1-producing cells were detected in the lymphoid tissue. The effect on IgG1 class switching was to be expected, but the decrease in CTLp numbers has not been observed previously for a virus-specific immune response."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	9592186	HVJ (Sendai virus) liposome-mediated gene transfer: current status and future perspectives (review).	"Haemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus), a member of the mouse paramyxovirus family, has been combined with liposomes to produce a novel gene transfer system, namely HVJ liposomes. This vector system is defined as a <hybrid vector>, constructed with inactivated viral particles and non-viral (artificial) multi- or unilamellar liposomes containing gene expression cassettes and has several advantages in comparison with other viral or non-viral systems. Many studies have shown that this vector system can, not only produce efficient gene transfer using reporter genes, but also with resulting in vivo functional changes in several animal models of diseases. Despite these results, it is likely that the construct will need to be modified to improve gene transfer and expression efficiency and also to extend the potential disease targets. We review the present status of this hybrid vector system and also discuss possible modifications for future application to either in vivo analysis of specific gene expression or human gene therapy strategies for congenital or acquired diseases."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	9861157	Not only inner cell mass cell nuclei but also trophectoderm nuclei of mouse blastocysts have a developmental totipotency.	"The nuclei of mouse trophectoderm cells were found to have developmental totipotency like inner cell mass cells after serial nuclear transfer. Single inner cell mass or trophectoderm cells from expanded blastocysts synchronized with the cell cycle by treatment with nocodazole and aphidicolin to the G1 stage were injected into the perivitelline space of enucleated metaphase II oocytes together with Sendai virus. All oocytes were given three electrical pulses to induce fusion and activation (first nuclear transfer). Aphidicolin was present in all media used until fusion. When reconstituted oocytes developed to the two-cell stage, the nuclei of the reconstituted eggs were fused with the enucleated blastomeres of fertilized two-cell embryos by inactivated Sendai virus (second nuclear transfer). The reconstituted embryos were cultured in vitro and transferred to recipients. After the second nuclear transfer, 23-64% (for inner cell mass cells) and 32-62% (for trophectoderm cells) developed to morula or blastocyst stage. Better development of second nuclear transfer embryos was observed when oocytes fused with trophectoderm nuclei did not extrude a polar body after the first nuclear transfer. After transfer of morulae and blastocysts to recipients, four males were obtained, two from inner cell mass and two from trophectoderm nuclei. These findings indicate that the nucleus of inner cell mass and trophectoderm cells of mouse blastocysts can be reprogrammed within the cytoplasm of unfertilized oocytes and then in fertilized embryos."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	10231757	Murine viruses in an island population of introduced house mice and endemic short-tailed mice in Western Australia.	"House mice (Mus domesticus) were recently introduced to Thevenard Island, off the northwest coast of Western Australia. This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M. domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. Pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M. domesticus."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	10877838	Viral mutation accelerated by nitric oxide production during infection in vivo.	"Nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O(2)(-)), and their reaction product peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) are generated in excess during a host's response against viral infection, and contribute to viral pathogenesis by promoting oxidative stress and tissue injury. Here we demonstrate that NO and peroxynitrite greatly accelerates the mutation of Sendai virus (SeV), a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus, by using green fluorescent protein (GFP) inserted into and expressed by a recombinant SeV (GFP-SeV) as an indicator for mutation. GFP-SeV mutation frequencies were much higher in the wild-type mice than in those lacking inducible NO synthase, suggesting that mutation of the virus in vivo is NO dependent. High levels of NO and NO-mediated oxidative stress were induced by GFP-SeV infection in the lung of the wild-type mice, but not in the iNOS-deficient mice, as evidenced by electron spin resonance spectroscopy and immunohistochemical analysis for nitrotyrosine formation as well as histopathological examination. Furthermore, peroxynitrite, an NO-derived reactive nitrogen intermediate, enhanced viral mutation in vitro. These results indicate that the oxidative stress induced by NO produced during the natural course of viral infection increases mutation, expands the quasispecies spectrum, and facilitates evolution of RNA viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	11690554	Improvements in gene therapy technologies.	"We have combined hemagglutinating virus of Japan (HVJ; Sendai virus) with liposomes for efficient in vitro and in vivo fusion-mediated gene delivery. The HVJ-liposome was a highly efficient vehicle for the introduction of oligonucleotides into cells in vivo as well as for the transfer of genes <100 kbp without damaging cells. By coupling the Epstein-Barr (EB) virus replicon apparatus with HVJ-liposomes (virosomes), transgene expression was sustained in vitro and in vivo. When we added cationic lipids, the HVJ-cationic liposomes increased gene delivery 100 to 800 times in vitro compared with the conventional anionic virosomes and were also more useful for gene expression in restricted areas of organs and for gene therapy of disseminated cancers. We further discovered that the use of anionic virosomes with a virus-mimicking lipid composition (artificial viral envelope; AVE type) increased transfection efficiency approximately 10 fold in vivo, especially in the heart, liver, kidney, and muscle. Most animal organs were found to be suitable targets for the fusigenic virosomes, and numerous gene therapy strategies using this system were successful in animals. The combination of suicide gene therapy with radiation was very effective for killing hepatomas in a mouse model. Arteriosclerosis obliterans in animal models was cured by the transfer of hepatocyte growth factor."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	12033784	All four Sendai Virus C proteins bind Stat1, but only the larger forms also induce its mono-ubiquitination and degradation.	"Sendai virus infection strongly induces interferon (IFN) production and has recently been shown to interdict the subsequent IFN signaling through the Jak/Stat pathway. This anti-IFN activity of SeV is due to its \"C\" proteins, a nested set of four proteins (C', C, Y1, Y2) that carry out a nested set of functions in countering the innate immune response. We previously reported that all four C proteins interact with Stat1 to prevent IFN signaling through the Jak/Stat pathway. Nevertheless, only the longer C proteins reduced Stat1 levels and prevented IFN from inducing an antiviral (VSV) state, or apoptosis, in IFN-competent murine cells. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the various C proteins differentially affect the host antiviral defenses. All four C proteins were found to physically associate with Stat1 during cell culture infections, and in vitro in the absence of other viral gene products (as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation). In addition, the inability of a null mutant (C(F170S)) to bind Stat1 suggests that this interaction is physiologically relevant. We have also shown that the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 can prevent the C protein-induced dismantling of the antiviral (VSV) state in murine cells; thus, the turnover of Stat1 correlates with the C protein-mediated counteraction of the antiviral (VSV) state. The C protein-induced instability of Stat1 was accompanied by a clear increase in the level of mono-ubiquinated Stat1, an unexpected hallmark of protein degradation. Finally, we show that a rSeV with mutant C proteins but wild-type Y proteins (CDelta10-15, that does not counteract the endogenous antiviral (VSV) state of MEFs even though their C proteins bind Stat1 and prevent its activity) is also unable to decrease bulk Stat1 levels or to increase the level of ubiquinated Stat1."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	12784851	Detection of sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice by use of fluorogenic nuclease reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis.	"Sendai virus may induce acute respiratory tract disease in laboratory mice and is a common contaminant of biological materials. Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) also infects the respiratory tract and, like Sendai virus, may induce a persistent wasting disease syndrome in immunodeficient mice. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays have proven useful for detection of Sendai virus and PVM immunodeficient animals and contaminated biomaterials. Fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assays (fnRT-PCR) combine RT-PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, thereby potentially enhancing specificity and eliminating post-PCR processing. Therefore, fnRT-PCR assays specific for Sendai virus and PVM were developed by targeting primer andprobe sequences to unique regions of the Sendai virus nucleocapsid (NP) gene and the PVM attachment (G) gene, respectively. The Sendai virus and PVM fnRT-PCR assays detected only Sendai virusand PVM , respectively. Neither assay detected other viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae or other RNA viruses that naturally infect rodents. The fnRT-PCR assays detected as little as 10 fg of Sendai virus RNA and one picogram of PVM RNA, respectively, andthe Sendai virus fnRT-PCR assay had comparable sensitivity when directly compared with the mouse antibody production test. The fnRT-PCR assays were also able to detect viral RNA in respiratory tract tissues and cage swipe specimens collected from experimentally inoculated C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficient mice, but did not detect viral RNA in age- and strain-matched mock-infected mice. In conclusion, these fnRT-PCR assays offer potentially high-throughput diagnostic assays to detect Sendai virus and PVM in immunodeficient mice, and to detect Sendai virus in contaminated biological materials."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	14581004	IL-12 reduces the severity of Sendai virus-induced bronchiolar inflammation and remodeling.	"The goal of this research was to determine whether differential pulmonary IL-12 gene expression controls susceptibility to Sendai virus-induced chronic airway inflammation and fibrosis in inbred rat strains. Sendai virus-resistant F344 rats and susceptible BN rats were studied from 1 to 14 days following virus inoculation. F344 rats had 3.4-fold higher IL-12 mRNA levels detected by real-time PCR in lung than BN rats as early as two days following inoculation. This increase in mRNA was associated at two days with increased total IL-12 protein and with a 2-fold increase in numbers of bronchiolar, OX-6-positive dendritic cells and an increased number of IL-12 p40-positive, bronchiolar macrophages and dendritic cells (p<0.05). Virus-susceptible BN rats treated with 3 mug of recombinant, mouse IL-12 intraperitoneally at the time of virus inoculation had a 22.1% decrease in severity of chronic bronchiolar inflammation and a 23.8% decrease in fibrosis compared to virus-inoculated BN rats treated with saline. IL-12 treatment induced increased IFN-gamma mRNA and protein expression after virus inoculation (p<0.05). The results demonstrate that there is differential pulmonary IL-12 gene expression between virus-susceptible and resistant rat strains and that IL-12 treatment can provide significant protection from virus-induced chronic airway inflammation and remodeling during early life."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	16006482	Sendai virus-induced alterations in lung structure/function correlate with viral loads and reveal a wide resistance/susceptibility spectrum among mouse strains.	"The Paramyxoviridae family includes some of the most important and ubiquitous disease-causing viruses of infants and children, most of which cause significant infections of the respiratory tract. Evidence is accumulating in humans that genetic factors are involved in the severity of clinical presentation. As a first step toward the identification of the genes involved, this study was undertaken to establish whether laboratory mouse strains differ in susceptibility to Sendai virus, the murine counterpart of human type-1 parainfluenza virus which, historically, has been used extensively in studies that have defined the basic biological properties of paramyxoviruses in general. With this purpose in mind, double-chamber plethysmography data were collected daily for 7 days after inoculation of Sendai virus in six inbred strains of mice. In parallel, histological examinations and lung viral titration were carried out from day 5 to day 7 after inoculation. Pulmonary structure/function values closely reflected the success of viral replication in the lungs and revealed a pattern of continuous variation with resistant, intermediate, and susceptible strains. The results unambiguously suggest that BALB/c (resistant) and 129Sv (susceptible) strains should be used in crossing experiments aimed at identifying the genes involved in resistance to Paramyxoviridae by the positional cloning approach."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	17883878	A new therapy for highly effective tumor eradication using HVJ-E combined with chemotherapy.	"Inactivated HVJ (hemagglutinating virus of Japan; Sendai virus) particles (HVJ envelope vector; HVJ-E can incorporate and deliver plasmid DNA, siRNA, antibody and peptide and anti-cancer drugs to cells both in vitro and in vivo. We attempted to eradicate tumors derived from mouse colon cancer cells, CT26, by combining bleomycin (BLM)-incorporated HVJ-E (HVJ-E/BLM) with cisplatin (CDDP) administration., CT-26 tumor mass was intradermally established in Balb/c mice. HVJ-E/BLM was directly injected into the tumor mass with or without intraperitoneal administration of CDDP. The anti-tumor effect was evaluated by measuring tumor size and cytotoxic T cell activity against CT26. Re-challenge of tumor cells to treated mice was performed 10 days or 8 months after the initial tumor inoculation., We found that three intratumoral injections of HVJ-E/BLM along with a single intraperitoneal administration of CDDP eradicated CT26 tumors with more than 75% efficiency. When tumor cells were intradermally re-injected on day 10 after the initial tumor inoculation, tumors on both sides disappeared in most of the mice that received the combination therapy of HVJ-E/BLM and CDDP. Eight months after the initial tumor eradication, surviving mice were re-challenged with CT26 cells. The re-challenged tumors were rejected in all of the surviving mice treated with the combination therapy. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for CT26 were generated in these surviving mice., Combination therapy consisting of HVJ-E and chemotherapy completely eradicated the tumor, and generated anti-tumor immunity. The combination therapy could therefore be a promising new strategy for cancer therapy."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	18292557	Airway epithelial versus immune cell Stat1 function for innate defense against respiratory viral infection.	"The epithelial surface is often proposed to actively participate in host defense, but evidence that this is the case remains circumstantial. Similarly, respiratory paramyxoviral infections are a leading cause of serious respiratory disease, but the basis for host defense against severe illness is uncertain. Here we use a common mouse paramyxovirus (Sendai virus) to show that a prominent early event in respiratory paramyxoviral infection is activation of the IFN-signaling protein Stat1 in airway epithelial cells. Furthermore, Stat1-/- mice developed illness that resembled severe paramyxoviral respiratory infection in humans and was characterized by increased viral replication and neutrophilic inflammation in concert with overproduction of TNF-alpha and neutrophil chemokine CXCL2. Poor control of viral replication as well as TNF-alpha and CXCL2 overproduction were both mimicked by infection of Stat1-/- airway epithelial cells in culture. TNF-alpha drives the CXCL2 response, because it can be reversed by TNF-alpha blockade in vitro and in vivo. These findings pointed to an epithelial defect in Stat1-/- mice. Indeed, we next demonstrated that Stat1-/- mice that were reconstituted with wild-type bone marrow were still susceptible to infection with Sendai virus, whereas wild-type mice that received Stat1-/- bone marrow retained resistance to infection. The susceptible epithelial Stat1-/- chimeric mice also exhibited increased viral replication as well as excessive neutrophils, CXCL2, and TNF-alpha in the airspace. These findings provide some of the most definitive evidence to date for the critical role of barrier epithelial cells in innate immunity to common pathogens, particularly in controlling viral replication."	0

"Otitis media (OM) is a highly prevalent paediatric disease with both bacterial and viral triggers of infection. This study has investigated how combinations of bacteria associated with nasal colonisation and the occurrence and absence of viral infection (Sendai virus) induce OM in a mouse nasal colonisation model. The respiratory virus significantly contributed to bacterial OM for all bacterial combinations (p<0.001). Streptococcus pneumoniae consistently dominated as the causative bacterium of OM and when co-infected with S. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis more significantly affected pneumococcal OM than did non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (p<0.001) by increasing the incidence rate, infection bacterial load and duration of infection. Nitric oxide levels in the middle ear, an indicator of inflammation, peaked at day 3 in single bacterium groups, but at day 1 in mixed bacterial groups and was produced in all bacteria inoculated groups even in the absence of viable bacterial recovery. Phagocytic cells were recruited rapidly to the ear following nasal inoculation but over time their numbers did not correlate with persistence of bacterial infection. The study has shown that the composition of bacteria in the nasal cavity and respiratory viral infection significantly affected the OM incidence rate, duration of infection and bacterial load (severity)."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	19675593	Highly efficient eradication of intracranial glioblastoma using Eg5 siRNA combined with HVJ envelope.	"Hemagglutinating virus of Japan envelope (HVJ-E) vector with inactivated replication-defective Sendai virus was originally developed as a versatile drug delivery system. Recently, we have shown the direct tumor-killing activity of HVJ-E itself without therapeutic molecules in prostate cancer cells. Although human glioblastoma cells were also sensitive to HVJ-E treatment, complete eradication was not achieved using HVJ-E alone. Here, to develop more effective therapeutic strategy of glioblastoma, we enhanced the anti-tumor activity by incorporating Short interfering RNA (siRNA) of mitotic motor protein Eg5 into HVJ-E. Treatment with HVJ-E-containing Eg5 siRNA induced monopolar spindle formation and resulted in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. When HVJ-E-containing Eg5 siRNA was directly injected into an intradermal tumor xenograft, all mice became tumor-free. Similar results were observed in the intracranial tumor xenografts. The survival time of treated mice was significantly prolonged when HVJ-E was used. Histological examination showed that tumors remained in the brain after treatment with HVJ-E-containing negative control siRNA, but no tumors were detected after treatment with HVJ-E-containing Eg5 siRNA. This remarkable anti-tumor response was likely due to a synergistic effect of Eg5 siRNA and HVJ-E. Thus, this combination shows promise as an attractive novel therapy for glioblastoma."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	20107606	Melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) is involved in the innate immune response to Paramyxoviridae infection in vivo.	"The early host response to pathogens is mediated by several distinct pattern recognition receptors. Cytoplasmic RNA helicases including RIG-I and MDA5 have been shown to respond to viral RNA by inducing interferon (IFN) production. Previous in vitro studies have demonstrated a direct role for MDA5 in the response to members of the Picornaviridae, Flaviviridae and Caliciviridae virus families ((+) ssRNA viruses) but not to Paramyxoviridae or Orthomyxoviridae ((-) ssRNA viruses). Contrary to these findings, we now show that MDA5 responds critically to infections caused by Paramyxoviridae in vivo. Using an established model of natural Sendai virus (SeV) infection, we demonstrate that MDA5(-/-) mice exhibit increased morbidity and mortality as well as severe histopathological changes in the lower airways in response to SeV. Moreover, analysis of viral propagation in the lungs of MDA5(-/-) mice reveals enhanced replication and a distinct distribution involving the interstitium. Though the levels of antiviral cytokines were comparable early during SeV infection, type I, II, and III IFN mRNA expression profiles were significantly decreased in MDA5(-/-) mice by day 5 post infection. Taken together, these findings indicate that MDA5 is indispensable for sustained expression of IFN in response to paramyxovirus infection and provide the first evidence of MDA5-dependent containment of in vivo infections caused by (-) sense RNA viruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	21307205	The IRF-3/Bax-mediated apoptotic pathway, activated by viral cytoplasmic RNA and DNA, inhibits virus replication.	"Induction of apoptosis in cells infected by Sendai virus (SeV), which triggers the cytosolic RIG-I pathway, requires the presence of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Independent of IRF-3's transcriptional role, a novel IRF-3 activation pathway causes its interaction with the proapoptotic protein Bax and its mitochondrial translocation to induce apoptosis. Here we report that two other RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), may also activate the same pathway. Moreover, cytosolic DNA, produced by adenovirus or introduced by transfection, activated the pathway in an RNA polymerase III-dependent fashion. To evaluate the contribution of this newly discovered apoptotic pathway to the host's overall antiviral response, we measured the efficiencies of replication of various viruses in vitro and viral pathogenesis in vivo, using cells and mice that are selectively deficient in components required for the apoptotic pathway of IRF-3. Our results clearly demonstrate that the IRF-3/Bax-mediated apoptotic signaling branch contributes significantly to the host's protection from viral infection and consequent pathogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	21930873	Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block replication of influenza a and other viruses.	"We have previously reported that two receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs), called AG879 and tyrphostin A9 (A9), can each block the replication of influenza A virus in cultured cells. In this study, we further characterized the in vitro antiviral efficacies and specificities of these agents. The 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of each against influenza A was found to be in the high nanomolar range, and the selectivity index (SI = 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)]/EC(50)) was determined to be >324 for AG879 and 50 for A9, indicating that therapeutically useful concentrations of each drug produce only low levels of cytotoxicity. Each compound showed efficacy against representative laboratory strains of both human influenza A (H1N1 or H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Importantly, no drug-resistant influenza virus strains emerged even after 25 viral passages in the presence of AG879, whereas viruses resistant to amantadine appeared after only 3 passages. AG879 and A9 each also exhibited potent inhibitory activity against a variety of other RNA and DNA viruses, including Sendai virus (Paramyxoviridae), herpes simplex virus (Herpesviridae), mouse hepatitis virus (Coronaviridae), and rhesus rotavirus (Reoviridae), but not against Pichinde virus (Arenaviridae). These results together suggest that RTKIs may be useful as therapeutics against viral pathogens, including but not limited to influenza, due to their high selectivity indices, low frequency of drug resistance, and broad-spectrum antiviral activities."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	murine respirovirus	22252710	Sendai virus vector-mediated brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression ameliorates memory deficits and synaptic degeneration in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.	"Growing evidence suggests that decreased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Therefore, BDNF gene therapy is considered to be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating AD. Sendai virus (SeV) is a type I parainfluenza virus that does not interact with host chromosomes because of its strict cytoplasmic life cycle. Although SeV is nonpathogenic in primates, including humans, its infectivity for neurons is strong. Here we demonstrate that SeV vectors effectively infected neurons, even though they were injected into subcortical white matter. Moreover, SeV vectors significantly induced BDNF expression, ameliorating synaptic degeneration and memory deficits in a transgenic mouse model of AD (Tg2576). This is the first study to demonstrate that viral vector administration in white matter is sufficient to restore cognitive function in vivo. These results also support the feasibility of using SeV vectors for gene therapy targeting the brain."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mus musculus polyomavirus 1	1709702	Identification and characterization of the hamster polyomavirus middle T antigen.	"Hamster polyomavirus (HaPV) is associated with lymphoid and hair follicle tumors in Syrian hamsters. The early region of HaPV has the potential to encode three polypeptides (which are related to the mouse polyomavirus early proteins) and can transform fibroblasts in vitro. We identified the HaPV middle T antigen (HamT) as a 45-kDa protein. Like its murine counterpart, HamT was associated with serine/threonine phosphatase, phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and protein tyrosine kinase activities. However, whereas mouse middle T antigen associates predominantly with pp60c-src and pp62c-yes, HamT was associated with a different tyrosine kinase, p59fyn. The ability of HaPV to cause lymphoid tumors may therefore reside in its ability to associate with p59fyn, a potentially important tyrosine kinase in lymphocytes."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mus musculus polyomavirus 1	8189532	Interactions among the major and minor coat proteins of polyomavirus.	"Murine polyomavirus contains two related minor coat proteins, VP2 and VP3, in addition to the major coat protein, VP1. The sequence of VP3 is identical to that of the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of VP2. VP2 may serve a role in uncoating of the virus, and both minor coat proteins may be important for viral assembly. In this study, we show that VP3 and a series of deletion mutants of VP3 can be expressed in Escherichia coli as fusion proteins to glutathione S-transferase and partially solubilized with a mild detergent. Using an in vitro binding assay, we demonstrate that a 42-amino-acid fragment near the carboxy terminus of VP3 (residues 140 to 181) is sufficient for binding to purified VP1 pentamers. This binding interaction is rapid, saturable, and specific for the common carboxy terminus of VP2 and VP3. The VP1-VP3 complex can be coimmunoprecipitated with an antibody specific to VP1, and a purified VP3 fragment can selectively extract VP1 from a crude cell lysate. The stoichiometry of the binding reaction suggests that each VP1 pentamer in the virus binds either one VP2 or one VP3, with the VP1-VP2/3 complex stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. These results, taken together with studies from other laboratories on the expression of polyomavirus capsid proteins in mouse and insect cells (S. E. Delos, L. Montross, R. B. Moreland, and R. L. Garcea, Virology, 194:393-398, 1993; J. Forstova, N. Krauzewicz, S. Wallace, A. J. Street, S. M. Dilworth, S. Beard, and B. E. Griffin, J. Virol. 67:1405-1413, 1993), support the idea that a VP1-VP2/3 complex forms in the cytoplasm and, after translocation into the nucleus, acts as the unit for viral assembly."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mus musculus polyomavirus 1	9055998	Activities of various compounds against murine and primate polyomaviruses.	"Polyomavirus infections in humans are due to BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV). Diseases associated with human polyomaviruses occur mostly in immunocompromised adults, e.g., progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JCV, in AIDS patients and hemorrhagic cystitis and uretral stenosis, caused by BKV, in transplant recipients. No therapy is available for these diseases, which necessitates the development of chemical entities that are active against polyomaviruses. Several antiviral compounds were evaluated to determine their effects on the in vitro replication of mouse polyomavirus and the primate viruses simian virus 40 (SV40), SV40 PML-1, and SV40 PML-2. The activity of the different compounds was assessed by a cytopathic effect reduction assay and confirmed in a virus yield assay. Cidofovir [HPMPC; (S)-1-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)cytosine] and its cyclic counterpart emerged as the most selective antipolyomavirus agents. The 50% inhibitory concentrations for HPMPC were in the range of 4 to 7 micrograms/ml, and its selectivity index varied from 11 to 20 for mouse polyomavirus and from 23 to 33 for SV40 strains in confluent cell monolayers. Cell cytotoxicity was up to 15-fold greater in growing cells. Other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i.e., HPMPA; [(S)-9-(3-hydroxy-2-phosphonylmethoxypropyl)adenine] and PMEG [9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-guanine]) also showed some activity but had low selectivity. None of the other drugs tested against these animal viruses (i.e., acyclovir, ganciclovir, brivudine, ribavirin, foscarnet, and cytarabine) showed significant activity. Thus, HPMPC deserves further evaluation as a candidate drug for polyomavirus infections in the immunocompromised host."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mus musculus polyomavirus 1	10580053	Polyomavirus large- and small-T relieve middle-T-induced cell cycle arrest in normal fibroblasts.	"Papovavirus tumour antigens have been widely used to study cell growth regulation in cultured cells. We investigated the role of mouse polyomavirus T antigens, small-, middle- and large-T, in stimulating growth-arrested REF52 fibroblasts to enter the S phase. Microinjecting cells with cDNAs encoding the various T antigens showed: first, that middle-T expression blocked cell cycle stimulation by serum; second, that middle-T-arrested cells were released into the S phase upon coexpression of small-T; third, that expression of middle-T together with large-T committed resting cells to enter the cell cycle even in the absence of serum. Our data indicate that extensive cooperation among polyomavirus T antigens is essential for T antigen-mediated cell cycle stimulation in growth-arrested cells. In addition, the data suggest a new role for small-T in signalling to mitogenic pathways."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mus musculus polyomavirus 1	11210944	The hamster polyomavirus--a brief review of recent knowledge.	"The hamster polyomavirus (HaPV) was first described in 1967 as a virus associated with skin epithelioma of the Syrian hamster. The tumors appear spontaneously in a hamster colony bred in Berlin-Buch (HaB). Virus particles isolated from skin epitheliomas cause lymphoma and leukemia when injected into newborn hamsters from a distinct colony bred in Potsdam, Germany (HaP). The viral genome has been totally sequenced and the overall genetic organization establishes HaPV as a member of the polyomaviruses. HaPV is a second example of an middle T (MT) antigen encoding polyomavirus and nucleotide sequence homologies designates the mouse polyomavirus (Py) as the closest relative. Lymphomas induced by HaPV in HaP hamsters do not contain virus particles but instead accumulate different amounts of nonrandomly deleted free and/or integrated viral genomes. Transgenic mice produced by microinjection of HaPV DNA into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of Gat: NMRI mice developed both, epitheliomas and lymphomas. Both tumor types contain extrachromosomal DNA. HaPV DNA was found to replicate in hamster lymphoid and fibroblast cell lines. Fully reproductive cycles could be detected only in GD36 lymphoblastic leukemia cells. HaPV carries the full transforming properties of a polyomavirus in vitro. Immortalization of primary rat cells is essentially carried out by the HaPV large T (LT) antigen and coexpression of HaPV MT and HaPV small T (ST) antigen is required for full transformation of rat fibroblasts. The preferential binding of HaPV MT to c-Fyn, a Src family kinase, has been proposed as a mechanism leading to lymphoid malignancies. Heterologous expression of HaPV-VP1 allowed the formation of virus like particles (VLPs) resembling HaPV particles. The high flexibility of HaPV-VP1 for insertion of foreign peptides offers a broad range of potential applications, especially in vaccine development."	0

Procedures For Quantitation And Detection Of Virus. Journal of Experimental Medicine 109:379-391.	"THREE PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN COMPARED FOR USEFULNESS IN TITRATION AND DETECTION OF POLYOMA VIRUS: production of cytopathic effect (CPE) in mouse embryo tissue culture, production of HI antibody after inoculation into weanling mice (MAP test), and production of tumors in suckling hamsters during a 3 to 5 week observation period. The tissue culture and mouse antibody production tests were generally comparable in sensitivity, reproducibility, and time required to obtain results. Titration by tumor production in suckling hamsters was not suitable for quantitation because of marked variation in susceptibility among animals. Virus was detected in tissues of normal mice from spontaneously infected colonies by either production of CPE in mouse embryo tissue culture or by the MAP test; virus was found in organs of 15 (58 per cent) of 26 mice with antibody, and 2 (8 per cent) of 24 mice without antibody."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	mus musculus polyomavirus 1	18468739	Cellular and humoral immune responses to chimeric EGFP-pseudocapsids derived from the mouse polyomavirus after their intranasal administration.	"Mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) VP1-pseudocapsids carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP-VLPs) were used for intranasal immunization of mice. EGFP-VLPs induced strong anti-VP1 but not anti-EGFP antibody production. In vitro restimulation with antigen-pulsed bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) induced remarkable T-cell proliferative response specific for both VP1 and EGFP antigen and IL-2 and IFN-gamma production. Surprisingly, no specific cytotoxic activities against VP1 and EGFP proteins were detected. After intranasal administration of EGFP-VLPs, as well as after polyomavirus infection, a moderate reduction of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) T cells was observed in spleens but not in lymph nodes and peripheral blood, suggesting that both MPyV virions and pseudocapsids are able to induce changes in distribution of regulatory T cells. Treatment of EGFP-VLPs pulsed BMDCs with inhibitors of endosomal acidification proved that presentation of peptides on MHCgp class II is dependent on acidic endosomal environment. Substantial decrease of CD4-specific T-cell proliferation in the presence of proteasome inhibitor suggests that MHCgp class II might load VPL-derived peptides processed by proteasomes. Thus, polyomavirus derived VLPs appear to be promising delivery and adjuvant vehicles for therapeutic proteins."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	norwalk virus	19773133	Zoonotic aspects of infections with noroviruses and sapoviruses.	"The close genetic relationship of noroviruses and sapoviruses found in animals and humans has raised the question whether these viruses have a zoonotic potential. Transmission from animals to humans and vice versa would have far-reaching consequences for epidemiology and food safety. So far animal noro- and sapoviruses have not been found in humans. However detection of human noroviruses in animals as well as simultaneous presence of animal and human viruses in bivalve molluscs suggest a risk of transmission. Furthermore, antibodies against animal noroviruses were detected in humans as well as antibodies against human noroviruses in swine. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic calves and pigs with human noroviruses demonstrated that virus replication and seroconversion can occur. Accordingly the possible role of noro- and sapoviruses as zoonotic agents needs to be further investigated."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	rodent protoparvovirus 1	11924790	Detection of rodent parvoviruses by use of fluorogenic nuclease polymerase chain reaction assays.	"Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have proven useful for detection of rodent parvoviruses in animals and contaminated biological materials. Fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays combine PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, eliminating post-PCR processing and potentially enhancing specificity. Consequently, three fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays were developed, one that detects all rodent parvoviruses, one that specifically detects minute virus of mice (MVM), and one that specifically detects mouse parvovirus 1 (MPV) and hamster parvovirus (HaPV). When rodent parvoviruses and other rodent DNA viruses were evaluated, the rodent parvovirus assay detected only rodent parvovirus isolates, whereas the MVM and MPV/HaPV assays detected only the MVM or MPV/ HaPV isolates, respectively. Each assay detected the equivalent of 10 or fewer copies of target template, and all fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays exceeded the sensitivities associated with previously reported PCR assays and mouse antibody production testing. In addition, each fluorogenic nuclease PCR assay detected the targeted parvovirus DNA in tissues obtained from mice experimentally infected with MVM or MPV. Results of these studies indicate that fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays provide a potentially high-throughput, PCR-based method to detect rodent parvoviruses in infected mice and contaminated biological materials."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	saint louis encephalitis virus	4364644	Lead aggravates viral disease and represses the antiviral activity of interferon inducers.	"Lead acetate was administered continuously in the drinking water to CD-1 male mice beginning at 4 weeks of age. An LD(10-20) of the lytic viruses or 300 plaque-forming units of RLV was inoculated intrapertioneally at 6 weeks of age. Lead increased the response of the mice to all classes of viruses against which it was tested: an RNA picornavirus-encephalomyocarditis (EMCV), a DNA herpesvirus-pseudoribies, an RNA leukemia-virus-Rauscher leukemia (RLV), an RNA arbovirus B-St. Louis encephalitis, and an RNA arbovirus A-western encephalitis. Most studies were performed between lead and EMCV. Increases in EMCV mortality in lead treated mice over controls ranged from 2x at a lead level of 0.004M to 7x (100% mortality) at a 0.1M lead level. Splenomegaly with spleens 800 to 1100 mg in weight containing high titers of RLV occurred in lead (0.03M)-treated mice 3 and 6 weeks after RLV inoculation; spleens or RLV controls were normal in weight (200 mg) and were free of virus. Lead did not reduce the protective effect of mouse interferon (IF) against the lethal action of EMCV, but it did repress the EMCV antiviral effect of poly I/poly C (PIC) and of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) against EMCV mortality. These data indicate several new facts concerning adverse effects lead may have on an animal: (1) lead aggravates viral disease, most likely in part, through reduced IF synthesis; (2) lead represses the anti-EMCV protective effects of both PIC and of NDV, which, in other reports, were shown to induce IF in radioresistant macrophages (PIC) or in radiosensitive lymphocytes (NDV); (3) lead may then be said to repress IF induction in two kinds of cells; (4) however, lead does not inhibit IF action."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	saint louis encephalitis virus	8345362	St Louis encephalitis virus establishes a productive, cytopathic and persistent infection of Sf9 cells.	"The Sf9 cell line, commonly used for gene expression by recombinant baculovirus, has been productively infected by St Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus, a flavivirus. SLE viral infection produced a c.p.e. in the Sf9 cells characterized by giant cells and the presence of 10-fold fewer cells in the infected cultures after the first week of infection compared with uninoculated control cultures. Infected Sf9 cells expressed SLE viral antigens, and intracellular virus particles were observed by electron microscopy. Titres of cell-associated SLE virus rose slightly over an 8 week period, whereas titres of cell-free virus remained stable, suggesting that SLE virus establishes a productive and persistent infection of Sf9 cells. The SLE virus produced by the Sf9 cells could be neutralized by SLE virus-immune mouse ascitic fluid, and no evidence of escape mutants was detected. Sf9 cells persistently infected with SLE virus could be superinfected with a recombinant baculovirus and expressed recombinant antigen. The successful infection of Sf9 cells by SLE virus represents the first report of production of c.p.e. by SLE virus in insect cells under routine cell culture conditions and of the infection of Sf9 cells by a human pathogen."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	saint louis encephalitis virus	12111422	St. Louis encephalitis virus induced pathology in cultured cells.	"Apoptosis is a highly regulated process of cellular self-destruction with diverse functions in multicellular organisms. It is known to be one of the mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), an arthropod-borne flavivirus, causes encephalitis disease of varying severity mostly in North America and in some regions of South America. This virus induces cytopathic effects in vertebrate cell lines, however, the mechanism by which this occurs is yet to be elucidated. SLEV induced cytopathic effects in K562 cells, a human mononuclear cell line, and in Neuro 2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line. SLEV-infected K562 and Neuro 2a cells underwent apoptotic cell death, whereas neither the cells inoculated with UV-inactivated virus nor the mock-infected cells developed cytopathic effects. The gene expression of regulators of apoptosis was investigated in K562 cells. A rise in the expression of the pro-apoptotic bax gene was detected specifically in the SLEV-infected K562 cells. These findings suggest that up-regulation of bax mRNA is correlated with cytopathic effects in SLEV-infected K562 cells."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	saint louis encephalitis virus	17485503	In vitro resistance selection and in vivo efficacy of morpholino oligomers against West Nile virus.	"We characterize in vitro resistance to and demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of two antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) against West Nile virus (WNV). Both PMOs were conjugated with an Arg-rich peptide. One peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) binds to the 5' terminus of the viral genome (5'-end PPMO); the other targets an essential 3' RNA element required for genome cyclization (3' conserved sequence I [3' CSI] PPMO). The 3' CSI PPMO displayed a broad spectrum of antiflavivirus activity, suppressing WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as demonstrated by reductions in viral titers of 3 to 5 logs in cell cultures, likely due to the absolute conservation of the 3' CSI PPMO-targeted sequences among these viruses. The selection and sequencing of PPMO-resistant WNV showed that the 5'-end-PPMO-resistant viruses contained two to three mismatches within the PPMO-binding site whereas the 3' CSI PPMO-resistant viruses accumulated mutations outside the PPMO-targeted region. The mutagenesis of a WNV infectious clone demonstrated that the mismatches within the PPMO-binding site were responsible for the 5'-end PPMO resistance. In contrast, a U insertion or a G deletion located within the 3'-terminal stem-loop of the viral genome was the determinant of the 3' CSI PPMO resistance. In a mouse model, both the 5'-end and 3' CSI PPMOs (administered at 100 or 200 microg/day) partially protected mice from WNV disease, with minimal to no PPMO-mediated toxicity. A higher treatment dose (300 microg/day) caused toxicity. Unconjugated PMOs (3 mg/day) showed neither efficacy nor toxicity, suggesting the importance of the peptide conjugate for efficacy. The results suggest that a modification of the peptide conjugate composition to reduce its toxicity yet maintain its ability to effectively deliver PMO into cells may improve PMO-mediated therapy."	0

mus musculus	Rodentia	tick-borne encephalitis virus	9010282	Characterization of monoclonal antibody-escape mutants of tick-borne encephalitis virus with reduced neuroinvasiveness in mice.	"Escape mutants of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus were selected using neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that react with three different and previously unrecognized epitopes in the envelope protein E of TBE virus. Two of these variants (V-IC3 and V-IE3) exhibited a significantly reduced reactivity with their selecting MAbs, as determined by ELISA, whereas with one variant (V-IO3), reactivity was completely unchanged. Comparative sequence analyses demonstrated that each of the variants differed from the wild-type virus by a single amino acid substitution located at exposed positions within domains I, II and III of protein E. In the mouse model, all three mutants were still neuro-virulent but exhibited a significantly reduced neuro-invasiveness after subcutaneous inoculation. Virus replication, however, was sufficient to induce a specific antibody response. The observed alterations in virulence properties were not associated with reduced growth rates in vertebrate cell cultures, but one variant (V-IE3) exhibited a small plaque phenotype. The mutation of variant V-IO3 resulted in a temperature-sensitive phenotype and a significant elevation of the pH-threshold of the conformational change necessary for fusion activity."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	tick-borne encephalitis virus	9499069	Spontaneous and engineered deletions in the 3' noncoding region of tick-borne encephalitis virus: construction of highly attenuated mutants of a flavivirus.	"The flavivirus genome is a positive-strand RNA molecule containing a single long open reading frame flanked by noncoding regions (NCR) that mediate crucial processes of the viral life cycle. The 3' NCR of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus can be divided into a variable region that is highly heterogeneous in length among strains of TBE virus and in certain cases includes an internal poly(A) tract and a 3'-terminal conserved core element that is believed to fold as a whole into a well-defined secondary structure. We have now investigated the genetic stability of the TBE virus 3' NCR and its influence on viral growth properties and virulence. We observed spontaneous deletions in the variable region during growth of TBE virus in cell culture and in mice. These deletions varied in size and location but always included the internal poly(A) element of the TBE virus 3' NCR and never extended into the conserved 3'-terminal core element. Subsequently, we constructed specific deletion mutants by using infectious cDNA clones with the entire variable region and increasing segments of the core element removed. A virus mutant lacking the entire variable region was indistinguishable from wild-type virus with respect to cell culture growth properties and virulence in the mouse model. In contrast, even small extensions of the deletion into the core element led to significant biological effects. Deletions extending to nucleotides 10826, 10847, and 10870 caused distinct attenuation in mice without measurable reduction of cell culture growth properties, which, however, were significantly restricted when the deletion was extended to nucleotide 10919. An even larger deletion (to nucleotide 10994) abolished viral viability. In spite of their high degree of attenuation, these mutants efficiently induced protective immune responses even at low inoculation doses. Thus, 3'-NCR deletions represent a useful technique for achieving stable attenuation of flaviviruses that can be included in the rational design of novel flavivirus live vaccines."	0

A total of 15 nucleotide substitutions distinguished genomes of these variants, six substitutions resulted in protein sequence alterations, and two were in 5'NTR. Two amino acid substitutions in E protein were responsible for the observed phenotypic differences. Data obtained during reverse passaging of the tick-adapted virus in vivo and in vitro suggest that TBE virus exists as a heterogeneous population that contains virus variants most adapted to reproduction in either ticks or mammals. Host switch results in a change in the ratio of these variants in the population. Plaque purification of the tick-adapted virus resulted in the prompt emergence of new mutants with different virulence for mammals."	0

"Small animal models that are reminiscent of flaviviral disease in human will be instrumental in identifying therapeutic strategies against flavivirus infections. Here we review models in mice and hamsters for the most clinically important flaviviruses: dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and tick-borne encephalitis virus. In addition, models are discussed that employ no known vector viruses such as the Modoc virus. These viruses can be manipulated in BSL-2 laboratories and in infected mice and hamsters they mimic flaviviral disease in human."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	tick-borne encephalitis virus	19996560	Early mortality following intracerebral infection with the Oshima strain of tick-borne encephalitis virus in a mouse model.	"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a zoonotic agent that causes acute central nervous system (CNS) disease in humans. In this study, we examined the pathogenic process following intracerebral infection with the Oshima strain of TBEV in a mouse model. Intracerebral infection resulted in dose-dependent mortality, and all mice died following challenge with 10(2) PFU or more of the virus within 10 days. Acutely necrotic neurons and widespread inflammation were observed throughout the CNS. We therefore conclude that mortality following intracerebral infection results from a direct CNS pathology."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	tick-borne encephalitis virus	20854017	Transcriptional upregulation of SOCS 1 and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA in the absence of suppressors of cytokine signaling 2 mRNA after infection with West Nile virus or tick-borne encephalitis virus.	"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are a family of proteins that are able to act in a classic negative feedback loop to regulate cytokine signal transduction. The regulation of the immune response by SOCS proteins may contribute to persistent infection or even a fatal outcome. In this study, we have investigated the induction of SOCS 1-3 after peripheral infection with West Nile virus (WNV) or tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in the murine model. We have shown that the cytokine response after infection of mice with WNV or TBEV induces an upregulation in the brain of mRNA transcripts for SOCS 1 and SOCS 3, but not SOCS 2. We hypothesize that SOCS proteins may play a role in limiting cytokine responses in the brain as a neuroprotective mechanism, which may actually enhance the ability of neuroinvasive viruses such as WNV and TBEV to spread and cause disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	1781321	Spinal cord slices with attached dorsal root ganglia: a culture model for the study of pathogenicity of encephalitic viruses.	"We describe here a culture system for long-term growth of organotypic slices of spinal cord, with attached dorsal root ganglia (DRG) derived from 13-14 day mouse fetuses. This is a unique in vitro tool in which both central and peripheral nervous tissue grow and differentiate in culture to become heavily myelinated. During cultivation the slices and the ganglia become flattened so as to allow microscopical and immunocytochemical staining. When both central and peripheral myelin had been formed (usually around the third week of cultivation), cultures were infected with 5 x 10(6) PFU of West Nile Virus (WNV). Progeny virions appeared first in about 10% of the neurons and were subsequently observed between lamellae in the central myelin sheath of several axons. Such viral arrangement in relation to myelin membranes, might provide a novel concept for a possible mechanism underlying slow viral infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	4318951	Intrinsic interference: a new type of viral interference.	"The hemadsorption-negative plaque test has revealed a new type of viral interference, termed intrinsic interference. Several unrelated types of noncytopathic viruses were shown to induce in infected host cells a state of interference unique in being directed solely against superinfection by Newcastle disease virus (NDV). The NDV-refractory state arises only in those individual cells of a population actually infected by the inducing virus, and presumably results from the action of a protein(s) coded for by the viral genome. Thus, intrinsic interference differs fundamentally from that mediated by an extrinsic protein detectable under conditions favoring resistance to a broad spectrum of viruses and characteristic of interference induced by interferon, the latter being coded for by the cell genome. Intrinsic interference is defined as a viral genome-induced cellular state of resistance to challenge by high multiplicities of NDV, coexistent with a state of susceptibility to a broad spectrum of other viruses, similarly tested at high multiplicities. The capacity to induce intrinsic interference was demonstrated with rubella virus, Sindbis virus (arbovirus, group A), West Nile virus (arbovirus, group B), poliovirus (MEF, type 2), the lactic dehydrogenase virus (Riley's agent), and an unidentified nonhemadsorbing, noncytopathic adventitious virus. A state of intrinsic interference was also observed in the V5 line of mouse cells carrying a murine leukemia virus, probably resulting from some heretofore unsuspected contaminating virus. The molecular basis for intrinsic interference is not known, but it appears to involve a step in the NDV growth cycle beyond that of viral attachment, entry, and eclipse."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	7817895	Monoclonal antibodies directed against tick-borne encephalitis virus with neutralizing activity in vivo.	"Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) were raised against the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus, strain K23. The reactivities of 14 selected MoAbs were characterized by ELISA, Western blot analysis, haemagglutination inhibition, immunoprecipitation, in vivo protection and in vitro neutralization tests. All MoAbs reacted only with the glycoprotein E. The binding epitope of one MoAb could be delimited by a synthetic peptide to amino acids 306-339 representing one immunodominant loop structure of the glycoprotein E. The MoAbs exhibited individual reactivities against 13 different TBE virus isolates in ELISA and immunoblot test ranging from type-specific reactions to a broad reactivity with all isolates. Four MoAbs also showed a cross-reaction with other flaviviruses like West Nile virus and/or Yellow fever virus in immunoblot analysis. By competition ELISA the MoAbs could be divided into five different reaction patterns. Four MoAbs showed neutralizing activity with titers in the range 1:140 to 1:5,000 in an in vitro assay. These neutralizing activities could be confirmed by an in vivo mouse challenge model. The MoAbs are useful for diagnostic purposes and for differentiation of TBE virus strains and other flaviviruses."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	7944955	Loss of active neuroinvasiveness in attenuated strains of West Nile virus: pathogenicity in immunocompetent and SCID mice.	"The neuropathogenicity of West Nile virus (WNV) and two derived attenuated strains WN25 and WN25A, was studied in young adult ICR mice and in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Similarity in serology and RNA fingerprints were found between WNV and WN25. The viral envelope proteins of the attenuates differed from WNV in their slower mobility in SDS-PAGE due probably to the presence of N-linked glycan. The three strains were lethal to ICR mice by intracerebral (IC) inoculation, but when inoculated intraperitoneally (IP), WNV caused viremia, invaded the CNS and was lethal, whereas the attenuates showed no viremia or invasion of the CNS. The attenuates elicited antibodies to comparable levels as WNV in IP-infected mice, conferring upon them immunity to IC challenge with the wild type. In IP-inoculated SCID mice the three strains exhibited similar high viremiae that lasted until death of the animals. All strains invaded the CNS and proliferated in the mouse brain to similar high titers, but differed largely in the time of invasion: WNV invaded the CNS of SCID mice (and two other mouse strains) much earlier than the attenuates, which showed large intervals in their time of invasion into individual mouse brains within the group. The data presented for SCID mice indicate that WN25 and WN25A have truly lost the neuroinvasive property, and that this property materialized by a prescribed, active process specific for WNV."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	8930665	Flavivirus-induced up-regulation of MHC class I antigens; implications for the induction of CD8+ T-cell-mediated autoimmunity.	"Infection of a wide variety of cells of human, mouse and other species' origin by flaviviruses such as WNV, YF, Den, MVE, KUN and JE, increases the cell-surface expression of MHC class I. This MHC class I up-regulation is not due to increased MHC class I synthesis per se, but the result of increased peptide availability in the ER for MHC class I assembly. This is most likely due to the interaction of the viral polyprotein with the ER membrane during viral replication. Flavivirus infection can overcome peptide deficiency in TAP-deficient or non-permissive cell lines such as RMA-S and Syrian hamster cells, BHK and NIL-2. The consequence of this increased MHC class I expression manifests itself in reduced susceptibility to NK cells and augmented lysis by Tc cells. In mice, long-term flavivirus-immune Tc cell memory formation is impaired, following the appearance of strong anti-self Tc cell reactivity observed in in vitro cultures from splenocytes of flavivirus-primed animals. We hypothesize that flavivirus-induced MHC class I up-regulation leads to transient T-cell autoimmunity, followed by down-regulation of both autoimmunity and virus-specific Tc cell memory. Furthermore, we speculate that flavivirus infections of humans in the tropics may be responsible for the observed lower incidence of overt autoimmunity in these geographic regions than in temperate climates where flaviviruses are not endemic."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	11287553	West Nile virus recombinant DNA vaccine protects mouse and horse from virus challenge and expresses in vitro a noninfectious recombinant antigen that can be used in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.	"Introduction of West Nile (WN) virus into the United States in 1999 created major human and animal health concerns. Currently, no human or veterinary vaccine is available to prevent WN viral infection, and mosquito control is the only practical strategy to combat the spread of disease. Starting with a previously designed eukaryotic expression vector, we constructed a recombinant plasmid (pCBWN) that expressed the WN virus prM and E proteins. A single intramuscular injection of pCBWN DNA induced protective immunity, preventing WN virus infection in mice and horses. Recombinant plasmid-transformed COS-1 cells expressed and secreted high levels of WN virus prM and E proteins into the culture medium. The medium was treated with polyethylene glycol to concentrate proteins. The resultant, containing high-titered recombinant WN virus antigen, proved to be an excellent alternative to the more traditional suckling-mouse brain WN virus antigen used in the immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody-capture and indirect IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. This recombinant antigen has great potential to become the antigen of choice and will facilitate the standardization of reagents and implementation of WN virus surveillance in the United States and elsewhere."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	12186974	A nonsense mutation in the gene encoding 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase/L1 isoform is associated with West Nile virus susceptibility in laboratory mice.	"A mouse model has been established to investigate the genetic determinism of host susceptibility to West Nile (WN) virus, a member of the genus flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. Whereas WN virus causes encephalitis and death in most laboratory inbred mouse strains after peripheral inoculation, most strains derived from recently trapped wild mice are completely resistant. The phenotype of resistance/susceptibility is determined by a major locus, Wnv, mapping to chromosome 5 within the 0.4-cM-wide interval defined by markers D5Mit408 and D5Mit242. We constructed a high resolution composite/consensus map of the interval by merging the data from the mouse T31 Radiation Hybrid map and those from the homologous region of human chromosome 12q, and found the cluster of genes encoding 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (2'-5'-OAS) to be the most prominent candidate. This cluster encodes a multimember family of IFN-inducible proteins that is known to play an important role in the established endogenous antiviral pathway. Comparing the cDNA sequences of 2'-5'-OAS L1, L2, and L3 isoforms, between susceptible and resistant strains, we identified a STOP codon in exon 4 of the gene encoding the L1 isoform in susceptible strains that can lead to a truncated form with amputation of one domain, whereas all resistant mice tested so far have a normal copy of this gene. The observation that WN virus sensitivity of susceptible mice was completely correlated with the occurrence of a point mutation in 2'-5'-OAS L1 suggests that this isoform may play a critical role in WN pathogenesis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	14645550	Antibody prophylaxis and therapy against West Nile virus infection in wild-type and immunodeficient mice.	"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus that causes encephalitis in a subset of susceptible humans. Current treatment for WNV infections is supportive, and no specific therapy or vaccine is available. In this study, we directly tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of polyclonal antibodies against WNV. Passive administration of human gamma globulin or mouse serum prior to WNV infection protected congenic wild-type, B-cell-deficient ( micro MT), and T- and B-cell-deficient (RAG1) C57BL/6J mice. Notably, no increased mortality due to immune enhancement was observed. Although immune antibody completely prevented morbidity and mortality in wild-type mice, its effect was not durable in immunocompromised mice: many micro MT and RAG1 mice eventually succumbed to infection. Thus, antibody by itself did not completely eliminate viral reservoirs in host tissues, consistent with an intact cellular immune response being required for viral clearance. In therapeutic postexposure studies, human gamma globulin partially protected against WNV-induced mortality. In micro MT mice, therapy had to be initiated within 2 days of infection to gain a survival benefit, whereas in the wild-type mice, therapy even 5 days after infection reduced mortality. This time point is significant because between days 4 and 5, WNV was detected in the brains of infected mice. Thus, passive transfer of immune antibody improves clinical outcome even after WNV has disseminated into the central nervous system."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	15185728	Effect of interferon-alpha and interferon-inducers on West Nile virus in mouse and hamster animal models.	"The recent West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in the United States has increased the need to identify effective therapies. Studies were conducted in cell culture and in rodent animal models to determine the efficacy of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon (IFN) inducers and ribavirin, alone or in combination with IFN, in treating WNV. Intraperitoneal injection of IFN-alpha B/D (qd for 7 days), polyI-polyC(12)U [Ampligen (every other day for 7 days)] and topically applied imiquimod (qd for 7 days), administered from 1 day before viral challenge, were effective in protecting, respectively, 100%, 100% and 70% of BALB/c mice from mortality induced by subcutaneous injection of WNV. When IFN-alpha B/D or Ampligen treatments were delayed to 4-6 h before viral challenge in mice, efficacy was greatly diminished. Infected Syrian golden hamsters treated with interferon alphacon-1 (Infergen) and Ampligen 4-6 h before viral challenge gained more weight and had a greater survival than saline-treated animals. A combination study of subcutaneously administered Infergen (5 to 0.05 microg/kg/day) and ribavirin (75 to 7.5 mg/kg/day) in >7 week old hamsters demonstrated that Infergen was slightly efficacious in reducing mortality and disease signs; however, it was not synergistic in its antiviral effects when combined with ribavirin. Ribavirin treatment alone increased mortality of infected hamsters. The reduced mortality correlated with reduced plasma viraemia. Since WNV-infected patients have already been treated with IFN and ribavirin and future clinical trials have been suggested, this first report of IFN alone or in combination with ribavirin in WNV-infected animal models might provide useful information for subsequent treatment of patients."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	15956579	Envelope protein glycosylation status influences mouse neuroinvasion phenotype of genetic lineage 1 West Nile virus strains.	"The introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) into North America has been associated with relatively high rates of neurological disease and death in humans, birds, horses, and some other animals. Previous studies identified strains in both genetic lineage 1 and genetic lineage 2, including North American isolates of lineage 1, that were highly virulent in a mouse neuroinvasion model, while other strains were avirulent or significantly attenuated (D. W. C. Beasley, L. Li, M. T. Suderman, and A. D. T. Barrett, Virology 296:17-23, 2002). To begin to elucidate the basis for these differences, we compared a highly virulent New York 1999 (NY99) isolate with a related Old World lineage 1 strain, An4766 (ETH76a), which is attenuated for mouse neuroinvasion. Genomic sequencing of ETH76a revealed a relatively small number of nucleotide (5.1%) and amino acid (0.6%) differences compared with NY99. These differences were located throughout the genome and included five amino acid differences in the envelope protein gene. Substitution of premembrane and envelope genes of ETH76a into a NY99 infectious clone backbone yielded a virus with altered in vitro growth characteristics and a mouse virulence phenotype comparable to ETH76a. Further site-specific mutagenesis studies revealed that the altered phenotype was primarily mediated via loss of envelope protein glycosylation and that this was associated with altered stability of the virion at mildly acidic pH. Therefore, the enhanced virulence of North American WNV strains compared with other Old World lineage 1 strains is at least partly mediated by envelope protein glycosylation."	0

"Following the isolation in 1997 of West Nile virus from the brains of geese with an acute neuroparalytic disease in Israel, which reappeared in the following years, an inactivated vaccine was prepared from suckling mouse brains. The brain homogenate was inactivated with formaldehyde and blended with mineral oil adjuvant. In 2000, the first flocks were vaccinated according to a schedule of two subcutaneous doses, commencing at the age of 2 weeks and given with a 2-weeks interval. In efficacy trials, the challenge virus was injected at 7 weeks by the intracranial route, and over 85% protection was recorded in vaccinated geese. In extensive field trials conducted in 2001--2003, the vaccine was demonstrated to be safe and efficacious, and over 3 million doses were manufactured in 2000--2003."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	17038696	West Nile virus infection of primary mouse neuronal and neuroglial cells: the role of astrocytes in chronic infection.	"Primary cultures of embryonic murine neurons and newborn mouse astrocytes were inoculated with West Nile virus (WNV) strain NY385-99 to compare the pathogenesis of WNV infection in these types of CNS cells. Two different outcomes were observed. WNV infection in the neurons was rapidly progressive and destructive; within 5 days, all of the neurons were destroyed through apoptosis. WNV infection in the astrocytes evolved more slowly and did not seem to be highly lethal to the cells. The infected astrocytes continued to produce infectious virus (10(4.6)-10(6.5) PFU/mL) for 114 days, in a permissive, persistent infection. During this period, WNV antigen could be shown in the cytoplasm of the infected astrocytes by immunocytochemical assay, transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections, and in the cell culture medium by complement fixation test. Our results with this in vitro experimental murine cell model indicate that astrocytes can develop chronic or persistent infection with WNV, suggesting that these cells may play a role in the maintenance of WNV in the CNS."	0

mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	17485503	In vitro resistance selection and in vivo efficacy of morpholino oligomers against West Nile virus.	"We characterize in vitro resistance to and demonstrate the in vivo efficacy of two antisense phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs) against West Nile virus (WNV). Both PMOs were conjugated with an Arg-rich peptide. One peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) binds to the 5' terminus of the viral genome (5'-end PPMO); the other targets an essential 3' RNA element required for genome cyclization (3' conserved sequence I [3' CSI] PPMO). The 3' CSI PPMO displayed a broad spectrum of antiflavivirus activity, suppressing WNV, Japanese encephalitis virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus, as demonstrated by reductions in viral titers of 3 to 5 logs in cell cultures, likely due to the absolute conservation of the 3' CSI PPMO-targeted sequences among these viruses. The selection and sequencing of PPMO-resistant WNV showed that the 5'-end-PPMO-resistant viruses contained two to three mismatches within the PPMO-binding site whereas the 3' CSI PPMO-resistant viruses accumulated mutations outside the PPMO-targeted region. The mutagenesis of a WNV infectious clone demonstrated that the mismatches within the PPMO-binding site were responsible for the 5'-end PPMO resistance. In contrast, a U insertion or a G deletion located within the 3'-terminal stem-loop of the viral genome was the determinant of the 3' CSI PPMO resistance. In a mouse model, both the 5'-end and 3' CSI PPMOs (administered at 100 or 200 microg/day) partially protected mice from WNV disease, with minimal to no PPMO-mediated toxicity. A higher treatment dose (300 microg/day) caused toxicity. Unconjugated PMOs (3 mg/day) showed neither efficacy nor toxicity, suggesting the importance of the peptide conjugate for efficacy. The results suggest that a modification of the peptide conjugate composition to reduce its toxicity yet maintain its ability to effectively deliver PMO into cells may improve PMO-mediated therapy."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	17675128	Tissue tropism and neuroinvasion of West Nile virus do not differ for two mouse strains with different survival rates.	"West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that infects the central nervous system of humans and other animals. In this study, we found that C3H/HeN (C3H) mice exhibited a higher morbidity and mortality than C57BL/6 (B6) mice. We compared tissue tropism, viral replication and kinetics for C3H and B6 mice during acute viral infection. WNV was detected in multiple tissues, including novel sites such as the skin, duodenum and pancreas, but the tropism was identical for the two strains. Additionally, viral load and kinetics of spread did not differ substantially between strains. Neuroinvasion occurred in both strains by day 3 post-inoculation with early detection in the olfactory bulbs and spinal cord, suggesting that WNV neuroinvades at specific sites. Furthermore, neuroinvasion and viral load in the CNS did not predict disease outcome. Our data suggest that the disparities in morbidity and mortality between C3H and B6 mice are not due to differences in tropism, viral load or kinetics during acute WNV infection."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	17715236	Induction of epitope-specific neutralizing antibodies against West Nile virus.	"Previous studies have established that an epitope on the lateral ridge of domain III (DIII-lr) of West Nile virus (WNV) envelope (E) protein is recognized by strongly neutralizing type-specific antibodies. In contrast, an epitope against the fusion loop in domain II (DII-fl) is recognized by flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies with less neutralizing potential. Using gain- and loss-of-function E proteins and wild-type and variant WNV reporter virus particles, we evaluated the expression pattern and activity of antibodies against the DIII-lr and DII-fl epitopes in mouse and human serum after WNV infection. In mice, immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies to the DIII-lr epitope were detected at low levels at day 6 after infection. However, compared to IgG responses against other epitopes in DI and DII, which were readily detected at day 8, the development of IgG against DIII-lr epitope was delayed and did not appear consistently until day 15. This late time point is notable since almost all death after WNV infection in mice occurs by day 12. Nonetheless, at later time points, DIII-lr antibodies accumulated and comprised a significant fraction of the DIII-specific IgG response. In sera from infected humans, DIII-lr antibodies were detected at low levels and did not correlate with clinical outcome. In contrast, antibodies to the DII-fl were detected in all human serum samples and encompassed a significant percentage of the anti-E protein response. Our experiments suggest that the highly neutralizing DIII-lr IgG antibodies have little significant role in primary infection and that the antibody response of humans may be skewed toward the induction of cross-reactive, less-neutralizing antibodies."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	17804507	Differential expression of interferon (IFN) regulatory factors and IFN-stimulated genes at early times after West Nile virus infection of mouse embryo fibroblasts.	"Although lineage I West Nile virus (WNV) strain Eg101 induced beta interferon (IFN-beta) production as early as 12 h after infection in primary mouse embryo fibroblasts and did not inhibit the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, it was still able to replicate efficiently. To gain insights about possible viral countermeasures used by this virus to suppress the host response, the cell transcriptional profile and the kinetics of IFN regulatory factor (IRF) expression and activation were examined at early times after infection. By 12 h after WNV infection, the majority of the up-regulated genes were ones involved in IFN pathways. However, comparison of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) expression levels in mock-infected, IFN-treated, and virus-infected cells indicated that WNV infection suppressed the up-regulation of a subset of ISGs, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, and stress responses, prior to 24 h after infection. Analysis of mRNA and protein levels for representative genes indicated that suppression was at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Translocation of IRF-3 to the nucleus was observed beginning at 8 h, IRF-7 expression was detected by 12 h, but IRF-1 expression was not detected until 24 h after infection. Virus-induced gene suppression was sufficient to overcome the effect of exogenous IFN pretreatment for 1 h but not for 4 h prior to infection. These data indicate that WNV can selectively counteract the host response at early times after infection by previously unreported mechanisms."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	18727488	Innate resistance to flavivirus infections and the functions of 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases.	"Mouse susceptibility to experimental infections with flaviviruses is significantly influenced by a cluster of genes on chromosome 5 encoding a family of proteins with enzymatic properties, the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS). Positional cloning of the locus in question has revealed that susceptibility of laboratory inbred strains to this class of virus is associated with a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the OAS1B isoform. Analysis of the molecular structure of the cluster in different mammalian species including human indicates that the cluster is extremely polymorphic with a highly variable number of genes and pseudogenes whose functions are not yet completely established. Although still preliminary, a few recent observations also substantiate a possible role for OAS1 in human susceptibility to viral infections (West Nile virus, SARS, etc.) and its possible involvement in some other diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Finally, convergent observations indicate that the molecules encoded by the 2 '-5' OAS cluster might be involved in other fundamental cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation, gene regulation, and apoptosis."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	18768985	Mutation of mapped TIA-1/TIAR binding sites in the 3' terminal stem-loop of West Nile virus minus-strand RNA in an infectious clone negatively affects genomic RNA amplification.	"Previous data showed that the cellular proteins TIA-1 and TIAR bound specifically to the West Nile virus 3' minus-strand stem-loop [WNV3'(-)SL] RNA (37) and colocalized with flavivirus replication complexes in WNV- and dengue virus-infected cells (21). In the present study, the sites on the WNV3'(-)SL RNA required for efficient in vitro T-cell intracellular antigen-related (TIAR) and T-cell intracellular antigen-1 (TIA-1) protein binding were mapped to short AU sequences (UAAUU) located in two internal loops of the WNV3'(-)SL RNA structure. Infectious clone RNAs with all or most of the binding site nucleotides in one of the 3' (-)SL loops deleted or substituted did not produce detectable virus after transfection or subsequent passage. With one exception, deletion/mutation of a single terminal nucleotide in one of the binding sequences had little effect on the efficiency of protein binding or virus production, but mutation of a nucleotide in the middle of a binding sequence reduced both the in vitro protein binding efficiency and virus production. Plaque size, intracellular genomic RNA levels, and virus production progressively decreased with decreasing in vitro TIAR/TIA-1 binding activity, but the translation efficiency of the various mutant RNAs was similar to that of the parental RNA. Several of the mutant RNAs that inefficiently interacted with TIAR/TIA-1 in vitro rapidly reverted in vivo, indicating that they could replicate at a low level and suggesting that an interaction between TIAR/TIA-1 and the viral 3'(-)SL RNA is not required for initial low-level symmetric RNA replication but instead facilitates the subsequent asymmetric amplification of genome RNA from the minus-strand template."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	19109382	Live chimeric and inactivated Japanese encephalitis virus vaccines differ in their cross-protective values against Murray Valley encephalitis virus.	"The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) serocomplex, which also includes Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV), is a group of antigenically closely related, mosquito-borne flaviviruses that are responsible for severe encephalitic disease in humans. While vaccines against the prominent members of this serocomplex are available or under development, it is unlikely that they will be produced specifically against those viruses which cause less-frequent disease, such as MVEV. Here we have evaluated the cross-protective values of an inactivated JEV vaccine (JE-VAX) and a live chimeric JEV vaccine (ChimeriVax-JE) against MVEV in two mouse models of flaviviral encephalitis. We show that (i) a three-dose vaccination schedule with JE-VAX provides cross-protective immunity, albeit only partial in the more severe challenge model; (ii) a single dose of ChimeriVax-JE gives complete protection in both challenge models; (iii) the cross-protective immunity elicited with ChimeriVax-JE is durable (>or=5 months) and broad (also giving protection against West Nile virus); (iv) humoral and cellular immunities elicited with ChimeriVax-JE contribute to protection against lethal challenge with MVEV; (v) ChimeriVax-JE remains fully attenuated in immunodeficient mice lacking type I and type II interferon responses; and (vi) immunization with JE-VAX, but not ChimeriVax-JE, can prime heterologous infection enhancement in recipients of vaccination on a low-dose schedule, designed to mimic vaccine failure or waning of vaccine-induced immunity. Our results suggest that the live chimeric JEV vaccine will protect against other viruses belonging to the JEV serocomplex, consistent with the observation of cross-protection following live virus infections."	0

We have previously reported that RepliVAX WN is a safe and efficacious vaccine in mouse and hamster models of WN disease. Here, we report that vaccination of hamsters with RepliVAX WN induces antibody responses that remain stable for at least 6 months. Furthermore, animals challenged with virulent WNV 6 months after vaccination were protected from disease as well as those challenged 2 months post-vaccination, with no vaccinated animals succumbing to WNV challenge. These results indicate that RepliVAX is capable of inducing durable protective immunity after a single dose."	0

Prior studies with West Nile virus (WNV) identified therapeutic mouse and human monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognized epitopes on domain III (DIII) of the E protein. To identify an analogous panel of neutralizing antibodies against DENV type-1 (DENV-1), we immunized mice with a genotype 2 strain of DENV-1 virus and generated 79 new MAbs, 16 of which strongly inhibited infection by the homologous virus and localized to DIII. Surprisingly, only two MAbs, DENV1-E105 and DENV1-E106, retained strong binding and neutralizing activity against all five DENV-1 genotypes. In an immunocompromised mouse model of infection, DENV1-E105 and DENV1-E106 exhibited therapeutic activity even when administered as a single dose four days after inoculation with a heterologous genotype 4 strain of DENV-1. Using epitope mapping and X-ray crystallographic analyses, we localized the neutralizing determinants for the strongly inhibitory MAbs to distinct regions on DIII. Interestingly, sequence variation in DIII alone failed to explain disparities in neutralizing potential of MAbs among different genotypes. Overall, our experiments define a complex structural epitope on DIII of DENV-1 that can be recognized by protective antibodies with therapeutic potential."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	20516277	Inhibition of dengue virus by an ester prodrug of an adenosine analog.	"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent mosquito-borne viral pathogen that infects humans. Neither a vaccine nor an antiviral therapy is currently available for DENV. Here, we report an adenosine nucleoside prodrug that potently inhibits DENV replication both in cell culture and in a DENV mouse model. NITD449 (2'-C-acetylene-7-deaza-7-carbamoyladenosine) was initially identified as a parental compound that inhibits all four serotypes of DENV with low cytotoxicity. However, in vivo pharmacokinetic studies indicated that NITD449 had a low level of exposure in plasma when dosed orally. To increase the oral bioavailability, we covalently linked isobutyric acids to the 3'- and 5'-hydroxyl groups of ribose via ester linkage to NITD449, leading to the prodrug NITD203 (3',5'-O-diisobutyryl-2'-C-acetylene-7-deaza-7-carbamoyl-adenosin). Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that upon oral dosing of the prodrug, NITD203 was readily converted to NITD449, resulting in improved exposure of the parental compound in plasma in both mouse and rat. In DENV-infected AG129 mice, oral dosing of the prodrug at 25 mg/kg of body weight reduced peak viremia by 30-fold. Antiviral spectrum analysis showed that NITD203 inhibited various flaviviruses (DENV, yellow fever virus, and West Nile virus) and hepatitis C virus but not Chikungunya virus (an alphavirus). Mode-of-action analysis, using a luciferase-reporting replicon, indicated that NITD203 inhibited DENV RNA synthesis. Although NITD203 exhibited potent in vitro and in vivo efficacies, the compound could not reach a satisfactory no-observable-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in a 2-week in vivo toxicity study. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that a prodrug approach using a nucleoside analog could potentially be developed for flavivirus antiviral therapy."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	20551474	Flavivirus encephalitis: pathological aspects of mouse and other animal models.	"Encephalitic flaviviruses are important arthropod-borne pathogens of humans and other animals. In particular, the recent emergence of the West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in new geographic areas has caused a considerable public health alert and international concern. Among the experimental in vivo models of WNV and JEV infection, mice and other laboratory rodents are the most thoroughly studied and well-characterized systems, having provided data that are important for understanding the infectious process in humans. Macaca monkeys have also been used as a model for WNV and JEV infection, mainly for the evaluation of vaccine efficacy, although a limited number of published studies have addressed pathomorphology. These animal models demonstrate the development of encephalitis with many similarities to the human disease; however, the histological events that occur during infection, especially in peripheral tissues, have not been fully characterized."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	20579746	TNF-alpha-dependent regulation of CXCR3 expression modulates neuronal survival during West Nile virus encephalitis.	"The chemokine CXCL10 exerts antiviral effects within the central nervous system (CNS) through the recruitment of virus-specific T cells. However, elevated levels of CXCL10 may induce neuronal apoptosis given its receptor, CXCR3, is expressed by neurons. Using a murine model of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis, we determined that WNV-infected neurons express TNF-alpha, which down-regulates neuronal CXCR3 expression via signaling through TNFR1. Down-regulation of neuronal CXCR3 decreased CXCL10-mediated calcium transients and delayed Caspase 3 activation. Loss of CXCR3 activation, via CXCR3-deficiency or pretreatment with TNF-alpha prevented neuronal apoptosis during in vitro WNV infection. These results suggest that neuronal TNF-alpha expression during WNV encephalitis may be an adaptive response to diminish CXCL10-induced death."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	20818395	Caspase-12 controls West Nile virus infection via the viral RNA receptor RIG-I.	"Caspase-12 has been shown to negatively modulate inflammasome signaling during bacterial infection. Its function in viral immunity, however, has not been characterized. We now report an important role for caspase-12 in controlling viral infection via the pattern-recognition receptor RIG-I. After challenge with West Nile virus (WNV), caspase-12-deficient mice had greater mortality, higher viral burden and defective type I interferon response compared with those of challenged wild-type mice. In vitro studies of primary neurons and mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed that caspase-12 positively modulated the production of type I interferon by regulating E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I, a critical signaling event for the type I interferon response to WNV and other important viral pathogens."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	20854017	Transcriptional upregulation of SOCS 1 and suppressors of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA in the absence of suppressors of cytokine signaling 2 mRNA after infection with West Nile virus or tick-borne encephalitis virus.	"Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins are a family of proteins that are able to act in a classic negative feedback loop to regulate cytokine signal transduction. The regulation of the immune response by SOCS proteins may contribute to persistent infection or even a fatal outcome. In this study, we have investigated the induction of SOCS 1-3 after peripheral infection with West Nile virus (WNV) or tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) in the murine model. We have shown that the cytokine response after infection of mice with WNV or TBEV induces an upregulation in the brain of mRNA transcripts for SOCS 1 and SOCS 3, but not SOCS 2. We hypothesize that SOCS proteins may play a role in limiting cytokine responses in the brain as a neuroprotective mechanism, which may actually enhance the ability of neuroinvasive viruses such as WNV and TBEV to spread and cause disease."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	21178115	Nitric oxide controls an inflammatory-like Ly6C(hi)PDCA1+ DC subset that regulates Th1 immune responses.	"Using NOS2 KO mice, we investigated the hypothesis that NO modulation of BM-DC contributes to the NO-mediated control of Th1 immune responses. BM-DCs from NOS2 KO mice, compared with WT BM-DCs, have enhanced survival and responsiveness to TLR agonists, develop more Ly6C(hi)PDCA1(+) DCs that resemble inflammatory DCs and produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines. Also, compared with WT-infected mice, NOS2 KO mice infected with WNV showed enhanced expansion of a similar inflammatory Ly6C(hi)PDCA1(+) DC subset. Furthermore, in contrast to WT DCs, OVA-loaded NOS2 KO BM-DCs promoted increased IFN-γ production by OTII CD4(+) T cells in vitro and when adoptively transferred in vivo. The addition of a NO donor to NOS2 KO BM-DCs prior to OTII T cells priming in vivo was sufficient to revert Th1 immune responses to levels induced by WT BM-DCs. Thus, autocrine NO effects on maturation of inflammatory DCs and on DC programming of T cells may contribute to the protective role of NO in autoimmune diseases and infections. Regulating NO levels may be a useful tool to shape beneficial immune responses for DC-based immunotherapy."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	21541326	A recombinant influenza A virus expressing domain III of West Nile virus induces protective immune responses against influenza and West Nile virus.	"West Nile virus (WNV) continues to circulate in the USA and forms a threat to the rest of the Western hemisphere. Since methods for the treatment of WNV infections are not available, there is a need for the development of safe and effective vaccines. Here, we describe the construction of a recombinant influenza virus expressing domain III of the WNV glycoprotein E (Flu-NA-DIII) and its evaluation as a WNV vaccine candidate in a mouse model. FLU-NA-DIII-vaccinated mice were protected from severe body weight loss and mortality caused by WNV infection, whereas control mice succumbed to the infection. In addition, it was shown that one subcutaneous immunization with 10(5) TCID(50) Flu-NA-DIII provided 100% protection against challenge. Adoptive transfer experiments demonstrated that protection was mediated by antibodies and CD4+T cells. Furthermore, mice vaccinated with FLU-NA-DIII developed protective influenza virus-specific antibody titers. It was concluded that this vector system might be an attractive platform for the development of bivalent WNV-influenza vaccines."	0
mus musculus	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1
mus musculus	Rodentia	western equine encephalitis virus	4426699	Experimental infection with western equine encephalomyelitis virus in wild rodents indigenous to Kern County, California.	"Six species of rodents from Kern County, California, were inoculated subcutaneously with western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus to determine their susceptibility to infection and their potential as natural hosts. Ammospermophilus nelsoni, Citellus beecheyi, Dipodomys heermanni, Dipodomys nitratoides, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Sciurus griseus were readily infected. Infection was usually fatal in Dipodomys species, C. beecheyi, and S. griseus, but was clinically inapparent in other species. Viremic responses varied greatly in magnitude and duration in different species and with different viral strains. Viremic animals that survived developed high titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody. Hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies persisted at high titers for at least 8 to 58 weeks after infection, except in P. maniculatus. If animals died during or shortly after the viremic phase of infection, the virus usually was recoverable from numerous organs. Long-term survival of virus could not be demonstrated in A. nelsoni and Dipodomys species. It is concluded that A. nelsoni and P. maniculatus are not important natural hosts of WEE virus; they are susceptible to infection and develop antibodies, but serological surveys of the same species rarely reveal evidence of infection. S. griseus, D. heermanni, D. nitratoides, and possibly C. beecheyi are aberrant hosts of WEE virus since most of them died when infected. Two species of ticks that are ectoparasitic on rodents in Kern County were evaluated as vectors of WEE virus. Dermacentor parumapertus failed to become infected after feeding on viremic hosts, and Ornithodorus parkeri became infected but failed to transmit virus."	0
myodes gapperi	Rodentia	parechovirus b	6801	Characterization of Whitney's Clethrionomy gapperi virus isolates from Massachusetts.	"Six strains of virus were recovered from the blood and/or liver of five Clethrionomys gapperi ochraceus trapped in southeastern Massachusetts during 1969. Biological, antigenic and physiochemical properties of these isolates are reported. USA M-2268a was selected as the reference strain. This strain was identical by complement-fixation and neutralization tests to Whitneys C. gapperie virus (USA 64-7855) from New York State and was related to, but distinct from, an unpublished agent (Johnson's Microtus montanus enterovirus USA M-1146) isolated in June, 1962 from voles trapped in Klamath County, Oregon. USA M-2268a was resistant to lipid solvents and acid pH and was stable at temperatures of 4 C, 22 C, and 37 C. Virus was detected over a 10-day observation period in four species of mosquitoes inoculated with USA M-2268a, although there was no evidence of infection or replication, and transmission attempts by bite failed. Neutralizing antibody was detected in C.g. gapperi and C. g. ochraceus in various habitats throughout the state."	0
myodes glareolus	Rodentia	equine torovirus	6506447	Antibodies to Berne virus in horses and other animals.	"After inoculation into 2 foals, Berne virus induced neutralizing antibody, but did not cause clinical symptoms. In a horizontal study of seropositive mares and their offspring, a decline of maternal antibodies and a sudden synchronous seroconversion in all foals were observed, again without clinical symptoms. The virus is widespread in the Swiss horse population and has been so during the last decade; rises in antibody titers were noted in 9% of paired sera sampled at random. Positive reactions were also obtained in serum neutralization tests and ELISA using small numbers of horse sera from Germany, France and the U.S.A. The results of neutralization tests and ELISA were correlated in 83% of random samples tested; 13% were neutralization-positive and ELISA-negative and in 4% the inverse was observed. Neutralizing activity was found in the sera of other ungulates (cattle, goat, sheep and pig), laboratory rabbits and 2 species of wild mice (Clethrionomys glareolus and Apodemus sylvaticus). Inconclusive results were obtained with feline and human sera; those from dogs and foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were consistently negative. The probable occurrence of antigenic variants in Berne-type viruses is discussed."	0
myodes glareolus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	23818848	Evidence for novel hepaciviruses in rodents.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the most relevant causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%). Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV. "	0

Isolation and propagation of nephropathia epidemica virus in bank voles Scandinavian Journal of Infectious Diseases 16:225-228.	"Three strains of nephropathia epidemica (NE) virus were isolated from lung tissues of bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) and a grey-sided vole (C. rufocanus) trapped in Västerbotten county, Sweden.

Experimentally infected animals developed a subclinical infection characterized by virus persistence, particularly in lung tissue. Attempts to infect other species of colonized rodents with NE virus and to isolate NE virus from acute phase patient blood were unsuccessful. The serial propagation of NE virus in colonized bank voles provides opportunities to study experimental infection in its reservoir rodent host."	0
myodes glareolus	Rodentia	puumala orthohantavirus	18680643	Puumala hantavirus excretion kinetics in bank voles (Myodes glareolus).	"Puumala hantavirus is present in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and is believed to be spread mainly by contaminated excretions. In this study, we subcutaneously inoculated 10 bank voles with Puumala virus and sampled excretions until day 133 postinfection. Levels of shed viral RNA peaked within 11-28, 14-21, and 11-28 days postinfection for saliva, urine, and feces, respectively. The latest detection of viral RNA was 84, 44, and 44 days postinfection in saliva, urine, and feces, respectively. In contrast, blood of 5 of 6 animals contained viral RNA at day 133 postinfection, suggesting that bank voles secrete virus only during a limited time of the infection. Intranasal inoculations with bank vole saliva, urine, or feces were all infectious for virus-negative bank voles, indicating that these 3 transmission routes may occur in nature and that rodent saliva might play a role in transmission to humans."	0
myodes glareolus	Rodentia	puumala orthohantavirus	20116854	Different cross-reactivity of human and rodent sera to Tula virus and Puumala virus.	"Tula virus (TULV) and Puumala virus (PUUV) are hantaviruses carried by the bank vole (Myodes glareolus) and European common vole (Microtus arvalis), respectively. PUUV is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), while TULV is thought to be apathogenic to humans. The N-terminal regions of the N proteins from TULV and PUUV were expressed and applied as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigens. Colonized Japanese grass voles (Microtus montebelli) and BALB/c mice were used for experimental inoculation of the vole-borne hantaviruses TULV and PUUV. Voles and mice showed significant antibody production toward both viruses, but these antisera showed little cross-reactivity between TULV and PUUV in the immunofluorescence antibody assay and ELISA. In contrast, sera from patients with HFRS caused by PUUV exhibited high cross-reactivity against the TULV antigen, and sera from a natural rodent reservoir showed moderate cross-reactivity against the heterologous antigen, indicating that the antigenic cross-reactivity between TULV and PUUV differs in sera from rodents and humans."	0
myodes glareolus	Rodentia	puumala orthohantavirus	21192975	An efficient in vivo method for the isolation of Puumala virus in Syrian hamsters and the characterization of the isolates from Russia.	"Puumala virus (PUUV) and other Arvicolinae-borne hantaviruses are difficult to cultivate in cell culture. To isolate these hantaviruses efficiently, hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (NP)-positive but seronegative wild rodents were selected by NP-detection ELISA. Three of 68 Myodes glareolus captured in Samara, Russia, were NP-positive and seronegative. Syrian hamsters were inoculated with lung homogenates from NP-positive rodents for virus propagation. Virus isolation in vitro was carried out by inoculation of lung homogenates of NP-positive hamsters to Vero E6 cell monolayers. Two PUUV strains (Samara49/CG/2005 and Samara94/CG/2005) from M. glareolus were isolated in Vero E6 cells. Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of the S segment of these isolates to those of PUUV F-s808 from a fatal HFRS patient in Samara region were 96.7-99.3% and 99.3-100.0%, respectively. Morphologic features of Vero E6 cells infected with PUUV strain Samara49/CG/2005 were quite similar to those of Hantaan virus-infected cells. Isolation of Hokkaido virus from Myodes rufocanus captured in Hokkaido, Japan, was also performed. Hokkaido virus NP and RNA were recovered and maintained in hamsters. These results suggest that inoculation of Syrian hamsters with rodent samples is an efficient method for the isolation and maintenance of PUUV and other Arvicolinae-borne hantaviruses."	0

"European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1, genotype 5) is known to endemically circulate in insectivorous bat populations in Germany. In August 2001, a rabies suspect stone marten (Martes foina) was found in the city of Burg (Saxony-Anhalt, Germany) and was sent to the regional veterinary laboratory for routine rabies diagnosis.

myotis riparius	Chiroptera	rabies lyssavirus	21503551	First report of rabies infection in bats, Molossus molossus, Molossops neglectus and Myotis riparius in the city of São Paulo, State of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil.	"This paper presents the first report of rabies in three bat species, Molossus molossus, Molossops neglectus and Myotis riparius in the city of São Paulo, Brazil., Bats were diagnosed as positive for rabies using the fluorescent antibody test and mouse inoculation test. The isolates were characterized antigenically using a panel of eight monoclonal antibodies. The samples were also genetically analyzed by partial sequencing of the portion of nucleoprotein gene between positions 1157 and 1445 nt., Analysis of the results verified that the sample isolated from the species M. molossus presented antigenic variant 6, while the other two samples showed a different profile from that established in the panel, one not previously reported in the literature. The results of genetic analysis revealed that the M. molossus sample segregated with Lasiurus sp. isolates, M. neglectus segregated with a subgroup of Eptesicus furinalis isolates and the Myotis riparius sample segregated with Myotis sp. isolates., The cases reported in this paper emphasize the need for clarification of the circumstances in which cases of rabies in wildlife occur, principally in urban areas."	0

Experimental infection of Neotoma albigula (Muridae) with Whitewater Arroyo virus (Arenaviridae). Am J Trop Med Hyg 65:147-151.	"The Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWA) is a newly described North American arenavirus. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the biology of this virus in its natural rodent host, Neotoma albigula (white-throated woodrat). Thirteen adult, 7 juvenile, and 8 newborn woodrats each were inoculated subcutaneously with 1,000 cell culture infectious dose50 of the WWA virus prototype strain AV 9310135. All 28 animals became infected (as measured by the recovery of infectious virus and/or seroconversion) and no overt illness was associated with infection. Infection and virus shedding in the adult animals were transient (less than 59 days) whereas virus shedding in animals inoculated at birth persisted through 164 days of age. These results indicate that the duration of WWA virus infection in N. albigula is dependent upon the animal's age at the onset of infection and that neonatal infection can result in chronic (perhaps lifelong) virus shedding."	0

Both EBLV-1 isolates share a 99.5% identity. This is the first report of an EBLV-1a spill-over from an insectivorous bat into wildlife in Europe."	0
nyctalus noctula	Chiroptera	rabies lyssavirus	1683127	New strains of rabies-related viruses isolated from bats in the Ukraine.	"Two strains (UB-1 and UB-2) of rabies-related viruses were isolated from the brain of Nyctalus noctula and Vespertilio murinus captured from the hollows of tall trees on the left bank of Pripyat river in the Volynsky region of Ukrainian S.S.R. The viruses were isolated by means of intracerebral inoculation to white mice. The isolates were identified as rabies-related viruses of Duvenhage type in an indirect test of fluorescent antibodies with the panels of nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies (NC Mab) provided by Wistar Institute (Philadelphia) and by Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL, Weybridge). During the typing with the Wistar panel of NC Mab complete antigenic similarity was established between the newly isolated strain and Yuli virus. The reaction with CVL NC Mab revealed group-specific antigenic similarity between Yuli virus on one hand, Duvenhage-6 and Duvenhage-66 on the other hand, as well as between UB-1 and UB-2 and Duvenhage-26. The reaction with antibodies to clones DB-3,4,6,9, and 10 detected antigenic similarity between the viruses of chiropteric origin isolated in the U.S.S.R., North-West Europe as well in Africa, although some differences were discovered. Yuli, UB-1, and UB-2 viruses isolated in the U.S.S.R. were proved to belong to Duvenhage group of viruses (serotype 4)."	0

Pathogenicity of different rabies virus isolates and protection test in vaccinated mice. Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo 52:231-236.	"This study was aimed to evaluate and compare the pathogenicity of rabies virus isolated from bats and dogs, and to verify the efficacy of a commercial rabies vaccine against these isolates. For evaluation of pathogenicity, mice were inoculated by the intramuscular route (IM) with 500MICLD₅₀/0.03 mL of the viruses. The cross-protection test was performed by vaccinating groups of mice by the subcutaneous route and challenged through the intracerebral (IC) route. Isolates were fully pathogenic when inoculated by the IC route. When inoculated intramuscularly, the pathogenicity observed showed different death rates: 60.0% for the Desmodus rotundus isolate; 50.0% for dog and Nyctinomops laticaudatus isolates; 40.0% for Artibeus lituratus isolate; 9.5% Molossus molossus isolate; and 5.2% for the Eptesicus furinalis isolate. Mice receiving two doses of the vaccine and challenged by the IC route with the isolates were fully protected. Mice receiving only one dose of vaccine were partially protected against the dog isolate. The isolates from bats were pathogenic by the IC route in mice. However, when inoculated through the intramuscular route, the same isolates were found with different degrees of pathogenicity. The results of this work suggest that a commercial vaccine protects mice from infection with bat rabies virus isolates, in addition to a canine rabies virus isolate."	0

oligoryzomys microtis	Rodentia	cricetid gammaherpesvirus 2	21209105	Identification and sequencing of a novel rodent gammaherpesvirus that establishes acute and latent infection in laboratory mice.	"Gammaherpesviruses encode numerous immunomodulatory molecules that contribute to their ability to evade the host immune response and establish persistent, lifelong infections. As the human gammaherpesviruses are strictly species specific, small animal models of gammaherpesvirus infection, such as murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68) infection, are important for studying the roles of gammaherpesvirus immune evasion genes in in vivo infection and pathogenesis. We report here the genome sequence and characterization of a novel rodent gammaherpesvirus, designated rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP), that shares conserved genes and genome organization with γHV68 and the primate gammaherpesviruses but is phylogenetically distinct from γHV68. RHVP establishes acute and latent infection in laboratory mice. Additionally, RHVP contains multiple open reading frames (ORFs) not present in γHV68 that have sequence similarity to primate gammaherpesvirus immunomodulatory genes or cellular genes. These include ORFs with similarity to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), C-type lectins, and the mouse mammary tumor virus and herpesvirus saimiri superantigens. As these ORFs may function as immunomodulatory or virulence factors, RHVP presents new opportunities for the study of mechanisms of immune evasion by gammaherpesviruses."	0

"In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, feces, etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity titrations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary Pekin duck embryo cells, and antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutralization tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five antigenic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, Tamana bat and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in mosquito cells in vitro."	0

Experimental Infection of Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) with West Nile Virus. American Journal of Tropical Medical Hygiene 2008 79:447-451.	"Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) have shown high West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence, and WNV infection has been suggested as a cause of morbidity and mortality in this species. We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean viremias of 10(5.1) and 10(4.8) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on days 3 and 4 post-infection (DPI) and estimated that approximately 2.1% of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1-5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities. The low viremias and lack of mortality observed in S. carolinensis suggest that they may be useful as sentinels of spillover from the enzootic amplification cycle."	0
peromyscus leucopus	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1
peromyscus maniculatus	Rodentia	fort morgan virus	7435797	Recovery of Tonate virus ('Bijou Bridge' strain), a member of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus complex, from Cliff Swallow nest bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) and nestling birds in North America.	"A second virus with distinct biological, serological, and physiochemical properties was detected as a minority viral subpopulation in specimens of Cliff Swallow nest bugs (Oeciacus vicarius) and nestling bird sera containing Fort Morgan (FM) virus. The second virus, detected by a breakthrough neutralization test employing FM antiserum, was present in 5 of 11 FM virus-positive pools of nest bugs and in 4 of 38 birds from Colorado and South Dakota. The concentration of the second virus was 10-fold to 1,000-fold lower than that of FM virus. The second virus, which was provisionally named \"Bijou Bridge\" (BB) virus was shown by conventional serological tests to be a member of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) complex, and by tests employing antisera to the E2 viral glycoprotein to be identical with Tonate virus, previously isolated from birds and mosquitoes only in French Guiana. Experimental infection of House Sparrows and Cliff Swallows showed that they develop brief BB viremias and antibodies. Oe. vicarius bugs were resistant to oral infection with BB virus. The epidemiological significance of recovery of Tonate virus in North American is discussed."	0
peromyscus maniculatus	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	23572554	Identification of rodent homologs of hepatitis C virus and pegiviruses.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV or GB virus C) are globally distributed and infect 2 to 5% of the human population. The lack of tractable-animal models for these viruses, in particular for HCV, has hampered the study of infection, transmission, virulence, immunity, and pathogenesis. To address this challenge, we searched for homologous viruses in small mammals, including wild rodents. Here we report the discovery of several new hepaciviruses (HCV-like viruses) and pegiviruses (GB virus-like viruses) that infect wild rodents. Complete genome sequences were acquired for a rodent hepacivirus (RHV) found in Peromyscus maniculatus and a rodent pegivirus (RPgV) found in Neotoma albigula. Unique genomic features and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these RHV and RPgV variants represent several novel virus species in the Hepacivirus and Pegivirus genera within the family Flaviviridae. The genetic diversity of the rodent hepaciviruses exceeded that observed for hepaciviruses infecting either humans or non-primates, leading to new insights into the origin, evolution, and host range of hepaciviruses. The presence of genes, encoded proteins, and translation elements homologous to those found in human hepaciviruses and pegiviruses suggests the potential for the development of new animal systems with which to model HCV pathogenesis, vaccine design, and treatment., The genetic and biological characterization of animal homologs of human viruses provides insights into the origins of human infections and enhances our ability to study their pathogenesis and explore preventive and therapeutic interventions. Horses are the only reported host of nonprimate homologs of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here, we report the discovery of HCV-like viruses in wild rodents. The majority of HCV-like viruses were found in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), a small rodent used in laboratories to study viruses, including hantaviruses. We also identified pegiviruses in rodents that are distinct from the pegiviruses found in primates, bats, and horses. These novel viruses may enable the development of small-animal models for HCV, the most common infectious cause of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatitis B virus, and help to explore the health relevance of the highly prevalent human pegiviruses."	0

"Regularities of endogenous interferon (IFN) induction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in rats and the effect of this process of the resistance of mast cells to the degranulating effect of immune complexes are described. Increased resistance of mast cells to the damaging effect of immune complexes for 72 hours after a single induction of endogenous IFN with virus was demonstrated in experiments in vivo. Inoculation of rats with NDV treated at pH = 2.0 did not induce the production of endogenous IFN, and the mast cells from these animals underwent degranulation to the same extent as those from intact animals. Protection of mast cells by IFN from the degranulating effect of immune complexes was also demonstrated in in vitro experiments."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2469283	Inhibited interferon production after space flight.	"Several studies have been performed in our laboratories indicating that interferon production may be impaired in rodents after space flight. Using an antiorthostatic suspension model that simulates some of the effects of microgravity seen during space flight, we have shown that interferon-alpha/beta production was inhibited. The inhibition was not due solely to the stress of suspension. The inhibited interferon production was transient, as suspended animals returned to normal caging recovered the ability to produce interferon. Antiorthostatic suspension of mice also resulted in a loss of resistance to infection with the diabetogenic strain of encephalomyocarditis virus, which correlated with the drop in interferon production. In rats flown in US Space Shuttle mission SL-3, interferon-gamma production was inhibited severely when spleen cells were challenged with concanavalin-A upon return to earth. In contrast, interleukin-3 production by these cells was normal. These results suggest that immune responses may be altered after antiorthostatic modeling or space flight, and the resistance to viral infections may be especially affected."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2560916	Sex-dependent, early cytokine production by NK-like spleen cells following infection with the D variant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV-D).	"Spleen cell cultures from diabetes-resistant ICR Swiss females exhibited an increase in expression of Ia antigens 24 hours post-infection (PI) with EMCV-D while comparable spleen cell cultures from diabetes-susceptible males of this strain did not exhibit this increase in Ia antigens expression. A monoclonal antibody specific for mouse interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) eliminated this increase in Ia antigens expression. Interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production by EMCV-D-infected spleen cell cultures were monitored at 4-hour intervals for 24 hours. Female spleen cells produced IFN gamma earlier (less than 16 hours PI) and in greater amounts than did comparably treated male spleen cells. Addition of a monoclonal rat anti-mouse IL-2 to virus-infected cultures did not significantly affect the early (less than 16 hours PI) production of IFN gamma by spleen cells of females. Treatment of the spleen cell donors with rabbit anti-asialo GM1 (AAGM1) abolished early production of IFN gamma in virus-infected female spleen cell cultures and reduced the early IL-2 production by infected male and female cells. These results suggest that an NK-like cell is responsible for the early female IFN gamma production; this may be a factor in the resistance of female ICR Swiss mice to EMCV-D-induced diabetes."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	2986878	Immunologic behavior of lymphocytes in experimental viral myocarditis: significance of T lymphocytes in the severity of myocarditis and silent myocarditis in BALB/c-nu/nu mice.	"To clarify the immune mechanism in myocarditis, we examined by immunofluorescence techniques the serial changes in percentages of T and B lymphocytes in the heart, spleen, and peripheral blood of DBA/2 mice inoculated with encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus (experiment I). B cells were demonstrated by staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled rabbit antimouse immunoglobulin (Ig). T cells were demonstrated with rat anti-Thy1.2 monoclonal antibody plus FITC-labeled antimouse Ig. There was a marked decrease in T cells in peripheral blood and a moderate decrease in the cells in the spleen on day 14. There were no significant changes in B cells in peripheral blood or spleen throughout the entire period and T cells accounted for approximately 80% of the cells in the myocardium on days 7 and 14. To confirm the involvement of T cells in the development of myocarditis, we also carried out studies in which BALB/c-nu/nu mice (group 1, n = 58), BALB/c-nu/+ mice (group 2, n = 54), and BALB/c-nu/nu mice injected with 5 X 10(7) spleen cells from BALB/c-nu/+ mice (group 3, n = 50) were inoculated with EMC virus (experiment II). Four mice from each of the three groups were killed on day 6 for virologic studies. In experiment II, there were no significant differences in the incidence of myocarditis among the three groups. Virus titrations of the heart and serum neutralizing antibody titers did not show any significant differences between the three groups on days 6 and 16.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"	0

"Animal models of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) provide a uniquely valuable tool for understanding the pathogenesis of this disease. To the extent that they represent the human disease, they permit innovative approaches to its study. Four animal models--the BB rat, the nonobese diabetic mouse, the streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse, and the encephalomyocarditis virus-infected mouse--are reviewed. The salient characteristics of each model and the various techniques and immunotherapeutic agents used in conjunction with them to study prevention and reversal of IDDM are described, particularly the modulatory techniques directed at the cellular cytotoxic system, the regulatory immune system, and the beta-cell."	1
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	3315367	Effects of environmental factors on the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.	"The development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is thought to be dependent on either the autoimmunity or the interaction of environmental agents with the pancreatic beta cells, or both in a genetically susceptible host. As environmental factors affecting the induction of type I diabetes, diabetogenic chemicals and viruses are likely candidates as primary injurious agents for pancreatic beta cells in man and animal. A number of structurally diverse chemicals including alloxan, streptozotocin, chlorozotocin, vacor, and cyproheptadine are diabetogenic mainly in rodents and sometimes in man. The possible mechanisms for the beta cell destruction by these chemicals include (a) generation of oxygen free radicals and alteration of endogenous scavengers of these reactive species; (b) breakage of DNA and consequent increase in the activity of poly ADP ribose synthetase, and enzyme depleting NAD in beta cells; and (c) inhibition of active calcium transport and calmodulin-activated protein kinase activity. Regarding viruses, a number of different viruses including encephalomyocarditis virus, Mengovirus, Coxsackie B viruses, and Reoviruses can infect and destroy pancreatic beta cells mainly in rodents and sometimes in humans. In the murine model, the development of encephalomyocarditis and Coxsackie B virus-induced diabetes is dependent on the genetic background of the host and the genetic makeup of the virus. Mengo-2T virus has caused diabetes in strains of mice resistant to encephalomyocarditis virus-induced diabetes. In contrast to encephalomyocarditis virus, Coxsackie B viruses, and Mengovirus, reovirus type 1 seems to be somewhat associated with an autoimmune response in the induction of diabetes. In addition to the murine model, cotton rats become diabetic when inoculated with Mengovirus 2T. Furthermore, cumulative environmental insults with Coxsackie B viruses and chemicals result in diabetes in non-human primates. In man, there may be 2 possible roles for viruses in the pathogenesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The one is acute cytolytic infection of beta cells (e.g., Coxsackie B viruses), which may sometimes induce diabetes in genetically predisposed individuals, and the other one is slow and persistent infection (e.g., congenital cytomegalovirus and Rubella), which may induce autoimmunity, leading to type I diabetes."	0

(Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio), and H. Earle Swim. Replication of mengovirus. I. Effect on synthesis of macromolecules by host cell. J. Bacteriol. 91:2317-2326. 1966.-The replication of mengovirus was studied in two strains of Novikoff (rat) hepatoma cells propagated in vitro. The replicative cycle in both strains required 6.5 to 7 hr. Infection resulted in a marked depression of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein synthesis by strain N1S1-63. Inhibition of RNA synthesis was reflected by a decrease in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent RNA polymerase activity of isolated nuclei. Mengovirus had no effect on either protein or RNA synthesis or on the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of a second strain, N1S1-67. The time course of viral-induced synthesis of RNA by cells was studied in cells treated with actinomycin D. It was first detectable between 2.5 and 3 hr after infection and continued until 6.5 to 7 hr. The formation of mature virus was estimated biochemically by measuring the amount of RNA synthesized as a result of viral infection which was resistant to degradation by ribonuclease in the presence of deoxycholate. Approximately 70% of the deoxycholate-ribonuclease-resistant RNA was located in mature virus, and the remainder was double-stranded. The formation of mature virus began about 45 min after viral-directed (actinomycin-resistant) synthesis of RNA was detectable in the cell, and only about 18 to 20% of the total RNA synthesized was incorporated into virus. Release of virus from cells began about 1 hr after maturation was first detectable. Release of virus from cells was accompanied by a loss of a large proportion of their cytoplasmic RNA and protein."	0

It requires daily treatment and serious late complications are observed. Good animal models exist for studying diabetes. These can be categorized as animals with spontaneously developing diabetes (BB rats, NOD mice) and as animals with induced diabetes (e.g. by virus). Immunodeficient nude mice have also been widely used. None of the models is perfect, but each has contributed to our present knowledge of the disease. Studies on the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes are given as an example. Recently, experience with prophylactic treatment of animals in order to prevent diabetes has been applied to humans with promising results."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	9726440	Cytokines produced early in picornavirus infection reflect resistance or susceptibility to disease.	"Gender bias favoring female resistance to picornavirus disease is not seen in ICR Swiss mice following infection with the MM strain of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (causing encephalitis and death) as it is with D variant of EMCV (causing diabetes in males). To define this difference, an in vitro virus-infected splenocyte culture system was used to explore virus effects on lymphoid cells. Infected and sham-infected splenocyte cultures, prepared from both genders of mice and infected with either virus variant, were examined for immunoregulatory cytokines in the first 24 h of infection using ELISA or bioassays. Disease resistance was associated with increased levels of interferon-y (IFN-gamma) and undetectable levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) by 12 h postinfection in splenocytes from ICR Swiss females infected with EMCV-D. Disease susceptibility was associated with high levels of IL-10 at 12 h after infection of spleen cells from ICR Swiss males infected with EMCV-D or from both genders infected with EMCV-MM. This information was used to protect susceptible mice against picornavirus disease (either diabetes or death) by giving them an inducer of IFN-alpha/beta, to induce natural killer (NK)-like cells to produce high levels of IFN-gamma and rat monoclonal anti-IL-10 to neutralize the effects of mouse IL-10."	0

"Replication of the D variant of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC-D) and its cytopathic effects were studied in the brain slice cultures including hippocampus (hippocampal slice) obtained from postnatal 1-, 4-, 7-, 14-, 28-and 56-day-old Fischer 344 rats. At 0, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after infection, virus titres of the slices and culture media were assayed. Viral replication was observed in cultures from 1-to 28-day-old rats, and the highest titre was recorded in the slice and culture medium from the youngest rat. The peak of virus titre decreased with age and no distinct viral replication was observed in the cultures from 56-day-old rats. Light microscopy revealed that degenerative and necrotic changes appeared in the infected hippocampal slices from 1- to 28-day-old rats, and the changes became less prominent with age. In situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence staining showed that positive signals of viral RNA and antigen were prominent in younger rats and decreased with age. These results suggest that an age-related decrease in the susceptibility of rat brain to EMC-D is less related to the maturation of the immune system but possibly to that of the neurone."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	11423934	Recombinant AAV vectors containing the foot and mouth disease virus 2A sequence confer efficient bicistronic gene expression in cultured cells and rat substantia nigra neurons.	"Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are promising vectors for gene therapy since they efficiently and stably transduce a variety of tissues of immunocompetent animals. The major disadvantage of rAAVs is their limited capacity to package foreign DNA (< or =5 kb). Often, co-expression of two or more genes from a single viral vector is desirable to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy or to track transduced cells in vivo by suitable reporter genes. The internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence of encephalomyocarditis virus has been widely used to construct bicistronic viral vectors. However, the IRES is rather long and IRES-mediated translation can be relatively inefficient when compared with cap-dependent translation. As an alternative to the IRES for in vivo gene expression, we studied the 16 amino-acid long 2A peptide of foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). The 2A peptide mediates the primary cis-'cleavage' of the FMDV polyprotein in a cascade of processing events that ultimately generate the mature FMDV proteins. We have generated several different rAAV genomes in which two coding regions are fused in-frame via the FMDV 2A sequence. We show that FMDV 2A efficiently mediates the generation of the expected cleavage products from the artificial fusion proteins in cells. Furthermore, we find that both EGFP and alpha- synuclein are expressed at substantially higher levels from 2A vectors than from the corresponding IRES-based vectors, while SOD-1 is expressed at comparable or slightly higher levels. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time, that the 2A sequence results in effective bicistronic gene expression in vivo after injection of 2A-dependent rAAVs into the rat substantia nigra. We conclude that 2A-containing rAAVs may represent an attractive alternative to IRES-dependent vectors for ex vivo and in vivo gene expression and gene therapy."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	16038091	Use of animal models for space flight physiology studies, with special focus on the immune system.	"Animal models have been used to study the effects of space flight on physiological systems. The animal models have been used because of the limited availability of human subjects for studies to be carried out in space as well as because of the need to carry out experiments requiring samples and experimental conditions that cannot be performed using humans. Experiments have been carried out in space using a variety of species, and included developmental biology studies. These species included rats, mice, non-human primates, fish, invertebrates, amphibians and insects. The species were chosen because they best fit the experimental conditions required for the experiments. Experiments with animals have also been carried out utilizing ground-based models that simulate some of the effects of exposure to space flight conditions. Most of the animal studies have generated results that parallel the effects of space flight on human physiological systems. Systems studied have included the neurovestibular system, the musculoskeletal system, the immune system, the neurological system, the hematological system, and the cardiovascular system. Hindlimb unloading, a ground-based model of some of the effects of space flight on the immune system, has been used to study the effects of space flight conditions on physiological parameters. For the immune system, exposure to hindlimb unloading has been shown to results in alterations of the immune system similar to those observed after space flight. This has permitted the development of experiments that demonstrated compromised resistance to infection in rodents maintained in the hindlimb unloading model as well as the beginning of studies to develop countermeasures to ameliorate or prevent such occurrences. Although there are limitations to the use of animal models for the effects of space flight on physiological systems, the animal models should prove very valuable in designing countermeasures for exploration class missions of the future."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus a	16952370	Pathogenesis of experimental encephalomyocarditis: a histopathological, immunohistochemical and virological study in mice.	"Mice (n=20) aged 8 weeks were infected, either by oronasal inoculation or by contact, with one of two different myocardial strains of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), namely, the Greek strain 424/90 and the Belgian strain B279/95. The animals were killed at 18-59 days post-infection (dpi), except for two mice that died at 6 and 32 dpi, and samples of brain, heart, pancreas, kidney, Peyer's patches, spleen, lung and thymus were processed for virological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Apart from the two deaths, the experimental infection was inapparent, but virus was invariably recovered from faeces and several organs. The main histopathological lesions were focal interstitial pancreatitis, depletion of thymus and Peyer's patches, and interstitial pneumonia. Additionally, in the two mice that died, multifocal interstitial myocarditis was observed. EMCV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of pancreatic acinar cells and in macrophages of the lung and the thymus. Antigen was also detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells from three animals, including the two that died. The results support the role of mice, in addition to rats, as reservoir hosts in the epidemiology of EMCV infections on pig farms."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cardiovirus c	25316698	Detection of zoonotic pathogens and characterization of novel viruses carried by commensal Rattus norvegicus in New York City.	"Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are globally distributed and concentrate in urban environments, where they live and feed in closer proximity to human populations than most other mammals. Despite the potential role of rats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat populations remains unexplored. In this study, we used targeted molecular assays to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human disease in commensal Norway rats in New York City. We found that these rats are infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis in people, including atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including Bartonella spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis, Leptospira interrogans, and Seoul hantavirus. We also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. The two novel hepaciviruses discovered in this study replicate in the liver of Norway rats and may have utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis C virus infection. The results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments. Importance: The observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. Strikingly, less attention has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in urban centers and close proximity to human populations. To begin to explore the zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed Norway rats collected in New York City over a 1-year period. This analysis revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or febrile illnesses in people. Our findings indicate that urban rats are reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks associated with urban rodent infestation."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	204271	Identification and study of a poxvirus isolated from wild rodents in Turkmenia.	"A new poxvirus was isolated in 1974 from the kidney of a wild big gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) caught in Turkmenia, where these gerbils are wide-spread. The virus resembles cowpox virus and is markedly different from the virus of infectious ectromelia, the best-known poxvirus of rodents. The new virus is apparently identical to other poxvirus isolates made from white rats and Felidae in the Moscow Zoo. Experimental inoculation of the natural hosts--big gerbils and yellow susliks (Citellus fulvus)--produced a severe infection with a high mortality rate. Trnasmission of virus to uninoculated cage mates was shown to occur. Virus persisted in convalescent animals and was present in urine 3 weeks after inoculation and in kidney and testis for at least 5 weeks after inoculation. The role of rodents as natural hosts of poxviruses is discussed."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	21314965	Recovery of infectious virus from full-length cowpox virus (CPXV) DNA cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC).	"Transmission from pet rats and cats to humans as well as severe infection in felids and other animal species have recently drawn increasing attention to cowpox virus (CPXV). We report the cloning of the entire genome of cowpox virus strain Brighton Red (BR) as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) in Escherichia coli and the recovery of infectious virus from cloned DNA. Generation of a full-length CPXV DNA clone was achieved by first introducing a mini-F vector, which allows maintenance of large circular DNA in E. coli, into the thymidine kinase locus of CPXV by homologous recombination. Circular replication intermediates were then electroporated into E. coli DH10B cells. Upon successful establishment of the infectious BR clone, we modified the full-length clone such that recombination-mediated excision of bacterial sequences can occur upon transfection in eukaryotic cells. This self-excision of the bacterial replicon is made possible by a sequence duplication within mini-F sequences and allows recovery of recombinant virus progeny without remaining marker or vector sequences. The in vitro growth properties of viruses derived from both BAC clones were determined and found to be virtually indistinguishable from those of parental, wild-type BR. Finally, the complete genomic sequence of the infectious clone was determined and the cloned viral genome was shown to be identical to that of the parental virus. In summary, the generated infectious clone will greatly facilitate studies on individual genes and pathogenesis of CPXV. Moreover, the vector potential of CPXV can now be more systematically explored using this newly generated tool."	0

"Eight novel single amino acid (6-11) and dipeptide (12, 13) tyrosine P-O esters of cyclic cidofovir ((S)-cHPMPC, 4) and its cyclic adenine analogue ((S)-cHPMPA, 3) were synthesized and evaluated as prodrugs. In vitro IC(50) values for the prodrugs (<0.1-50 μM) vs vaccinia, cowpox, human cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex type 1 virus were compared to those for the parent drugs ((S)-HPMPC, 2; (S)-HPMPA, 1; IC(50) 0.3-35 μM); there was no cytoxicity with KB or HFF cells at ≤100 μM. The prodrugs exhibited a wide range of half-lives in rat intestinal homogenate at pH 6.5 (<30-1732 min) with differences of 3-10× between phostonate diastereomers. The tyrosine alkylamide derivatives of 3 and 4 were the most stable.

"Urban rats captured in Seoul and four nearby Korean cities were found to have immunofluorescent antibodies reactive with Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF). Serum antibodies were detected in 13% from 477 Rattus norvegicus and 11% of 47 Rattus rattus. Hantaan viral antigen was found in pulmonary tissues of 42 animals, and Hantaan virus was recovered from 23 rats, all but two of which were R. norvegicus. Wistar rats were qualitatively much more sensitive than Apodemus agrarius rodents for isolation of virus from tissues of wild rats. Wistar rats inoculated with one of these strains had virus in lung and spleen for at least 75 days. These results document the existence of an urban cycle for Hantaan virus, which had been suspected on the basis of the occurrence of sporadic urban cases in humans of KHF, and suggest that Rattus-borne Hantaan virus may be widely distributed in urban centers."	0

rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	6442757	Experimental infection in newborn mice and rats by hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) virus.	"Newborn mice and rats were inoculated intracerebrally (ic) or intraperitoneally (ip) with Hantaan virus (76-118 strain) or HFRS-related virus (B-1 strain). The mortality and the influence on the increase of body weight in newborn mice were higher in the groups infected with the 76-118 strain than in the groups infected with the B-1 strain, while the B-1 strain was more virulent in rats than the 76-118 strain. Virus isolation from rats inoculated with either strain was attempted 7 and 11 weeks after inoculation. Virus could be isolated from various organs of rats infected with the B-1 strain, while it was recovered from only the brain and lungs of rats infected with the 76-118 strain. Viral antigen was readily detected in various organs of rats infected with the B-1 strain, but the amount and distribution of antigens were less in rats infected with the 76-118 strain. Our results suggest that the virulence of HFRS-related virus is variable, depending on the species of infected animals as well as on the virus strains. The virus also persists in the injected animals with high titers of antibodies for at least 11 weeks."	0

"Comparing the difference of virulence between the strain CGRn5310 (HTNV) and the strain HR54 (SEOV) isolated both from Rattus norvegicus., Suckling mice were used to compare the difference of virulence between the two strains. Hantavirus antigens were detected in brain and lung tissues collected from the infected mice., Compared with the control group, all infected mice grew slowly. Furthermore, the mice inoculated intracerebrally with either CGRn5310 or HR45 appeared ruffled fur, and reduced activity, followed by neurological symptoms, such as paralyses and convulsions. The half lethal dose (LD(50)) of CGRn5310 strain was 10(-6.42), whereas the LD(50) of HR54 strain was 10(-4.51). Hantavirus antigens were identified in brain and lung tissues from the mice infected with the strain CGRn5310 and the strain HR54., LD(50) of the strain CGRn5310 was significantly higher than that of the strain HR54.

"Truncated recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (trNs) that lack N-terminally located cross-reactive epitopes of four Murinae rodent-associated hantaviruses, Seoul virus (SEOV), Thailand virus, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Dobrava-Belgrade virus, were produced by using a baculovirus expression system. ELISA with the trNs as antigens enabled serotyping of immune sera from rats experimentally inoculated with the corresponding hantaviruses with cut-off OD values of 60% of those of whole N of HTNV. The trN-based ELISA could serotype 12 out of 13 sera obtained from wild rodents (Rattus norvegicus) naturally infected with SEOV using the 60% cut-off value. These results indicate that screening with whole N followed by serotyping with trNs using a cut-off OD value of 60% of that of whole N is a useful method for serological surveillance of Murinae-associated hantavirus infection among rodents."	0

"An experimental rat model to study acute cytomegalovirus infections is described. Eight-week old male Brown Norway rats, immunosuppressed by total body irradiation, were infected with rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV). The effects of infection were determined by survival rates and the presence of virus or viral components in different organs was assayed by plaque test, immunoperoxidase staining, dot-blot DNA hybridization and in situ DNA hybridization. At days 10-post infection nearly 90% of the animals had died. Spleen, liver and bone marrow were heavily infected. Interstitial pneumonia was observed. Pathological findings strongly resembled the full scale of lesions in human CMV infections. Anti-RCMV hyperimmune serum was effective against mortality from RCMV infection and viral spread to lungs and liver was prevented. This model is appropriate for studies on the pathogenesis and antiviral therapy of CMV infections in the immunocompromised host."	0

"Major risk factors for accelerated allograft arteriosclerosis include humoral and cellular immune response, hyperlipidemia, and viral infections. We demonstrated earlier that rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) infection doubles smooth muscle cell proliferation and intimal thickening of rat aortic allografts. In this study, the effects of 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxymethyl)guanine (DHPG) on RCMV-enhanced rat allograft arteriosclerosis are investigated., Aortic allografts from the DA to the WF rat strain were used. The recipients were inoculated with 10(5) plaque-forming units of RCMV 1 day after transplantation. Two groups of RCMV-infected rats were treated with DHPG with an initial dose of 20 mg/kg IP and a maintenance dose of 10 mg/kg IP twice a day for a period of 14 days. In the DHPG prophylaxis group (n = 22), the drug administration started 1 day before infection, and in the DHPG treatment group (n = 17), 7 days after infection. One group of infected rats was left untreated (n = 21). The grafts were removed 7 and 14 days and 1, 3, and 6 months after transplantation. In the DHPG prophylaxis group, no virus could be recovered by plaque assays. In the treatment group, 50% of rats were virus-positive at 1 month and 40% at 3 months. DHPG prophylaxis prevented the infiltration of inflammatory cells and their proliferation in the adventitia of RCMV-infected recipients (P < .01), with a 60% reduction in the interleukin-2 receptor expression (P < .05) and a 30% decrease in major histocompatibility complex class II expression (P = NS). DHPG prophylaxis did not significantly alter the levels of insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, transforming growth factor-beta 1, acidic fibroblast growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor messages in the allograft vascular wall. Early media necrosis was reduced. Arteriosclerotic alterations and proliferation of smooth muscle cells were both reduced 50% to 70% by DHPG prophylaxis (P < .05 at 3 months). The responses in the DHPG treatment group were quite similar but less impressive and statistically nonsignificant., We consider it likely that DHPG inhibits arteriosclerotic alterations primarily by reducing the infectious virus and thereby the inflammatory response in the allograft vascular wall; another possibility is a direct antiproliferative effect on smooth muscle cell replication. A dose-dependent inhibitory effect of DHPG on smooth muscle cell replication was recorded in an in vitro study."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	8139014	Tumor necrosis factor alpha promotes replication and pathogenicity of rat cytomegalovirus.	"We investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in the pathogenesis of rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) infection. TNF-alpha levels found in the sera of radiation-immunosuppressed rats in the course of infection (> 350 pg/ml) correlated with the development of RCMV disease. Administration of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies strongly reduced the severity of pneumonia and led to a reduction in virus titers. In immunocompetent rats, anti-TNF-alpha antibodies also significantly suppressed viral replication. Conversely, administration of TNF-alpha augmented RCMV replication and aggravated the disease signs. In vitro, TNF-alpha enhanced RCMV replication in the macrophage, whereas a reduction of viral replication was observed in fibroblasts, indicating that the effect on viral replication is cell type specific. Besides activation of viral replication and exacerbation of RCMV disease, TNF-alpha also favored lymphoid and hematopoietic tissue reconstitution after irradiation, which may contribute to antiviral resistance and survival. This finding demonstrates the protean nature of TNF-alpha, with both beneficial and adverse effects for the host. Our results suggest that TNF-alpha plays an important role in modulating the pathogenesis of RCMV infection."	0

"We analysed the production of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) during a cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in a rat model system. Splenocytes from immunocompetent rats infected with rat CMV (RCMV) released increased amounts of TGF-beta1. TGF-beta production was also evident in RCMV-infected radiation-immunosuppressed rats; their sera inhibited the interleukin 2-induced proliferation of T cells, which could be restored by anti-TGF-beta antibodies. In addition, TGF-beta production could be visualized immunohistologically in the lungs, spleen, liver and bone marrow of radiation-immunosuppressed infected rats. The virus directly induced this cytokine since TGF-beta was produced upon RCMV infection in vitro. The induction of TGF-beta production may contribute to immunosuppression during CMV infection."	0

"There is increasing evidence for cytomegalovirus (CMV) induced vascular pathology during acute infection in the immunocompromised host. Inflammation is involved in such processes, which is frequently associated with increased levels of oxidative mediators and reduced anti-oxidant protection. A relation between viral infection and oxidative stress has been recognized for human immunodeficiency virus and herpes simplex virus-1 infections, but little is known in this respect for CMV infections. We investigated if there is a relation between CMV infection of vascular cells and the intracellular redox status using an in vitro rat model. We measured intracellular glutathione levels and rat CMV (RCMV) permissiveness of rat heart endothelial cell lines (RHEC), rat smooth muscle cells (RSMC), and compared these with fully CMV-permissive rat fibroblasts (REF and Rat 2). In addition, the effects of the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximide (BSO) on CMV permissiveness and replication were investigated in these cell lines. Finally, we investigated infection of vascular cells under inflammatory conditions in an in vivo rat model for acute CMV infection. The results show a very high endogenous glutathione level in RHEC compared to REF, Rat 2 cells and RSMC. This is associated with a low CMV permissiveness in RHEC as opposed to full permissiveness in REF, Rat 2 cells and RSMC in vitro. In addition, modulation of the intracellular thiol redox status affected CMV infection and replication only in RHEC, but not in RSMC and Rat 2 cells. During acute infection in vivo under immunosuppressed conditions rat endothelial cells first become activated and subsequently infected leading to vascular damage and pathology. This study suggests that a high endogenous thiol redox status may contribute to the apparent barrier function of endothelial cells with respect of CMV infection and that oxidative stress may facilitate CMV infection of the vascular wall."	0

"The potential for chemicals to adversely affect human immunologic health has traditionally been evaluated in rodents, under laboratory conditions. These laboratory studies have generated valuable hazard identification and immunotoxicologic mechanism data; however, genetically diverse populations exposed in the wild may better reflect both human exposure conditions and may provide insight into potential immunotoxic effects in humans. In addition, comparative studies of species occupying reference and impacted sites provide important information on the effects of environmental pollution on the immunologic health of wildlife populations. In this symposium overview, Peter Hodson describes physiological changes in fish collected above or below the outflows of paper mills discharging effluent from the bleaching process (BKME). Effects attributable to BKME were identified, as were physiological changes attributable to other environmental factors. In this context, he discussed the problems of identifying true cause and effect relationships in field studies. Mohamed Faisal described changes in immune function of fish collected from areas with high levels of polyaromatic hydrocarbon contamination. His studies identified a contaminant-related decreases in the ability of anterior kidney leukocytes to bind to and kill tumor cell line targets, as well as changes in lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens. Altered proliferative responses of fish from the contaminated site were partially reversed by maintaining fish in water from the reference site. Peter Ross described studies in which harbor seals were fed herring obtained from relatively clean (Atlantic Ocean) and contaminated (Baltic Sea) waters. Decreased natural killer cell activity and lymphoproliferative responses to T and B cell mitogens, as well as depressed antibody and delayed hypersensitivity responses to injected antigens, were identified in seals fed contaminated herring. In laboratory studies, it was determined that rats fed freeze-dried Baltic Sea herring had higher virus titers after challenge with rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) than rats fed Atlantic Ocean herring; perinatal exposure of rats to oil extracted from Baltic herring also reduced the response to challenge with RCMV. Keith Grassman reported an association between exposure to polyhalogenated aryl hydrocarbons and decreased T cell immunity in the offspring of fish-eating birds (herring gulls and Capsian terns) at highly contaminated sites in the Great Lakes. The greatest suppression of skin test responses to phytohemagglutinin injection (an indicator of T cell immunity) was consistently found at sites with the highest contaminant concentrations. Judith Zelikoff addressed the applicability of immunotoxicity studies developed in laboratory-reared fish for detecting altered immune function in wild populations. She presented data from studies done in her laboratory with environmentally relevant concentrations of metals as examples. Although the necessity of proceeding with caution when extrapolating across species was emphasized, she concluded that published data, and results presented by the other Symposium participants, demonstrate that assays similar to those developed for use in laboratory rodents may be useful for detecting immune system defects in wildlife species directly exposed to toxicants present in the environment."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	9657952	The Maastricht strain and England strain of rat cytomegalovirus represent different betaherpesvirus species rather than strains.	"The major immediate early (MIE) locus of the Maastricht strain of rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) was found to comprise five exons of which the first is noncoding. The first three exons are spliced to either exon 4, generating IE1, or exon 5, generating IE2. An additional splicing event unique to RCMV (Maastricht) was identified in exon 5, resulting in a 466-bp deletion. IE1 transcripts were detected exclusively during the IE phase of infection in vitro, whereas IE2 transcripts were detected during both the IE and late phase of infection. The similarities between amino acid sequences derived from the MIE gene of RCMV (Maastricht) and murine cytomegalovirus are low (22 and 37% for IE1 and IE2, respectively). Surprisingly, the similarities between the MIE proteins of RCMV (Maastricht) and the England strain of RCMV are also low (23 and 32% for IE1 and IE2, respectively). This suggests that these RCMV strains represent different betaherpesvirus species rather than strains. This is underscored by the difference between both viruses in genome size as well as growth characteristics. The existence of two different RCMV-like species might have important implications for the use of these viruses as models for human cytomegalovirus."	0

"The goal of these studies was to determine whether neonatal viral exposure leads to a deficit in information processing in adulthood. To accomplish this, rats were infected neonatally with rat cytomegalovirus, and acoustic startle responses were measured when rats were 120 days old. Acoustic startle was elicited by using a 118-decibel (dB) white noise alone or after a prepulse 10 dB above background (65 dB); responses were measured after an injection of saline or the dopamine agonist apomorphine. Response amplitudes after the pulse alone were not significantly altered by either viral exposure or apomorphine. Responses of animals exposed to the prepulse before the pulse were approximately 10% of that after the pulse alone and did not differ between control or virus-exposed animals injected with saline. Animals injected with apomorphine exhibited a greater startle response than animals injected with saline, and control and virus-exposed rats injected with apomorphine differed in the magnitude of their responses. Apomorphine attenuated responses after the prepulse, and virus-exposed animals exhibited more than twice the attenuation than non-virus-exposed animals. Analysis of prepulse inhibition, calculated from the acoustic startle data, indicated that although viral exposure alone did not significantly affect information processing, when virus-injected rats were exposed to apomorphine, a significant 38% decrease in prepulse inhibition was apparent. Findings demonstrate that rats infected neonatally with rat cytomegalovirus exhibit a deficit in sensorimotor gating upon dopamine stimulation, supporting a possible link between viral infection and schizophrenia."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	10785292	Production of high-titer stocks of the English strain of rat cytomegalovirus.	"A simple technique to increase dramatically the yield of rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) from infected monolayers of a rat embryo fibroblast-derived cell line is described. The method, which involves daily changes of the cell culture medium, can result in a 50000-fold amplification of virus from cell monolayers inoculated with only a few RCMV particles. This modification of the standard in vitro culture technique to amplify viral yield can be used to increase the sensitivity of the plaque assay for detecting very small amounts of infectious virus in organ homogenates of RCMV infected animals."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	12038690	A rat cytomegalovirus strain with a disruption of the r144 MHC class I-like gene is attenuated in the acute phase of infection in neonatal rats.	"We previously generated an RCMV strain in which the r144 gene, encoding a major histocompatibility complex class I homolog, had been deleted (RCMVdelta r144). To investigate the role of r144 during acute infection of neonatal rats, we infected three days-old neonatal rats with either RCMVdelta r144 or wild type (wt) RCMV and the presence of infectious virus as well as viral DNA in various organs was determined at either 3, 5 or 21 days p.i.. In addition, we assessed both type and number of inflammatory cells in these organs. Interestingly, a significantly lower concentration of infectious virus as well as viral DNA was found in spleens of RCMVdelta r144-infected rats than in those of wt RCMV-infected animals at 3 days p.i.. At the same time point, a significantly lower amount of infiltrating NK cells and monocytes/macrophages was seen in the spleens of RCMVdelta r144-infected rats than in spleens of rats infected with wt RCMV. At 21 days p.i., RCMVdelta r144-infected rats were found to have lower virus titers in the salivary glands than wt RCMV-infected animals. Significant differences between RCMVdelta r144- and wt RCMV-infected rats were detected neither at other time points nor at other sites. We conclude that after infection of neonatal rats, the replication of RCMVdelta r144 is severely restricted compared to wt RCMV."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	12917474	The rat cytomegalovirus R78 G protein-coupled receptor gene is required for production of infectious virus in the spleen.	"The rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) R33 and R78 genes are conserved within members of the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae and encode proteins (pR33 and pR78, respectively) that show sequence similarity with G protein-coupled receptors. Previously, the biological relevance of these genes was demonstrated by the finding that R33- and R78-deleted RCMV strains are severely attenuated in vivo. In addition, R78-deleted strains were found to replicate less efficiently in cell culture. To monitor of the expression of R33- and R78-encoded proteins, recombinant RCMV strains, designated RCMV33G and RCMV78G, were generated. These recombinants expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged versions of pR33 and pR78 instead of native pR33 and pR78, respectively. Here it is reported that, although RCMV33G replicates as efficiently as wt virus in rat embryo fibroblast cultures, strain RCMV78G produces virus titres that are 3- to 4-fold lower than wt RCMV in the culture medium. This result indicates that the pR78-EGFP protein, as expressed by RCMV78G, does not completely functionally replace its native counterpart (pR78) in vitro. Interestingly, in infected rats, infectious RCMV33G was produced in significantly lower amounts than infectious wt RCMV, as well as RCMV78G, in the salivary glands. Conversely, although RCMV33G replicated to similar levels as wt virus in the spleen, both RCMV78G and an R78 knock-out strain (RCMV Delta R78a) replicated poorly in this organ. Together, these data indicate that R78 is crucial for the production of infectious RCMV in the spleen of infected rats."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	15919911	Predicting coding potential from genome sequence: application to betaherpesviruses infecting rats and mice.	"Prediction of protein-coding regions and other features of primary DNA sequence have greatly contributed to experimental biology. Significant challenges remain in genome annotation methods, including the identification of small or overlapping genes and the assessment of mRNA splicing or unconventional translation signals in expression. We have employed a combined analysis of compositional biases and conservation together with frame-specific G+C representation to reevaluate and annotate the genome sequences of mouse and rat cytomegaloviruses. Our analysis predicts that there are at least 34 protein-coding regions in these genomes that were not apparent in earlier annotation efforts. These include 17 single-exon genes, three new exons of previously identified genes, a newly identified four-exon gene for a lectin-like protein (in rat cytomegalovirus), and 10 probable frameshift extensions of previously annotated genes. This expanded set of candidate genes provides an additional basis for investigation in cytomegalovirus biology and pathogenesis."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	16325931	The anti-malaria drug artesunate inhibits replication of cytomegalovirus in vitro and in vivo.	"Treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections with any of the currently available antiviral agents is frequently associated with the occurrence of severe complications, seriously threatening the successful outcome of treatment. Therefore, the development of novel antiviral strategies is a challenging goal of current investigations. Previously, we reported that artesunate (ART) is an effective, non-cytotoxic inhibitor of HCMV in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that the efficacy of the antiviral effect of ART is augmented by co-treatment of HCMV-infected fibroblasts with ferrous iron, i.e. Ferrosanol, and/or the iron transfer-mediating molecule holo-transferrin. This could alleviate the HCMV-induced modulation of cell surface expression of adhesion molecule Thy-1, suggesting that ART might be able to prevent pro-inflammatory effects of infection. The iron-enhanced, antiviral effect of ART could also be demonstrated in cultured cells infected with rat cytomegalovirus. Experiments using the RCMV/rat model showed that both the viral DNA load and virus titers in the salivary glands from infected rats were significantly reduced upon treatment with ART. Furthermore, an additive antiviral effect for ART together with each one of conventional anti-HCMV drugs, i.e. ganciclovir, cidofovir or foscarnet, was detected in HCMV-infected fibroblasts. These findings might open new perspectives regarding the use of ART in clinical trials."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	16737550	Pathogenesis and vertical transmission of a transplacental rat cytomegalovirus.	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) congenital infection is the major viral cause of well-documented birth defects in human. Because CMV is species-specific, the main obstacle to developing animal models for congenital infection is the difference in placental architecture, which preludes virus transmission across the placenta. The rat placenta, resembling histologically to that of human, could therefore facilitate the study of CMV congenital infection in human., In this report, we present clear evidences of the transplacental property of a new rat CMV (RCMV), namely ALL-03, which had been isolated from placenta and uterus of the house rat. Our study signifies the detection of infectious virus, virus particles, viral protein and DNA as well as immune response to demonstrate a natural model of acute CMV infection including the immunocompetent and immunocompromised host associated with or without pregnancy. It is characterized by a full range of CMV related clinical signs; lesions and anatomical virus distribution to uterus, placenta, embryo, fetus, neonate, lung, kidney, spleen, liver and salivary gland of the infected rats in addition to the virus-specific seroconversion. The preference of the virus for different organs mimics the situation in immunocompromised man. Most interestingly, the placenta was observed to be involved in the maternofetal infection and hence confirmed the hypothesis that the RCMV strain ALL-03 is capable to cross the placenta and infect the offsprings congenitally., The maternal viremia leading to uterine infection which subsequently infecting to the fetus through the placenta is the most likely phenomenon of CMV vertical transmission in our study."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	17251289	Rat cytomegalovirus gene expression in cardiac allograft recipients is tissue specific and does not parallel the profiles detected in vitro.	"Rat cytomegalovirus (RCMV) is a beta-herpesvirus with a 230-kbp genome containing over 167 open reading frames (ORFs). RCMV gene expression is tightly regulated in cultured cells, occurring in three distinct kinetic classes (immediate early, early, and late). However, the extent of viral-gene expression in vivo and its relationship to the in vitro expression are unknown. In this study, we used RCMV-specific DNA microarrays to investigate the viral transcriptional profiles in cultured, RCMV-infected endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and aortic smooth muscle cells and to compare these profiles to those found in tissues from RCMV-infected rat heart transplant recipients. In cultured cells, RCMV expresses approximately 95% of the known viral ORFs with few differences between cell types. By contrast, in vivo viral-gene expression in tissues from rat heart allograft recipients is highly restricted. In the tissues studied, a total of 80 viral genes expressing levels twice above background (5,000 to 10,000 copies per mug total RNA) were detected. In each tissue type, there were a number of genes expressed exclusively in that tissue. Although viral mRNA and genomic DNA levels were lower in the spleen than in submandibular glands, the number of individual viral genes expressed was higher in the spleen (60 versus 41). This finding suggests that the number of viral genes expressed is specific to a given tissue and is not dependent upon the viral load or viral mRNA levels. Our results demonstrate that the profiles, as well as the amplitude, of viral-gene expression are tissue specific and are dramatically different from those in infected cultured cells, indicating that RCMV gene expression in vitro does not reflect viral-gene expression in vivo."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 8	6293409	The isolation and partial characterisation of a cytomegalovirus from the brown rat, Rattus norvegicus.	"This report describes the isolation and partial characterisation of a cytomegalovirus (CMV) from the wild brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). The isolate was sensitive to ether and heat treatment at 56 degrees C/30 minutes, and had a characteristic herpes virus morphology. In rat embryo fibroblast cells, new virus was detectable by 18 hours after inoculation. The cytopathic effect consisted of a focal rounding of cells which developed to involve the entire monolayer. Inoculation of newborn rats produced mortality of 67-75 per cent which was reduced to 33-46 per cent by intra-peritoneal inoculation or tissue culture passage. Highest virus concentrations were found in the liver and spleen 14 days after inoculation. The virus was also pathogenic (to a lesser extent) to newborn BALB/c mice. It was related to the Osborn strain of mouse CMV by fluorescent-antibody testing but distinct by the serum-neutralisation test."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	907478	Experimental infection of adult axenic rats with Parker's rat coronavirus.	"The pathogenesis of Parker's Rat Coronavirus (PRCV) was studied in axenic CD rats. Three to four 9 to 10 week old rats were euthanized daily for eight days after intranasal inoculation. Rats remained free of clinical disease. Virus was recovered from the nasopharynx and trachea after twenty-four hours and from the lung by day three but was not detected in respiratory tract after seven days. Viral antigen was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in the mucosal epithelium of upper respiratory tract and in pulmonary alveolar septae from day two to six postinoculation. Acute rhinitis developed by day two and was associated with mild focal necrosis of respiratory mucosal epithelium. Mild nonsuppurative tracheitis and multifocal interstitial pneumonia appeared by day five and persisted through day eight. Dacryoadenitis did not occur, sialoadenitis was detected in only three rats and virus was recovered from only one submaxillary salivary gland. This experiment indicates that PRCV can be a primary pathogen for the respiratory system of adult rats. In contrast to sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) virus the tropism of PRCV for salivary and lacrimal glands is low."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	12704434	NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Tribromomethane (Bromoform) (CAS No. 75-25-2) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).	"Tribromomethane, a chemical intermediate and solvent, has been identified as a drinking water contaminant resulting from water chlorination. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering tribromomethane (95%-97% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex once or for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Single-Administration, Fourteen-Day, and Thirteen-Week Studies: All rats that received 2,000 mg/kg and 3/5 males and 3/5 females that received 1,000 mg/kg tribromomethane died before the end of the single-administration studies. All mice that received 2,000 mg/kg, 4/5 males and 2/5 females that received 1,000 mg/kg, and 1/5 males that received 500 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Shallow breathing was observed for rats and male mice that received 1,000 or 2,000 mg/kg tribromomethane. In the 14-day studies, all rats that received 600 or 800 mg/kg and 1/5 males that received 400 mg/kg tribromomethane died before the end of the studies. The final mean body weight of male rats that received 400 mg/kg was 14% lower than that of vehicle controls. One of five male mice that received 600 mg/kg and 1/5 female mice that received 800 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Final mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control mice were comparable. None of the rats died before the end of the 13-week studies (doses ranged from 12 to 200 mg/kg). Final mean body weights were comparable for dosed and vehicle control rats. All male rats that received 100 or 200 mg/kg tribromomethane and all female rats that received 200 mg/kg were lethargic. The incidences of cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes in dosed male rats were slightly increased compared with that in vehicle controls. The severity of this lesion was increased in the 200 mg/kg group. One of 10 female mice that received 100 mg/kg tribromomethane died before the end of the 13-week studies. The final mean body weight of mice that received 400 mg/kg was 8% lower than that of vehicle controls for males and was comparable to that of vehicle controls for females. Cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes was observed in the liver of 5/10 male mice that received 200 mg/kg and in 8/10 male mice that received 400 mg/kg tribromomethane. Based on these results, 2-year studies of tribromomethane were conducted by administering 0, 100, or 200 mg/kg tribromomethane in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 F344/N rats of each sex and 50 female B6C3F1 mice. Male B6C3F1 mice were administered 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane on the same schedule. Body Weights and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male and female rats were 10%-28% lower than those of vehicle controls throughout the second year of the studies. Survival of the high dose group of male rats was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 91; no significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of female rats (male: vehicle control, 34/50; low dose, 30/50; high dose, 11/50; female: 34/50; 28/50; 28/50). Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control male mice were comparable throughout the study. Mean body weights of dosed female mice were 5%-16% lower than those of vehicle controls from week 28 to the end of the study. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of male mice; the survival of both dosed groups of female mice was significantly lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 77 (male: 41/50; 37/50; 36/50; female: 25/49; 15/50; 20/50). Reduced survival in all groups of female mice was partly due to a utero-ovarian infection; nonetheless, survival of all groups of female mice was at least 50% by week 92. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Uncommon adenomatous polyps or adenocarcinomas (combined) of the large intestine (colon or rectum) were induced in three male ratarge intestine (colon or rectum) were induced in three male rats (vehicle control, 0/50; low dose, 0/50; high dose, 3/50) and in nine female rats (0/50; 1/50; 8/50); the historical incidence of neoplasms of the large intestine is less than 0.2&percnt; in approximately 2,000 corn oil vehicle control male F344/N rats, and none has been observed in approximately 2,000 corn oil vehicle control female F344/N rats. Three of the neoplasms of the large intestine (one in the high dose male rats and two in the high dose female rats) were adenocarcinomas. Focal or diffuse fatty change of the liver was observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (male: 23/50; 49/50; 50/50; female: 19/50; 39/49; 46/50). Active chronic inflammation was observed at increased incidences in dosed male and high dose female rats (male: 0/50; 29/50; 23/50; female: 9/50; 8/49; 27/50). The incidence of necrosis of the liver was increased in high dose male rats (7/50; 3/50; 20/50) and decreased in dosed females (11/50; 3/49; 2/50). Mixed cell focus was observed at increased incidences in dosed female rats (8/50; 25/49; 28/50). Other nonneoplastic lesions observed at increased incidences in dosed rats included chronic active inflammation and squamous metaplasia of the ducts of the salivary gland (squamous metaplasia-- male: 0/50; 15/50; 31/48; female: 0/49; 10/49; 16/50; chronic active inflammation--male: 0/50; 16/50; 25/48; female: 0/49; 9/49; 18/50), squamous metaplasia of the prostate gland (2/49; 6/46; 12/50), ulcers of the forestomach (male: 1/49; 5/50; 10/50), and chronic active inflammation of the lung (male: 1/50; 7/50; 15/50). Pigmentation of the spleen was also observed at an increased incidence in high dose female rats. The salivary gland and lung lesions were characteristic of infection by rat coronavirus, a virus to which a positive serologic reaction was observed early in the studies. The incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was increased in high dose female mice (5/49; 4/49; 19/47), and fatty change of the liver was increased in both dosed groups of female mice (1/49; 9/50; 24/50). No chemically related adverse effects were observed in male mice. Neoplastic lesions that occurred at lower incidences in dosed animals compared with those in vehicle controls included preputial gland neoplasms in male rats (10/41; 5/38; 1/34), uterine stromal polyps in female rats (10/49; 9/50; 2/50), anterior pituitary gland adenomas in male and female rats (male: 12/50; 12/48; 2/45; female: 29/48; 12/46; 16/48), mammary gland fibroadenomas in female rats (22/50; 17/50; 6/50), and alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms in male mice (11/50; 7/50; 2/49). Other than concomitant decreases in body weights, no other reasons are obvious to correlate these decreases with chemical administration. Genetic Toxicology: Tribromomethane exhibited equivocal mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation and in strains TA97 and TA98 when exposure occurred in the presence of hamster S9; tribromomethane produced no increases in revertant colonies in TA1535 or TA1537 with or without exogenous metabolic activation. Tribromomethane induced trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y cells with and without metabolic activation. When tested incultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells for cytogenetic effects, tribromomethane produced an increase in both sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations in the absence, but not in the presence, of exogenous metabolic activation. Tribromomethane caused sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila when administered to adult males by feeding; no induction of mutations was observed when tribromomethane was administered by abdominal injection. Results of tests for reciprocal translocations in adult male Drosophila exposed to tribromomethane by feeding were negative. In vivo tests for cytogenetic effects in bone marrow cells of male B6C3F1 mice demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of tribromomethane induced an increase in SCEs but no increase in chromosomal aberrations. Intraperitoneal injection of tribromomethane also induced an increase in the incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of B6C3F1 mice. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of tribromomethane have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of tribromomethane for male F344/N rats and clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, based on increased incidences of uncommon neoplasms of the large intestine. Reduced survival for male rats given 200 mg/kg tribromomethane lowered the sensitivity of this group to detect a carcinogenic response. Chemically related nonneoplastic lesions included fatty change and active chronic inflammation of the liver in male and female rats, minimal necrosis of the liver in male rats, and mixed cell foci of the liver in female rats. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice given 50 or 100 mg/kg tribromomethane or for female B6C3F1 mice given 100 or 200 mg/kg; male mice might have been able to tolerate a higher dose. Survival of female mice was reduced, partly due to a utero-ovarian infection. Synonym: bromoform"	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	12724782	NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of Benzyl Alcohol (CAS No. 100-51-6) in F344/N Rats and B6C3F1 Mice (Gavage Studies).	"Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of technical-grade benzyl alcohol (99% pure), a textile dye additive, solvent, and food flavoring agent, were conducted by administering the chemical by gavage in corn oil vehicle to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Short-Term Studies: In 16-day studies, all five male and five female rats and mice dosed with 2,000 mg/kg benzyl alcohol died. Two of five male and 3/5 female rats and 1/5 male and 2/5 female mice dosed with 1,000 mg/kg died. Rats and mice of each sex in the two highest dose groups were lethargic after dosing. Other toxic responses to benzyl alcohol in these dose groups included blood around the mouth and nose, subcutaneous hemorrhages, and blood in the urinary and gastrointestinal tracts of rats and blood in the urinary bladder of mice. Animals administered lower doses of benzyl alcohol (125, 250, or 500 mg/kg) had no compound-related histologic lesions. Doses selected for the 13-week studies were 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg/kg for rats and mice. Eight of 10 male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg died during weeks 7 and 8; four of these deaths were described as gavage related. Rats dosed with 800 mg/kg exhibited clinical signs indicative of neurotoxicity including staggering, respiratory difficulty, and lethargy. Hemorrhages occurred around the mouth and nose, and there were histologic lesions in the brain, thymus, skeletal muscle, and kidney. In mice, deaths were scattered among all dose levels, but none occurred in vehicle controls. Four male and six female mice died after being dosed; all deaths but one were described as gavage related. Staggering after dosing also occurred during the first 2 weeks of the studies in mice dosed with 800 mg/kg. Some of the deaths in the rats and mice may have been caused by a combination of the gavage procedure and chemical toxicity, since there was evidence that benzyl alcohol induced neurotoxic effects. There were reductions in relative weight gain in male rats dosed with 800 mg/kg benzyl alcohol, in female rats dosed with 200 mg/kg or more, in male mice dosed with 400 or 800 mg/kg, and in female mice dosed with 200 mg/kg or more. No notable changes in body weight gain or compound-related histopathologic lesions were observed in rats or mice from the lower dose groups. Based on mortality, reduction in relative body weight gain, and the histopathologic lesions, doses selected for 2-year studies in rats were 0, 200, and 400 mg/kg. Doses selected for 2-year studies in mice were 0, 100, and 200 mg/kg, based on mortality and depression in relative body weight gain. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Fifty animals of each species and sex were administered benzyl alcohol in corn oil by gavage 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Administration of benzyl alcohol did not affect survival in male rats (final survival rates: vehicle control, 28/50; low dose, 27/50; high dose, 24/50) but reduced survival of dosed female rats by half (36/50; 18/50; 17/50). Many of the early deaths were considered related to the gavage procedure. Survival in mice was not affected by benzyl alcohol administration (male: 34/50; 33/50; 35/50; female: 26/50; 32/50; 36/50). No effect of benzyl alcohol on body weight gain in rats or mice was observed. In the third month of the studies, clinical signs of sialodacryoadenitis virus infection were observed in rats. A positive serologic reaction for rat coronavirus was observed in sentinel animals at 6 months and again at 18 months. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: No apparent compound-related nonneoplastic responses were observed. Dose-related negative trends in the incidences of anterior pituitary gland neoplasms were seen in female rats (vehicle control, 29/50; low dose, 17/47; high dose, 9/49) and of harderian gland adenomas in male mice (8/50; 3/50; 2/50). Adenomas of the adrenal cortex occurred at an increased incidence in high dose male mice (0/48; 0/44; 3/48), but this slight increase was not considered to be related to chemical expcal exposure. Genetic Toxicology: Benzyl alcohol was not mutagenic when tested by the preincubational protocol in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537. In the mouse L5178Y/TK&plusmn; lymphoma assay, benzyl alcohol induced an increase in trifluorothymidine (Tft)-resistant cells in the absence, but not in the presence, of S9; the effect was associated with toxicity. In cytogenetic assays with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, treatment with benzyl alcohol produced an increase in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) which was judged to be equivocal both with and without S9; a significant increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed after exposure to benzyl alcohol in the presence, but not the absence, of S9. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of benzyl alcohol have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female F344/N rats dosed with 200 or 400 mg/kg. Survival in both dose groups of female rats was 50&percnt; that of vehicle controls, primarily due to an increased number of gavage-related deaths. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of benzyl alcohol for male or female B6C3F1 mice dosed with 100 or 200 mg/kg for 2 years.

rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine coronavirus	19638499	Host-pathogen interactions during coronavirus infection of primary alveolar epithelial cells.	"Viruses that infect the lung are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in animals and humans worldwide. Coronaviruses are being associated increasingly with severe diseases in the lower respiratory tract. Alveolar epithelial cells are an important target for coronavirus infection in the lung, and infected cells can initiate innate immune responses to viral infection. In this overview, we describe in vitro models of highly differentiated alveolar epithelial cells that are currently being used to study the innate immune response to coronavirus infection. We have shown that rat coronavirus infection of rat alveolar type I epithelial cells in vitro induces expression of CXC chemokines, which may recruit and activate neutrophils. Although neutrophils are recruited early in infection in several coronavirus models including rat coronavirus. However, their role in viral clearance and/or immune-mediated tissue damage is not understood. Primary cultures of differentiated alveolar epithelial cells will be useful for identifying the interactions between coronaviruses and alveolar epithelial cells that influence the innate immune responses to infection in the lung. Understanding the molecular details of these interactions will be critical for the design of effective strategies to prevent and treat coronavirus infections in the lung."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	1954909	Basal and thyroid hormone receptor auxiliary protein-enhanced binding of thyroid hormone receptor isoforms to native thyroid hormone response elements.	"There are three known isoforms of the rat thyroid hormone receptor, TR alpha-1, TR beta-1, and TR beta-2. The first two are expressed in all tissues, whereas TR beta-2 appears to be expressed only in the pituitary. The differences in the roles of the three receptor isoforms are unknown, but may involve preferential interaction with different subsets of thyroid hormone-regulated genes in different tissues. We tested the binding of the three TR isoforms to putative thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) from genes that are expressed in the pituitary or other tissues and are regulated by thyroid hormone. In vitro translated 35S-labeled rat TR alpha-1, rat TR beta-2, and human TR beta-1 receptors were bound to a battery of biotinylated synthetic deoxyribonucleotides containing naturally occurring putative TREs from genes expressed either in only pituitary (rat glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit, TSH beta-subunit, and GH) or in nonpituitary (rat alpha-myosin heavy chain, malic enzyme, and Moloney murine leukemia virus promoter) tissues. All three receptor forms bound to each of the TREs. TR beta-2 did not show preferential binding to TREs of pituitary-specific genes compared to TR beta-1. Additionally, TR alpha-1 had a similar TRE-binding pattern as the TR beta s, except for possibly less binding to rat glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit TRE. Finally, rat pituitary and liver nuclear extracts enhanced TR binding to TREs, with the greatest enhancement seen with the alpha-subunit TRE. These studies suggest that all TR isoforms bind similarly to native TREs. Also, TR binding to TREs can be differentially enhanced by interactions with nuclear proteins."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	2552446	Provirus insertion in Tpl-1, an Ets-1-related oncogene, is associated with tumor progression in Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced rat thymic lymphomas.	"T-cell lymphomas induced in rats by Moloney murine leukemia virus acquire increasing numbers of proviruses in their genome during tumor progression in vivo and passage of tumor cells in vitro. To determine whether the proviruses progressively acquired during tumor progression play a causal role in this process, we cloned one of them from a cell line derived from the primary tumor 2772. A probe from the cellular DNA flanking the provirus was used to analyze 79 DNA samples from primary tumor tissues of 28 tumor-bearing rats and 80 DNA samples from 30 independent tumor cell lines. This analysis revealed a rearrangement in this region in the primary tumor derived from the thymus of one animal but not in a clone of the same tumor segregating in the spleen. Of the cell line DNA samples, three carried a provirus in this region. Two of these integration events had occurred independently in two clonally related sublines derived from tumor 2772, and they were followed by rapid selection in culture. On the basis of these findings this locus was named Tpl-1 (tumor progression locus 1). The Tpl-1 locus was mapped to rat chromosome 8 and to mouse chromosome 9 at a genetic distance of 1.2 +/- 0.9 centimorgans from the Ets-1 protooncogene. Although the genetic distance between Tpl-1 and Ets-1 indicates that they are different genes, analysis of Tpl-1 cDNA clones revealed that the two are closely related."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	6088084	Transformation mediated by the SV40 T antigens: separation of the overlapping SV40 early genes with a retroviral vector.	"A murine retroviral vector has been used to separate physically the overlapping genes encoded by SV40. This minimal retroviral vector contains LTRs and other cis-acting signals required for infectious RNA virus propagation. We placed the SV40 early region within this DNA and after transfection of cells producing helper Moloney murine leukemia virus, SV40 retroviruses (MV40) could be rescued. Cytoplasmic spliced large T and small t transcripts, as well as unspliced transcripts, are packaged into virions with equal efficiency. Pure SV40 large T retroviruses can be cloned from these heterogeneous virus stocks by secondary transformation of rodent cells. The large T retrovirus stocks morphologically transform primary or established mouse and rat lines with high efficiency. There is little difference in transformation either by agar assay or focus formation between retroviruses carrying both SV40 genes or large T alone. We present quantitative data that demonstrate that abortive transformation of rodent cells by SV40, transient expression of the transformed phenotype after infection, is not manifested by MV40. Thus abortive transformation is not the result of a weakly dominant transforming gene, but rather of the normally inefficient mode of integration and early gene expression of SV40 upon infection of rodent cells."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	7666541	An internal ribosomal entry signal in the rat VL30 region of the Harvey murine sarcoma virus leader and its use in dicistronic retroviral vectors.	"The genetic organization of the 5' genomic RNA domain of the highly oncogenic Harvey murine sarcoma virus appears to be unusual in that a multifunctional untranslated leader precedes the v-ras oncogene. This 5' leader is 1,076 nucleotides in length and is formed of independent regions involved in key steps of the viral life cycle: (i) the Moloney murine leukemia virus 5' repeat, untranslated 5' region, and primer binding site sequences necessary for the first steps of proviral DNA synthesis, (ii) the virus-like 30S (VL30)-derived sequence containing a functional dimerization-packaging signal (E/DLS) directing viral RNA dimerization and packaging into MLV virions, and (iii) an Alu-like sequence preceding the 5' untranslated sequence of v-rasH which contains the initiation codon of the p21ras oncoprotein. These functional features, the unusual length of this leader (1,076 nucleotides), and the presence of stable secondary structures between the cap and the v-ras initiation codon might well cause a premature stop of the scanning ribosomes and thus inhibit v-ras translation. In order to understand how Harvey murine sarcoma virus achieves a high level of expression of the ras oncogene, we asked whether the rat VL30 sequence, 5' to v-ras, could contribute to an efficient synthesis of the ras oncoprotein. The implications of the VL30 sequence in the translation initiation of Ha-ras were investigated in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and in murine cells. Results show that the rat VL30 sequence allows a cap-independent translation of a downstream reporter gene both in vitro and in murine cells. Additional experiments performed with dicistronic neo.VL30.lacZ mRNAs indicate that the 5' VL30 sequence (positions 380 to 794) contains an internal ribosomal entry signal. This finding led us to construct a new dicistronic retroviral vector with which the rat VL30 sequence was able to direct the efficient expression of a 3' cistron and packaging of recombinant dicistronic RNA into murine leukemia virus virions."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	9123877	Variable transduction efficiency of murine leukemia retroviral vector on mammalian cells: role of cellular glycosylation.	"To elucidate the cellular tropism of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV), we have studied the transduction efficiency of a recombinant MuLV vector carrying the beta-galactosidase reporter gene on a variety of rodent cells. Under optimal conditions for in vitro cell transduction, primary cultures of adult rat fibroblasts derived from various organs were very poorly transduced by the ecotropic MuLV vector (0.02-0.12%) when compared to immortalized cells such as the F2408 (42%) and 3Y1 (defined as 100%) lines. Primary cultures of fibroblasts from neonatal (3.7%) or embryonic rat tissues (4.6%) and primary cultures of rat mammary epithelial cells (3-4%) were somewhat more susceptible. Immortalization of rodent fibroblasts with Polyomavirus Large T. SV40 Large T, and E6-E7 genes of human papilloma virus resulted in a modest or minimal increase in transduction efficiency, and introduction of the transforming genes v-Src, v-Ras, and v-Raf was in most instances associated with a decrease in MuLV vector entry. Variability of transduction efficiency was not related to differences in cellular growth rate and treatment of MuLV vectors in vitro with deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and treatment of cells in culture with protease inhibitors failed to modify cellular entry of the MuLV vector. On the other hand, inhibition of cellular glycosylation with swansonine, 1-deoxymannojirimycin and, primarily, tunicamycin enhanced entry of the ecotropic vector by up to 220-fold, particularly into cells which were otherwise highly resistant. These findings demonstrate major differences in transduction efficiency of the ecotropic MuLV vector on rodent cells and indicate that cellular glycosylation plays a critical role in determining MuLV cellular tropism."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	murine leukemia virus	9501051	Differential behavior of the Mo + PyF101 enhancer variant of Moloney murine leukemia virus in rats and mice.	"The Mo + PyF101 enhancer variant of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) has been very useful in investigating M-MuLV leukemogenesis. When inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) into neonatal mice, Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV is attenuated for development of disease. Previous studies in mice infected with wild-type M-MuLV have revealed several important preleukemic events, including development of splenic hyperplasia, defects in bone marrow hematopoiesis, and in vivo generation of MCF viruses that arise by recombination in the uninfected mouse. Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV is defective in inducing these effects after s.c. inoculation. In the experiments reported here, a study of Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV infection in rats was carried out. Wild-type M-MuLV is leukemogenic in rats, but infected rats do not form MCF recombinants since they lack the necessary endogenous polytropic envelope sequences. Since Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV's leukemogenic defect is correlated with a failure to generate MCF recombinants, it seemed possible that wild-type M-MuLV might not have a leukemogenic advantage over Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV in rats, where MCF recombinants cannot form. Neonatal Fisher F344 rats were inoculated s.c. or intraperitoneally by wild-type and Mo + PyF101 M-MuLVs. Surprisingly, Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV was completely deficient in leukemogenesis in rats when inoculated by either route while wild-type M-MuLV induced lymphoma with the predicted time course. The leukemogenic defect for Mo + PyF101 M-MuLV resulted from a pronounced defect for establishing infection in rats. Further studies of wild-type M-MuLV in rats indicated that infection was confined almost exclusively to the thymus at early times. In mice wild-type M-MuLV establishes substantial infection in other hematopoietic organs such as spleen and bone marrow as well. Thymic infection was also correlated with a decrease in thymic cellularity at early times."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	norwalk virus	19773133	Zoonotic aspects of infections with noroviruses and sapoviruses.	"The close genetic relationship of noroviruses and sapoviruses found in animals and humans has raised the question whether these viruses have a zoonotic potential. Transmission from animals to humans and vice versa would have far-reaching consequences for epidemiology and food safety. So far animal noro- and sapoviruses have not been found in humans. However detection of human noroviruses in animals as well as simultaneous presence of animal and human viruses in bivalve molluscs suggest a risk of transmission. Furthermore, antibodies against animal noroviruses were detected in humans as well as antibodies against human noroviruses in swine. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic calves and pigs with human noroviruses demonstrated that virus replication and seroconversion can occur. Accordingly the possible role of noro- and sapoviruses as zoonotic agents needs to be further investigated."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	orthohepevirus a	16242219	The effect of antigen targeting sequences on antibody responses to hepatitis E virus DNA vaccines in rats and sheep.	"Expression of the capsid (PORF2) protein of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in mammalian cells results in heterogeneous intracellular processing with a mixture of stable and rapidly degraded forms, which might be expected to influence immune responses to DNA immunisation. Plasmids encoding the N-terminal 22 or 50 amino acids of PORF2 (Sig1 or Sig3, respectively) fused at the N-terminus of the ORF2.1 antigen of HEV (amino acids 394-660 of PORF2) were examined for processing in vitro and antibody responses in vivo, in both rats and sheep. Unmodified ORF2.1 is an unstable cytosolic protein and Sig1-ORF2.1 is a stable membrane-associated protein, whereas Sig3-ORF2.1 demonstrated heterogeneous processing analogous to that of full-length PORF2. After DNA immunisation, Sig1-ORF2.1 demonstrated a 30-fold enhancement of antibody responses in rats compared to untargeted ORF2.1, increasing to more than 200-fold after boosting with recombinant protein, but was ineffective in sheep. In contrast, Sig3-ORF2.1 did not give a significant effect in rats, but demonstrated 4-5-fold enhancement of antibody responses in sheep, and this enhancement was maintained after boosting with recombinant protein. These results suggest that Sig3 in particular may have promise as a targeting molecule for DNA vaccines in large animals."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	orthohepevirus a	21998412	Restricted enzooticity of hepatitis E virus genotypes 1 to 4 in the United States.	"Hepatitis E is recognized as a zoonosis, and swine are known reservoirs, but how broadly enzootic its causative agent, hepatitis E virus (HEV), is remains controversial. To determine the prevalence of HEV infection in animals, a serological assay with capability to detect anti-HEV-antibody across a wide variety of animal species was devised. Recombinant antigens comprising truncated capsid proteins generated from HEV-subgenomic constructs that represent all four viral genotypes were used to capture anti-HEV in the test sample and as an analyte reporter. To facilitate development and validation of the assay, serum samples were assembled from blood donors (n = 372), acute hepatitis E patients (n = 94), five laboratory animals (rhesus monkey, pig, New Zealand rabbit, Wistar rat, and BALB/c mouse) immunized with HEV antigens, and four pigs experimentally infected with HEV. The assay was then applied to 4,936 sera collected from 35 genera of animals that were wild, feral, domesticated, or otherwise held captive in the United States. Test positivity was determined in 457 samples (9.3%). These originated from: bison (3/65, 4.6%), cattle (174/1,156, 15%), dogs (2/212, 0.9%), Norway rats (2/318, 0.6%), farmed swine (267/648, 41.2%), and feral swine (9/306, 2.9%). Only the porcine samples yielded the highest reactivities. HEV RNA was amplified from one farmed pig and two feral pigs and characterized by nucleotide sequencing to belong to genotype 3. HEV infected farmed swine primarily, and the role of other animals as reservoirs of its zoonotic spread appears to be limited."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	orthohepevirus a	22248641	Coronavirus infection of rat dorsal root ganglia: ultrastructural characterization of viral replication, transfer, and the early response of satellite cells.	"Swine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) has been shown to have a capability to gain access to the cell bodies of sensory neurons after peripheral inoculation, resulting in ganglionic infection. It is not clearly understood how this virus is replicated within and released from the sensory neurons, and it remains to know how satellite cells response to the HEV invasion. By ultrastructurally examining HEV-infected rat dorsal root ganglia, we found that HEV in the cell bodies of infected neurons budded from endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments, and were assembled either individually within small vesicles or in groups within large vesicles. The progeny virions were released from the sensory neurons mainly by smooth-surfaced vesicle-mediated secretory pathway, which occurred predominantly at the perikaryal projections and infoldings of sensory neurons. Released HEV particles were subsequently taken up by the adjacent satellite cells. Almost all virus particles in the cytoplasm of satellite cells were contained in groups within vesicles and lysosome-like structures, suggesting that these glial cells may restrict the local diffusion of HEV. These observations give some insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection and are thought to help understand the interactions between sensory neurons and their satellite cells."	0

rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	rodent protoparvovirus 2	9525656	Rat parvovirus type 1: the prototype for a new rodent parvovirus serogroup.	"A newly recognized parvovirus of laboratory rats, designated rat parvovirus type 1a (RPV-1a), was found to be antigenically distinct. It was cloned, sequenced, and compared with the University of Massachusetts strain of rat virus (RV-UMass) and other autonomous parvoviruses. RPV-1a VP1 identity with these viruses never exceeded 69%, thus explaining its antigenic divergence. In addition, RPV-1a had reduced amino acid identity in NS coding regions (82%), reflecting phylogenetic divergence from other rodent parvoviruses. RPV-1a infection in rats had a predilection for endothelium and lymphoid tissues as previously reported for RV. Infectious RPV-1a was isolated 3 weeks after inoculation of infant rats, suggesting that it, like RV, may result in persistent infection. In contrast to RV, RPV-1a was enterotropic, a characteristic previously associated with parvovirus infections of mice rather than rats. RPV-1a also differed from RV in that infection was nonpathogenic for infant rats under conditions where RV infection causes high morbidity and mortality. Thus, RPV-1a is the prototype virus of an antigenically, genetically, and biologically distinct rodent parvovirus serogroup."	0

rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	rosavirus a	25316698	Detection of zoonotic pathogens and characterization of novel viruses carried by commensal Rattus norvegicus in New York City.	"Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) are globally distributed and concentrate in urban environments, where they live and feed in closer proximity to human populations than most other mammals. Despite the potential role of rats as reservoirs of zoonotic diseases, the microbial diversity present in urban rat populations remains unexplored. In this study, we used targeted molecular assays to detect known bacterial, viral, and protozoan human pathogens and unbiased high-throughput sequencing to identify novel viruses related to agents of human disease in commensal Norway rats in New York City. We found that these rats are infected with bacterial pathogens known to cause acute or mild gastroenteritis in people, including atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, Clostridium difficile, and Salmonella enterica, as well as infectious agents that have been associated with undifferentiated febrile illnesses, including Bartonella spp., Streptobacillus moniliformis, Leptospira interrogans, and Seoul hantavirus. We also identified a wide range of known and novel viruses from groups that contain important human pathogens, including sapoviruses, cardioviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rotaviruses, and hepaciviruses. The two novel hepaciviruses discovered in this study replicate in the liver of Norway rats and may have utility in establishing a small animal model of human hepatitis C virus infection. The results of this study demonstrate the diversity of microbes carried by commensal rodent species and highlight the need for improved pathogen surveillance and disease monitoring in urban environments. Importance: The observation that most emerging infectious diseases of humans originate in animal reservoirs has led to wide-scale microbial surveillance and discovery programs in wildlife, particularly in the developing world. Strikingly, less attention has been focused on commensal animals like rats, despite their abundance in urban centers and close proximity to human populations. To begin to explore the zoonotic disease risk posed by urban rat populations, we trapped and surveyed Norway rats collected in New York City over a 1-year period. This analysis revealed a striking diversity of known pathogens and novel viruses in our study population, including multiple agents associated with acute gastroenteritis or febrile illnesses in people. Our findings indicate that urban rats are reservoirs for a vast diversity of microbes that may affect human health and indicate a need for increased surveillance and awareness of the disease risks associated with urban rodent infestation."	0

rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	seoul orthohantavirus	10933735	Sex differences in Seoul virus infection are not related to adult sex steroid concentrations in Norway rats.	"Field studies of hantavirus infection in rodents report that a higher percentage of infected individuals are males than females. To determine whether males were more susceptible to hantavirus infection than females, adult male and female Long Evans rats (Rattus norvegicus) were inoculated with doses of Seoul virus ranging from 10(-4) to 10(6) PFU. The 50% infective doses (ID(50)) were not significantly different for male and female rats (10(0.05) and 10(0.8) PFU, respectively). To determine whether sex differences in response to infection were related to circulating sex steroid hormones, sex steroid concentrations were manipulated and antibody responses and virus shedding were assessed following inoculation with the ID(90). Regardless of hormone treatment, males had higher anti-Seoul virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgG2a (i.e., Th1) responses than females and IgG1 (i.e., Th2) responses similar to those of females. Males also shed virus in saliva and feces longer than females. Manipulation of sex steroids in adulthood did not alter immune responses or virus shedding, suggesting that sex steroids may organize adult responses to hantavirus earlier during ontogeny."	0

Male and female Long Evans rats (Rattus norvegicus) were inoculated with Seoul virus, and antibody and cytokine responses, as well as virus shedding were assessed. Males were more likely to shed virus in saliva, to shed virus through multiple routes (saliva, urine, and feces), and to have viral RNA in the spleen than females. Anti-Seoul virus IgG responses were higher in males than females. In both sexes, splenic IFNgamma and IL-4 production increased following infection. After infection, males had higher Th1 immune responses (i.e., IgG2a, IFNgamma, and IL-2) than females; in contrast, Th2 immune responses (i.e., IgG1, IL-4, and IL-10) were similar between the sexes. These data suggest that immune responses to Seoul virus differ between the sexes."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	seoul orthohantavirus	15221534	Persistent Seoul virus infection in Lewis rats.	"Mechanistic studies of hantavirus persistence in rodent reservoirs have been limited by the lack of a versatile animal model. This report describes findings from experimental infection of inbred Lewis rats with Seoul virus strain 80-39. Rats inoculated with virus intraperitoneally at 6 days of age became persistently infected without clinical signs. Tissues from Seoul virus-inoculated 6-day-old rats were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 weeks post-inoculation for viral RNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) and for infectious virus by inoculation of Vero E6 cells. Virus was isolated from lung and kidney of infected rats at 6 weeks and viral RNA was detected in lung, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, brain, spleen, liver and skin at 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Rats inoculated with Seoul virus intraperitoneally at 10 or 21 days of age became infected without clinical signs but had low to undetectable levels of viral RNA in tissues at 6 weeks post-inoculation. ISH identified vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells as common sites of persistent infection. Cultured rat smooth muscle cells and to a lesser extent cultured endothelial cells also were susceptible to Seoul virus infection. Pancreatic infection resulted in insulitis with associated hyperglycemia. These studies demonstrate that infant Lewis rats are uniformly susceptible to asymptomatic persistent Seoul virus infection. Additionally, they offer opportunities for correlative in vivo and in vitro study of Seoul virus interactions in host cell types that support persistent infection."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	seoul orthohantavirus	18461618	Seoul virus enhances regulatory and reduces proinflammatory responses in male Norway rats.	"Zoonotic pathogens, including hantaviruses, are maintained in the environment by causing persistent infection in the absence of disease in their reservoir hosts. Spillover of hantaviruses to humans can cause severe disease that is mediated by excessive proinflammatory responses. The mechanisms mediating hantaviral persistence in rodent reservoirs remain largely unknown. Male Norway rats were inoculated with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), and viral RNA, cytokine, and chemokine responses were evaluated in spleen and lung tissue. More viral RNA was detectable in the lungs than spleen, with copies of SEOV peaking 15-30 days post-inoculation (p.i.) and persisting for 60 days p.i. In the lungs, the expression and production of proinflammatory mediators (i.e., IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL5, CCL2, CX3CL1, CXCL10, VCAM, VEGF, and NOS2) remained at or below baseline throughout SEOV infection; whereas, regulatory factors, including TGF-beta and FoxP3 were elevated. Conversely, in the spleen, proinflammatory responses were induced while regulatory responses remained unchanged during infection. To determine whether reduced proinflammatory responses mediate hantavirus persistence in the lungs, male rats were administered rIL-1beta or vehicle for 30 days during SEOV infection. SEOV persistence and shedding were not affected by IL-1beta treatment. Proinflammatory responses were elevated in rIL-1beta-treated rats, but remained within physiological levels, suggesting that supra-physiological concentrations may be necessary for viral clearance at the cost of causing disease. Elevated regulatory responses may suppress excessively high proinflammatory responses at a site of elevated SEOV replication to contribute to viral persistence and prevent proinflammatory-mediated disease in reservoir hosts."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	seoul orthohantavirus	18931068	Corticosteroids modulate Seoul virus infection, regulatory T-cell responses and matrix metalloprotease 9 expression in male, but not female, Norway rats.	"Human hantaviral disease is mediated by excessive proinflammatory and CD8+ T-cell responses, which can be alleviated by administration of corticosteroids. In contrast with humans, male rats that are infected with their species-specific hantavirus, Seoul virus (SEOV), have reduced proinflammatory and elevated regulatory T-cell responses in tissues where virus persists. To determine the effects of glucocorticoids on SEOV persistence and immune responses during infection, male and female Norway rats received sham surgeries (sham) or were adrenalectomized (ADX0), in some of which corticosterone was replaced at low (ADX10) or high (ADX80) doses. Rats were inoculated with SEOV and serum corticosterone, SEOV RNA, gene expression and protein production were measured at different time points post-inoculation. We observed that SEOV infection suppressed corticosterone in sham males to concentrations seen in ADX0 males. Furthermore, males with low corticosterone had more SEOV RNA in the lungs than either females or males with high corticosterone concentrations during peak infection. Although high concentrations of corticosterone suppressed the expression of innate antiviral and proinflammatory mediators to a greater extent in females than in males, these immunomodulatory effects did not correlate with SEOV load. Males with low corticosterone concentrations and high viral load had elevated regulatory T-cell responses and expression of matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-9. MMP-9 is a glycogenase that disrupts cellular matrices and may facilitate extravasation of SEOV-infected cells from circulation into lung tissue. Suppression of glucocorticoids may thus contribute to more efficient dissemination of SEOV in male than in female rats."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	seoul orthohantavirus	20193387	[Comparison on the difference of virulence between Hantaan virus and Seoul virus isolated both from Rattus norvegicus].	"Comparing the difference of virulence between the strain CGRn5310 (HTNV) and the strain HR54 (SEOV) isolated both from Rattus norvegicus., Suckling mice were used to compare the difference of virulence between the two strains. Hantavirus antigens were detected in brain and lung tissues collected from the infected mice., Compared with the control group, all infected mice grew slowly. Furthermore, the mice inoculated intracerebrally with either CGRn5310 or HR45 appeared ruffled fur, and reduced activity, followed by neurological symptoms, such as paralyses and convulsions. The half lethal dose (LD(50)) of CGRn5310 strain was 10(-6.42), whereas the LD(50) of HR54 strain was 10(-4.51). Hantavirus antigens were identified in brain and lung tissues from the mice infected with the strain CGRn5310 and the strain HR54., LD(50) of the strain CGRn5310 was significantly higher than that of the strain HR54. Our results suggested that the virulence of the spillover hantavirus might only slightly be influenced by the non-reservoir rodents."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	seoul orthohantavirus	21937858	Application of truncated nucleocapsid protein (N) for serotyping ELISA of murinae-associated hantavirus infection in rats.	"Truncated recombinant nucleocapsid proteins (trNs) that lack N-terminally located cross-reactive epitopes of four Murinae rodent-associated hantaviruses, Seoul virus (SEOV), Thailand virus, Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Dobrava-Belgrade virus, were produced by using a baculovirus expression system. ELISA with the trNs as antigens enabled serotyping of immune sera from rats experimentally inoculated with the corresponding hantaviruses with cut-off OD values of 60% of those of whole N of HTNV. The trN-based ELISA could serotype 12 out of 13 sera obtained from wild rodents (Rattus norvegicus) naturally infected with SEOV using the 60% cut-off value. These results indicate that screening with whole N followed by serotyping with trNs using a cut-off OD value of 60% of that of whole N is a useful method for serological surveillance of Murinae-associated hantavirus infection among rodents."	0
rattus norvegicus	Rodentia	tick-borne encephalitis virus	10072153	Isolation of tick-borne encephalitis virus from wild rodents and a seroepizootiologic survey in Hokkaido, Japan.	"To determine the vertebrate host of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus in the southern part of Hokkaido, Japan, virus isolation was performed using spleens from small mammals captured in the area. Two virus strains were isolated, one strain from Apodemus speciosus and another from Clethrionomys rufocanus. Virus isolates were inoculated onto baby hamster kidney cell monolayers and antigen slides were prepared for an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay. Two isolates were identified as TBE viruses by monoclonal antibody reactions. To specify the TBE-endemic area in Hokkaido, rodent, horse, and dog sera collected from 1992 to 1997 were tested for neutralization antibody against TBE virus previously isolated from a dog. The positive cases were distributed in four districts in the southern part of Hokkaido."	0

Experimental Infection of Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) with West Nile Virus. American Journal of Tropical Medical Hygiene 2008 79:447-451.	"Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) have shown high West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence, and WNV infection has been suggested as a cause of morbidity and mortality in this species. We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean viremias of 10(5.1) and 10(4.8) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on days 3 and 4 post-infection (DPI) and estimated that approximately 2.1% of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1-5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities. The low viremias and lack of mortality observed in S. carolinensis suggest that they may be useful as sentinels of spillover from the enzootic amplification cycle."	0
rattus rattus	Rodentia	hantaan orthohantavirus	6127366	Isolation of Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever, from wild urban rats.	"Urban rats captured in Seoul and four nearby Korean cities were found to have immunofluorescent antibodies reactive with Hantaan virus, the etiologic agent of Korean hemorrhagic fever (KHF). Serum antibodies were detected in 13% from 477 Rattus norvegicus and 11% of 47 Rattus rattus. Hantaan viral antigen was found in pulmonary tissues of 42 animals, and Hantaan virus was recovered from 23 rats, all but two of which were R. norvegicus. Wistar rats were qualitatively much more sensitive than Apodemus agrarius rodents for isolation of virus from tissues of wild rats. Wistar rats inoculated with one of these strains had virus in lung and spleen for at least 75 days. These results document the existence of an urban cycle for Hantaan virus, which had been suspected on the basis of the occurrence of sporadic urban cases in humans of KHF, and suggest that Rattus-borne Hantaan virus may be widely distributed in urban centers."	0
rattus rattus	Rodentia	murid betaherpesvirus 2	16737550	Pathogenesis and vertical transmission of a transplacental rat cytomegalovirus.	"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) congenital infection is the major viral cause of well-documented birth defects in human. Because CMV is species-specific, the main obstacle to developing animal models for congenital infection is the difference in placental architecture, which preludes virus transmission across the placenta. The rat placenta, resembling histologically to that of human, could therefore facilitate the study of CMV congenital infection in human., In this report, we present clear evidences of the transplacental property of a new rat CMV (RCMV), namely ALL-03, which had been isolated from placenta and uterus of the house rat. Our study signifies the detection of infectious virus, virus particles, viral protein and DNA as well as immune response to demonstrate a natural model of acute CMV infection including the immunocompetent and immunocompromised host associated with or without pregnancy. It is characterized by a full range of CMV related clinical signs; lesions and anatomical virus distribution to uterus, placenta, embryo, fetus, neonate, lung, kidney, spleen, liver and salivary gland of the infected rats in addition to the virus-specific seroconversion. The preference of the virus for different organs mimics the situation in immunocompromised man. Most interestingly, the placenta was observed to be involved in the maternofetal infection and hence confirmed the hypothesis that the RCMV strain ALL-03 is capable to cross the placenta and infect the offsprings congenitally., The maternal viremia leading to uterine infection which subsequently infecting to the fetus through the placenta is the most likely phenomenon of CMV vertical transmission in our study."	0
rattus rattus	Rodentia	orthohepevirus a	11380801	Prevalence of anti-hepatitis E virus antibodies in different Indian animal species.	"Prevalence of IgG antibodies to hepatitis E virus (IgG-anti-HEV) was determined among different animal species from India. Seropositivity varied from 4.4% to 6.9% in cattle, 54.6-74.4% in pigs and 2.1-21.5% in rodents. Of the 44 dogs screened, 10 were positive (22.7%). None of the 250 goat sera tested were found to be anti-HEV positive. Among rodents, over 50% serum samples collected in 1985 from Bandicota bengalensis were positive for anti-HEV antibodies. No evidence of HEV infection was obtained following experimental inoculation of an Indian strain (AKL-90) of HEV into anti-HEV negative pigs and goats. The results document varied prevalence of anti-HEV antibodies in different animal species from India and of inability of Indian pigs and goats to support replication of at least one human strain of HEV."	0
rattus rattus	Rodentia	rift valley fever phlebovirus	10817634	The potential role of rodents in the enzootic cycle of Rift Valley fever virus in Senegal.	"Wild rodents (214) of fourteen species were trapped at seven sites in Senegal. Arvicanthis niloticus and Mastomys erythroleucus were among the most frequently collected species (77.2% of total capture). All rodents were examined for the presence of anti-Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibody; the prevalence over all sampled species was 3.8%, varying widely with respect to species and location. Four of 14 species of rodents were found to have anti-RVFV antibodies: Rattus rattus (one positive of two tested) Mastomys huberti (13.5%), A. niloticus (4.3%), and M. erthroleucus (2.4%). The highest prevalence of anti-RVFV antibody was recorded within the enzootic area of the Senegal River delta, at Richard Toll (9.6%). A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus and a strain of laboratory-bred mice were experimentally inoculated with two strains of RVFV and examined for viremia, illness, seroconversion and mortality. A. niloticus and M. erythroleucus demonstrated a limited resistance to infection, thus potentially allowing for the replication of virus in these animals and making these species possible candidates as hosts in the maintenance cycle of RVFV in nature."	0

Journal of clinical microbiology 33:1699-1703.	"H-1 virus and Kilham rat virus (KRV) are autonomous parvoviruses which generally cause subclinical infections in rats and can cause persistent infections in cell cultures. In this study, primer sets specific for either H-1 or KRV were designed on the basis of DNA sequence comparisons of the rodent parvoviruses. The specificities of the H-1 and KRV-specific primer sets were determined by testing viral preparations of seven different parvoviruses and nine other viruses known to infect rodents. The H-1-specific PCR assay amplified the expected 254-bp product only in the presence of H-1 viral DNA and was able to detect as little as 100 fg of H-1 viral DNA. The KRV-specific PCR assay generated the expected 281-bp product only when KRV viral DNA was used as the template and was able to detect as little as 10 pg of KRV viral DNA. Each assay was able to detect its respective virus in tissues from rats experimentally infected with H-1 or KRV. In contrast, no product was amplified by either assay with tissues from mock-infected rats. Our findings indicate that these PCR assays provide rapid, specific, and sensitive methods for the detection of H-1 or KRV infection in rats and cell culture systems."	0

American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene 31:1273-1284.	"In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, feces, etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared. Biologic properties were defined by infectivity titrations in suckling mice and Vero, LLC-MK2, and primary Pekin duck embryo cells, and antigenic relationships were defined by complement-fixation and plaque reduction neutralization tests. An antigenic classification scheme is proposed. Antigenic and biologic properties delimit two large clusters. The first, comprising a single antigenic complex, includes those which have yet to be isolated from arthropods, but are likely to be so (Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Koutango, Negishi and Aroa viruses). The second, encompassing five antigenic complexes, is comprised of viruses which have been isolated exclusively from rodents or bats (Saboya, Carey Island, Dakar bat, Sokuluk, Bukalasa bat, Entebbe bat, Phnom Penh bat, Modoc, Sal Vieja, Jutiapa, San Perlita, Cowbone Ridge, Rio Bravo, Apoi, Tamana bat and Montana Myotis leucoencephalitis viruses) but includes three viruses (Saboya, Sokuluk and Entebbe bat viruses) which may be arthropod-borne, as indicated by replication in mosquito cells in vitro."	0

The Journal of general virology 68 ( Pt 5):1299-1306.	"Reassortment is an important factor in the evolution of segmented genome viruses. For arthropod-borne viruses it is important to determine whether the vertebrate host acts as a site of reassortant virus formation since vertebrates often act as amplifying hosts. Mutants of Thogoto virus, a tick-borne orthomyxo-like virus, were shown to produce wild-type progeny in a dually infected permissive host (hamster), when hamsters were infected with two mutant viruses either by direct inoculation or by oral transmission from infected ticks. Viral dose and time of co-infection of the host affected the incidence of reassortment. This is the first report of reassortment of an arbovirus following infection of a vertebrate host via an arthropod vector."	0
rhabdomys pumilio	Rodentia	hepacivirus c	23818848	Evidence for novel hepaciviruses in rodents.	"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is among the most relevant causes of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%). Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV. "	0
rhinolophus hipposideros	Chiroptera	rotavirus a	24027312	Characterization of a novel G3P[3] rotavirus isolated from a lesser horseshoe bat: a distant relative of feline/canine rotaviruses.	"Bats are considered important animal reservoirs for many viruses pathogenic to humans. An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 × 10² 50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population."	0

Identification And Study Of A Poxvirus Isolated From Wild Rodents In Turkmenia. Archives of Virology 56:7-14.	"A new poxvirus was isolated in 1974 from the kidney of a wild big gerbil (Rhombomys opimus) caught in Turkmenia, where these gerbils are wide-spread. The virus resembles cowpox virus and is markedly different from the virus of infectious ectromelia, the best-known poxvirus of rodents. The new virus is apparently identical to other poxvirus isolates made from white rats and Felidae in the Moscow Zoo. Experimental inoculation of the natural hosts--big gerbils and yellow susliks (Citellus fulvus)--produced a severe infection with a high mortality rate. Trnasmission of virus to uninoculated cage mates was shown to occur. Virus persisted in convalescent animals and was present in urine 3 weeks after inoculation and in kidney and testis for at least 5 weeks after inoculation. The role of rodents as natural hosts of poxviruses is discussed."	0
rhombomys opimus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	225049	Field and experimental studies of poxvirus infections in rodents.	"Data are presented from serological and virological investigations of natural and experimental infections, in rodents, with different poxviruses. The demonstration of poxvirus antibodies (virus neutralizing antibodies, antihaemagglutinins, and precipitins) in the kidneys and/or lungs of rodents from Europe and Africa, and the isolation of poxviruses from them, all indicate that rodents may be poxvirus carriers. Isolates from rodents differed in their properties. Some, from Turkmenistan rodents or from white rats caught near Moscow, appeared to be very close to cowpox virus, while others (from Zaire rodents) were identical to variola-like (whitepox) viruses found earlier in monkeys in the same region. The results suggest that rodents that carry the virus closely similar to cowpox virus might be a source of infection for other animal species."	0
rousettus aegyptiacus	Chiroptera	european bat 1 lyssavirus	11043951	Characterisation of a recently isolated lyssavirus in frugivorous zoo bats.	"In July 1997 a lyssavirus was isolated in Denmark from a colony of Egyptian flying foxes (Rousettus aegyptiacus) originating from a Dutch zoo. Sequencing of a 400 nucleotides coding region of the nucleoprotein and of a major part of the G-protein ectodomain encoding region of the newly isolated virus, revealed a very high similarity with European Bat Lyssavirus subtype 1a (EBL-1a). For characterisation of the recently isolated lyssavirus in frugivorous zoo bats, 16 frugivorous bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) of the same colony and 80 mice were experimentally infected with the Rousettus isolate or with a well defined EBL-1a strain isolated from a Dutch insectivorous bat (Eptesicus serotinus). Inoculation viruses were titrated in mice to determine LD50's of both isolates. Clinical signs of inoculated bats were recorded during 6 weeks. After showing neurological signs or at the end of the experimental infection all animals were euthanized. During the experimental infection sera and various tissues of inoculated bats were collected. Immunoassays, mouse inoculation tests (MIT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were employed for detection of lyssavirus specific antibodies, antigen or RNA. Five bats inoculated with the Rousettus isolate and 2 bats inoculated with the Eptesicus isolate showed neurological signs. The remaining 9 bats survived and cleared the virus; at least under the detection limit of the used assays. Despite a much higher pathogenicity of the Rousettus isolate observed in mice, LD25's in bats were quite the same for the 2 isolates. The pathogenicity of both isolates suggested that like many other mammals, Rousettus aegyptiacus bats could be victims of lyssavirus infection besides reservoir hosts of infectious EBL1a. There was no significant difference in detecting the different lyssavirus isolates in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats. An employed immunoperoxidase staining (IP) method was very useful for sensitive detection and localization of lyssavirus antigen in histologic preparates."	0
rousettus aegyptiacus	Chiroptera	european bat 1 lyssavirus	11892688	Presence of European bat lyssavirus RNas in apparently healthy Rousettus aegyptiacus bats.	"Apparently healthy Rousettus aegyptiacus bats were randomly chosen from a Dutch colony naturally infected with European bat lyssavirus subgenotype 1a (EBL1a). These bats were euthanised three months after the first evidence of an EBL1a infection in the colony. EBL1a genomic and antigenomic RNAs of the nucleoprotein gene were detected by nested reverse transcriptase PCR in 75% of the examined Rousettus aegyptiacus bats. The EBL1a RNAs of the nucleoprotein gene were detected mainly in brain tissues, but also in other organs. EBL1a messenger RNAs of the nucleoprotein gene and the glycoprotein gene were detected in brain tissues. The standard fluorescent antibody test revealed the presence of lyssavirus antigens in brain tissues from 7 (17.5%) Rousettus aegyptiacus bats. Furthermore, EBL1a could not be detected by virus isolation on murine neuroblastoma cells or by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice. Neutralising antibodies directed against EBL1 were detected in 11% of the examined bats. This study shows that at least 85% of the apparently healthy Rousettus aegyptiacus bats must have been infected with EBL1a, and that these bats may survive from an EBL1a infection. Furthermore, the study supports the possibility of a long-term maintenance of EBL1a genome in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats."	0

"Six species of rodents from Kern County, California, were inoculated subcutaneously with western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE) virus to determine their susceptibility to infection and their potential as natural hosts. Ammospermophilus nelsoni, Citellus beecheyi, Dipodomys heermanni, Dipodomys nitratoides, Peromyscus maniculatus, and Sciurus griseus were readily infected. Infection was usually fatal in Dipodomys species, C. beecheyi, and S. griseus, but was clinically inapparent in other species. Viremic responses varied greatly in magnitude and duration in different species and with different viral strains. Viremic animals that survived developed high titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody. Hemagglutination-inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies persisted at high titers for at least 8 to 58 weeks after infection, except in P. maniculatus. If animals died during or shortly after the viremic phase of infection, the virus usually was recoverable from numerous organs. Long-term survival of virus could not be demonstrated in A. nelsoni and Dipodomys species. It is concluded that A. nelsoni and P. maniculatus are not important natural hosts of WEE virus; they are susceptible to infection and develop antibodies, but serological surveys of the same species rarely reveal evidence of infection. S. griseus, D. heermanni, D. nitratoides, and possibly C. beecheyi are aberrant hosts of WEE virus since most of them died when infected. Two species of ticks that are ectoparasitic on rodents in Kern County were evaluated as vectors of WEE virus. Dermacentor parumapertus failed to become infected after feeding on viremic hosts, and Ornithodorus parkeri became infected but failed to transmit virus."	0
sciurus niger	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1

Journal of General Virology 84:3337-3341.	"A parapoxvirus has been implicated in the decline of the red squirrel in the United Kingdom. Virus was isolated from an outbreak of lethal disease in red squirrels in the north-east of England. Experimental infection of captive-bred red squirrels confirmed that this virus was the cause of the severe skin lesions observed. Electron microscopic examination of the virus showed that it had a morphology typical of parapoxviruses whilst preliminary sequence data suggested a genomic G+C composition of approximately 66 %, again similar to that found in other parapoxviruses. However Southern hybridization analysis failed to detect three known parapoxvirus genes, two of which have been found so far only in the genus parapoxvirus. Comparative sequence analysis of two other genes, conserved across the eight recognized chordopoxvirus genera, suggests that the squirrel virus represents a previously unrecognized genus of the chordopoxvirus."	0

"In contrast to most of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses, the flaviviruses with undetermined arthropod-borne status are probably disseminated only by direct contact with excreta (saliva, urine, feces, etc.); however, as yet undescribed arthropod transmission cycles may be found for some of them. Twenty-two of these flaviviruses, including prototype and recently isolated strains, were compared.

"A new herpesvirus recovered from the kidneys of mature ground squirrels (Citellus citellus) produced an effect in tissue culture cells resembling that of herpesviruses, including the formation of multinucleated syncytia and type A intranuclear inclusions. The isolate caused latent infection in the natural host, but it proved fatal for intracerebrally inoculated suckling mice and it produced pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane of embryonated eggs. Electron-microscopic examination of infected cells revealed intranuclear virus particles exhibiting a size and ultrastructure characteristic of herpesviruses. The isolate was ether-resistant and a DNA nucleic acid type was inferred from observations on inhibition by fluorinated pyrimidine. This ground squirrel herpesvirus was found to be antigenically distinct from Herpesvirus hominis and from ground squirrel cytomegalovirus, with no detectable cross-reactivity."	0

spermophilus fulvus	Rodentia	cowpox virus	225049	Field and experimental studies of poxvirus infections in rodents.	"Data are presented from serological and virological investigations of natural and experimental infections, in rodents, with different poxviruses. The demonstration of poxvirus antibodies (virus neutralizing antibodies, antihaemagglutinins, and precipitins) in the kidneys and/or lungs of rodents from Europe and Africa, and the isolation of poxviruses from them, all indicate that rodents may be poxvirus carriers. Isolates from rodents differed in their properties. Some, from Turkmenistan rodents or from white rats caught near Moscow, appeared to be very close to cowpox virus, while others (from Zaire rodents) were identical to variola-like (whitepox) viruses found earlier in monkeys in the same region. The results suggest that rodents that carry the virus closely similar to cowpox virus might be a source of infection for other animal species."	0

sturnira lilium	Chiroptera	rabies lyssavirus	21468481	Rabies diagnosis and serology in bats from the State of São Paulo, Brazil.	"Bats are one of the most important reservoirs and vectors of the rabies virus in the world., From 1988 to 2003, the Zoonosis Control Center in São Paulo City performed rabies diagnosis on 5,670 bats by direct immunofluorescent test and mouse inoculation test. Blood samples were collected from 1,618 bats and the sera were analyzed using the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test to confirm rabies antibodies., Forty-four (0.8%) bats were positive for rabies. The prevalence of rabies antibodies was 5.9% using 0.5IU/ml as a cutoff. Insectivorous bats (69.8%) and bats of the species Molossus molossus (51.8%) constituted the majority of the sample; however, the highest prevalence of antibodies were observed in Glossophaga soricina (14/133), Histiotus velatus (16/60), Desmodus rotundus (8/66), Artibeus lituratus (5/54), Nyctinomops macrotis (3/23), Tadarida brasiliensis (3/48), Carollia perspicillata (3/9), Eumops auripendulus (2/30), Nyctinomops laticaudatus (2/16), Sturnira lilium (2/17) and Eumops perotis (1/13). The prevalence of rabies antibodies was analyzed by species, food preference and sex., The expressive levels of antibodies associated with the low virus positivity verified in these bats indicate that rabies virus circulates actively among them."	0
tadarida brasiliensis	Chiroptera	rabies lyssavirus	2681843	Prevalence of rabies specific antibodies in the Mexican free-tailed bat (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) at Lava Cave, New Mexico.	"Adult female and juvenile Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana) were collected bimonthly at Lava Cave, New Mexico from May through September. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of active rabies infection as well as to determine individual immune status in these hosts. All bats were bled and examined for rabies antibody (total antibody versus IgM) utilizing a modified serum neutralization test. The brains were removed and examined by the fluorescent rabies antibody (FRA) test. No significant difference was observed in the number of adults with rabies neutralizing antibody (total) over the study period. Significant differences in rabies neutralizing antibody (total) were observed among the juveniles sampled during July and August. The number of adults with IgM specific antibody was low (15 of 750, 2%) and did not fluctuate significantly. However, the number of juveniles with IgM antibody did show increased levels in August and September. The number of adults positive by the FRA was low (4 of 750, less than 1%) and did not appear to fluctuate significantly over the study period. The number of juveniles positive by the FRA was three and one-half times higher than observed for the adults (14 of 600, 2%). These results indicate that the Mexican free-tailed bat appears to be exposed to rabies virus shortly after birth as evident by its immune status. The low prevalence (4 of 750, less than 1%) of active infection as determined by the FRA and mouse inoculation and the high prevalence (514 of 750, 69%) of IgG antibody in the adult females indicate that the Mexican free-tailed bat recovers from rabies virus infection."	0
tadarida brasiliensis	Chiroptera	west nile virus	16103624	Experimental and natural infection of North American bats with West Nile virus.	"Big brown (Eptesicus fuscus) and Mexican free-tailed (Tadarida brasiliensis) bats were inoculated with the New York 99 strain of West Nile virus to assess their potential to serve as amplifying hosts and determine the clinical effect of infection. Groups of three or four bats were bled at daily intervals between 1 and 6 days after inoculation to determine the pattern of viremia. Beginning 2 days after inoculation, virus was isolated each day from one or more E. fuscus bats, in titers ranging from 10 to 180 plaque-forming units per milliliter of serum. Virus was not isolated from any of the sera collected from T. brasiliensis bats. None of the bats from either species showed clinical signs associated with exposure to virus. Sera from an additional 149 bats collected in Louisiana in 2002 during an epizootic of West Nile fever were tested for antibodies to virus, and two were found to be positive. These data suggest that bats from these two widely distributed species are unlikely to serve as amplifying hosts for West Nile virus."	0
tadarida teniotis	Chiroptera	mammalian orthoreovirus	22931153	Identification of Mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 in Italian bats.	"Summary This study describes the isolation and molecular characterization of Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) in microbats. Faecal samples and dead individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they were morphologically identified as reoviruses by negative staining electron microscopy observation. The definitive assignment of all isolates to MRV was confirmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene. Through a multiplex RT-PCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of 19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416 bp) and complete S1 (1416 bp) sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the three serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D and 419E) were highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identification of MRV type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the need for vigilance."	0
tamias minimus	Rodentia	modoc virus	2987550	Modoc-like virus isolated from wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in Alberta.	"Small mammals were trapped in northeastern Alberta, Canada during 1976. Blood samples from these animals were tested for virus by inoculation of suckling mice. Blood clots from two deer mice yielded isolates of the same virus. The virus was related antigenically to a number of flaviviruses which have been isolated from mammals in Central America and North America and was related most closely to Modoc virus. Physical, chemical, and biological properties of the virus were similar also to those of Modoc virus. It did not produce illness or death in deer mice inoculated in the laboratory. Neutralization tests indicated that 1/38 (3%) red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), 3/35 (9%) least chipmunks (Eutamius minimus), 13/109 (12%) deer mice, and 3/50 (6%) humans were infected naturally. This is the first reported evidence of infection of red squirrels and chipmunks with a Modoc-like virus. These data extend the range of Modoc-like viruses northward by 1,500 km and comprise the first isolate from mammals in the boreal forest of Canada."	0

Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was detected in sera from 4 animals among 62 apparently healthy chipmunks. Electron microscopic examination of the HBsAg-positive sera revealed virus-like spherical particles 20-22 nm in diameter. Extraction of nucleic acid under annealing conditions from the serum samples containing virus-like particles yielded a single species of DNA molecule with the electrophoretic mobility of 5.6-kb double-stranded DNA. Four overlapping clones that encompassed almost the full-length viral genome, except both ends, were obtained. By sequencing these clones, we determined the sequence of 5097 nucleotides of the viral DNA. Two open reading frames were identified, with the left side open reading frame encoding a putative nonstructural protein and the right side open reading frame encoding a putative capsid protein. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences showed significant homology to parvovirus B19 and simian parvovirus, but showed little homology to other mammalian autonomous parvoviruses or adeno-associated viruses. These observations indicate that the virus isolated from Manchurian chipmunks is a novel parvovirus and may be a potentially useful animal model of human B19 infection as a new member of the Erythrovirus genus of the Parvoviridae."	0

tamias striatus	Rodentia	bunyamwera orthobunyavirus	8827670	The role of deer as a possible reservoir host of potosi virus, a newly recognized arbovirus in the United States.	"Potosi (POT) virus (Bunyaviridae) was isolated from Aedes albopictus, an introduced Asian mosquito species, collected at a used tire yard in Potosi, Missouri (USA), in August and September, 1989. In September, 1990, small animals were trapped at the tire yard and six cattle were sampled at an adjacent farm; in November 1990 and 1991, blood samples were collected with filter paper strips from 364 hunter-killed, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the region to determine the possible reservoir hosts of the virus. Deer specimens from Arkansas (n = 70), Colorado (n = 29), and Iowa (n = 763) (USA) were also analyzed. Specimens from 33 small vertebrates captured at the tire yard were negative for viruses. Only one eastern chipmunk (Tamias striatus) and none of six cattle had neutralizing (N) antibody against POT virus by the plaque-reduction serum neutralization test in Vero cell culture but 45 (25%) of 178 deer specimens in 1990 and 55 (30%) of 186 in 1991 were antibody positive. The 186 deer sera from 1991 were tested further and 29 (16%) were also N antibody positive to Cache Valley (CV) virus. From the 763 deer specimens tested from Iowa in 1993, 114 (15%) had N antibody to POT virus. Of 70 serum specimens from Arkansas deer in 1990, 33 (47%) had N antibody to POT and 15 (21%) to CV viruses; two (7%) of 29 CV negative serum specimens from Colorado deer in 1981 were serologically positive to POT virus. Three eastern chipmunks were experimentally inoculated with POT virus to determine their reservoir potential; none became viremic but all developed N antibody. Thus we propose that POT virus may be another virus regularly infecting wild deer populations but its impact on the health of these animals is unknown."	0

Experimental Infection of Eastern Gray Squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) with West Nile Virus. American Journal of Tropical Medical Hygiene 2008 79:447-451.	"Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) have shown high West Nile virus (WNV) seroprevalence, and WNV infection has been suggested as a cause of morbidity and mortality in this species. We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean viremias of 10(5.1) and 10(4.8) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on days 3 and 4 post-infection (DPI) and estimated that approximately 2.1% of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1-5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities. The low viremias and lack of mortality observed in S. carolinensis suggest that they may be useful as sentinels of spillover from the enzootic amplification cycle."	0
tamias striatus	Rodentia	west nile virus	23212739	West Nile virus associations in wild mammals: a synthesis.	"Exposures to West Nile virus (WNV) have been documented in a variety of wild mammals in both the New and Old Worlds. This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized."	1
tamiasciurus hudsonicus	Rodentia	modoc virus	2987550	Modoc-like virus isolated from wild deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) in Alberta.	"Small mammals were trapped in northeastern Alberta, Canada during 1976. Blood samples from these animals were tested for virus by inoculation of suckling mice. Blood clots from two deer mice yielded isolates of the same virus. The virus was related antigenically to a number of flaviviruses which have been isolated from mammals in Central America and North America and was related most closely to Modoc virus. Physical, chemical, and biological properties of the virus were similar also to those of Modoc virus. It did not produce illness or death in deer mice inoculated in the laboratory. Neutralization tests indicated that 1/38 (3%) red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), 3/35 (9%) least chipmunks (Eutamius minimus), 13/109 (12%) deer mice, and 3/50 (6%) humans were infected naturally. This is the first reported evidence of infection of red squirrels and chipmunks with a Modoc-like virus. These data extend the range of Modoc-like viruses northward by 1,500 km and comprise the first isolate from mammals in the boreal forest of Canada."	0

thryonomys swinderianus	Rodentia	lebombo virus	2033390	Brown SE, Morrison HG, Karabatsos N, and Knudson DL (1991). Genetic relatedness of two new Orbivirus serogroups: Orungo and Lebombo. The Journal of general virology 72 ( Pt 5):1065-1072.	"Orungo and Lebombo orbivirus isolates were examined for their intra- and intergroup genetic relatedness by blot hybridization and gene reassortment; blot hybridization was also used to examine the relatedness of selected Orungo and Lebombo isolates to known orbiviruses. Among the Orungo isolates, greater than 74% sequence similarity was shown in the majority of their genes. Gene 2 was the most divergent gene, with four unique types identified, and genes 5, 6 and 10 were variant among the isolates. Plaque reduction neutralization tests revealed at least four serotypes, a result which correlated with the hybridization data. Gene reassortment was shown between two representative Orungo isolates. Among the Lebombo isolates, two hybridization types were identified between which gene reassortment was demonstrated. Unique genes were not shown, whereas genes 2, 5 and 10 exhibited minor sequence variability. Geographic distribution correlated with relatedness among the Lebombo isolates, which was not the case among the Orungo isolates. Orungo and Lebombo viruses did not cross-hybridize or reassort their genes in vitro, in intergroup studies. In blot hybridization tests of Orungo and Lebombo isolates with known orbivirus serogroups and ungrouped orbiviruses, no strong cross-hybridization was seen. These results demonstrate that Orungo and Lebombo are distinct from each other and from other orbiviruses, and should therefore be recognized as two new Orbivirus serogroups."	0
vespertilio murinus	Chiroptera	mammalian orthoreovirus	22931153	Identification of Mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 in Italian bats.	"Summary This study describes the isolation and molecular characterization of Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) in microbats. Faecal samples and dead individuals available from rehabilitation centres or collected from known roost sites were virologically tested. In total, 112 carcasses of bats found dead, and 44 faecal samples were analysed. Nineteen viral strains were isolated by in vitro cell culture from faecal and tissue samples of different bat species (Pipistrellus khulii, Tadarida teniotis, Rhinolophus hipposideros and Vespertilio murinus), and they were morphologically identified as reoviruses by negative staining electron microscopy observation. The definitive assignment of all isolates to MRV was confirmed by RT-PCR assays targeting the L1 gene. Through a multiplex RT-PCR assay targeting the S1 gene, we typed 15 of 19 isolates as MRV type 3. Partial L1 (416 bp) and complete S1 (1416 bp) sequences of the isolates were analysed and compared with those of reference strains obtained from GenBank, belonging to the three serotypes. Molecular analysis of the S1 gene revealed that the amino acid residues associated with neurotropism (198-204NLAIRLP, 249I, 350D and 419E) were highly conserved among the Italian bat strains. These results suggest that potentially neurotropic MRV type 3 strains are widespread among Italian bats. Furthermore, the identification of MRV type 3 in bat species such as Pipistrellus Khulii, which is common in urban areas and known for its close contact with humans, underlines the need for vigilance."	0
vespertilio murinus	Chiroptera	rabies lyssavirus	1683127	New strains of rabies-related viruses isolated from bats in the Ukraine.	"Two strains (UB-1 and UB-2) of rabies-related viruses were isolated from the brain of Nyctalus noctula and Vespertilio murinus captured from the hollows of tall trees on the left bank of Pripyat river in the Volynsky region of Ukrainian S.S.R. The viruses were isolated by means of intracerebral inoculation to white mice. The isolates were identified as rabies-related viruses of Duvenhage type in an indirect test of fluorescent antibodies with the panels of nucleocapsid monoclonal antibodies (NC Mab) provided by Wistar Institute (Philadelphia) and by Central Veterinary Laboratory (CVL, Weybridge). During the typing with the Wistar panel of NC Mab complete antigenic similarity was established between the newly isolated strain and Yuli virus. The reaction with CVL NC Mab revealed group-specific antigenic similarity between Yuli virus on one hand, Duvenhage-6 and Duvenhage-66 on the other hand, as well as between UB-1 and UB-2 and Duvenhage-26. The reaction with antibodies to clones DB-3,4,6,9, and 10 detected antigenic similarity between the viruses of chiropteric origin isolated in the U.S.S.R., North-West Europe as well in Africa, although some differences were discovered. Yuli, UB-1, and UB-2 viruses isolated in the U.S.S.R. were proved to belong to Duvenhage group of viruses (serotype 4)."	0

zygodontomys brevicauda	Rodentia	guanarito mammarenavirus	11508391	Fulhorst C, Milazzo M, Bradley R, and Peppers L (2001a). Experimental infection of Neotoma albigula (Muridae) with Whitewater Arroyo virus (Arenaviridae). Am J Trop Med Hyg 65:147-151.	"The Whitewater Arroyo virus (WWA) is a newly described North American arenavirus. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the biology of this virus in its natural rodent host, Neotoma albigula (white-throated woodrat). Thirteen adult, 7 juvenile, and 8 newborn woodrats each were inoculated subcutaneously with 1,000 cell culture infectious dose50 of the WWA virus prototype strain AV 9310135. All 28 animals became infected (as measured by the recovery of infectious virus and/or seroconversion) and no overt illness was associated with infection. Infection and virus shedding in the adult animals were transient (less than 59 days) whereas virus shedding in animals inoculated at birth persisted through 164 days of age. These results indicate that the duration of WWA virus infection in N. albigula is dependent upon the animal's age at the onset of infection and that neonatal infection can result in chronic (perhaps lifelong) virus shedding."	0
