Changes in immune cell populations in the periphery and liver of GBV-B-infected and convalescent tamarins (Saguinus labiatus)								VIRUS RESEARCH				179				93	101		10.1016/j.virusres.2013.11.006				JAN 22 2014	2014	Flaviviruses related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) in suitable animal models may provide further insight into the role that cellular immunity contributes to spontaneous clearance of HCV. We characterised changes in lymphocyte populations in tamarins with an acute GBV-B infection, a hepatitis virus of the flaviviridae. Major immune cell populations were monitored in peripheral and intra-hepatic lymphocytes at high viraemia or following a period when peripheral virus was no longer detected. Limited changes in major lymphocyte populations were apparent during high viraemia; however, the proportions of CD3(+) lymphocytes decreased and CD20(+) lymphocytes increased once peripheral viraemia became undetectable. Intrahepatic lymphocyte populations increased at both time points post-infection. Distinct expression patterns of PD-1, a marker of T-cell activation, were observed on peripheral and hepatic lymphocytes; notably there was elevated PD-1 expression on hepatic CD4(+) T-cells during high viraemia, suggesting an activated phenotype, which decreased following clearance of peripheral viraemia. At times when peripheral vRNA was not detected, suggesting viral clearance, we were able to readily detect GBV-B RNA in the liver, indicative of long-term virus replication. This study is the first description of changes in lymphocyte populations during GBV-B infection of tamarins and provides a foundation for more detailed investigations of the responses that contribute to the control of GBV-B infection.

An increasing concern towards West Nile disease (WND) has been observed due to the high number of human and animal cases reported in these areas confirming the importance of this zoonosis. Anew epidemiological scenario is currently emerging: although new introductions of the virus from abroad are always possible, confirming the epidemiological role played by migratory birds, the infection endemisation in some European territories today is a reality supported by the constant reoccurrence of the same strains across years in the same geographical areas. Despite the WND reoccurrence in the Old World, the overwintering mechanisms are not well known, and the role of local resident birds or mosquitoes in this context is poorly understood. A recent new epidemiological scenario is the spread of lineage 2 strain across European and Mediterranean countries in regions where lineage 1 strain is still circulating creating favourable conditions for genetic reassortments and emergence of new strains. This paper summarizes the main epidemiological findings on WNV occurrence in Europe and in the Mediterranean Basin from 2009 to 2013, considering potential future spread patterns.

Fifty arboviruses pathogenic for animals have been documented worldwide, belonging to seven families: Togaviridae (mosquito-borne Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalilitis viruses; Sindbis, Middelburg, Getah, and Semliki Forest viruses), Flaviviridae (mosquito-borne yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile, Usutu, Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Tembusu and Wesselsbron viruses; tick-borne encephalitis, louping ill, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, and Tyuleniy viruses), Bunyaviridae (tick-borne Nairobi sheep disease, Soldado, and Bhanja viruses; mosquito-borne Rift Valley fever, La Crosse, Snowshoe hare, and Cache Valley viruses; biting midges-borne Main Drain, Akabane, Aino, Shuni, and Schmallenberg viruses), Reoviridae (biting midges-borne African horse sickness, Kasba, bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer, lbaraki, equine encephalosis, Peruvian horse sickness, and Yunnan viruses), Rhabdoviridae (sandfly/mosquito-borne bovine ephemeral fever, vesicular stomatitis-Indiana, vesicular stomatitis-New Jersey, vesicular stomatitis-Alagoas, and Coccal viruses), Orthomyxoviridae (tick-borne Thogoto virus), and Asfarviridae (tick-borne African swine fever virus). They are transmitted to animals by five groups of hematophagous arthropods of the subphyllum Chelicerata (order Acarina, families lxodidae and Argasidae ticks) or members of the class Insecta: mosquitoes (family Culicidae); biting midges (family Ceratopogonidae); sandflies (subfamily Phlebotominae); and cimicid bugs (family Cimicidae). Arboviral diseases in endotherm animals may therefore be classified as: tick-borne (louping ill and tick-borne encephalitis, Omsk hemorrhagic fever, Kyasanur Forest disease, Tyuleniy fever, Nairobi sheep disease, Soldado fever, Bhanja fever, Thogoto fever, African swine fever), mosquito-borne (Eastern, Western, and Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitides, Highlands J disease, Getah disease, Semliki Forest disease, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, Murray Valley encephalitis, West Nile encephalitis, Usutu disease, Israel turkey meningoencephalitis, Tembusu disease/duck egg-drop syndrome, Wesselsbron disease, La Crosse encephalitis, Snowshoe hare encephalitis, Cache Valley disease, Main Drain disease, Rift Valley fever, Peruvian horse sickness, Yunnan disease), sandfly-borne (vesicular stomatitis Indiana, New Jersey, and Alagoas, Cocal disease), midge-borne (Akabane disease, Aino disease, Schmallenberg disease, Shuni disease, African horse sickness, Kasba disease, bluetongue, epizootic hemorrhagic disease of deer, lbaraki disease, equine encephalosis, bovine ephemeral fever, Kotonkan disease), and cimicid-borne (Buggy Creek disease). Animals infected with these arboviruses regularly develop a febrile disease accompanied by various nonspecific symptoms; however, additional severe syndromes may occur: neurological diseases (meningitis, encephalitis, encephalomyelitis); hemorrhagic symptoms; abortions and congenital disorders; or vesicular stomatitis.Certain arboviral diseases cause significant economic losses in domestic animals for example, Eastern, Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitides, West Nile encephalitis, Nairobi sheep disease, Rift Valley fever, Akabane fever, Schmallenberg disease (emerged recently in Europe), African horse sickness, bluetongue, vesicular stomatitis, and African swine fever; all of these (except for Akabane and Schmallenberg diseases) are notifiable to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE, 2012).

J	Isken, Olaf; Langerwisch, Ulrike; Schoenherr, Robert; Lamp, Benjamin; Schroeder, Kristin; Duden, Rainer; Ruemenapf, Tillmann H.; Tautz, Norbert								Functional Characterization of Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus Nonstructural Protein 5A by Reverse Genetic Analysis and Live Cell Imaging								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				88	1			82	98		10.1128/JVI.01957-13				JAN 2014	2014	Nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) is a hydrophilic phosphoprotein with RNA binding activity and a critical component of the viral replicase. In silico analysis suggests that NS5A encompasses three domains interconnected by two low-complexity sequences (LCSs). While domain I harbors two functional determinants, an N-terminal amphipathic helix important for membrane association, and a Zn-binding site essential for RNA replication, the structure and function of the C-terminal half of NS5A are still ill defined. In this study, we introduced a panel of 10 amino acid deletions covering the C-terminal half of NS5A. In the context of a highly efficient monocistronic replicon, deletions in LCS I and the N-terminal part of domain II, as well as in domain III, were tolerated with regard to RNA replication. When introduced into a bicistronic replicon, only deletions in LCS I and the N-terminal part of domain II were tolerated. In the context of the viral full-length genome, these mutations allowed residual virion morphogenesis. Based on these data, a functional monocistronic BVDV replicon coding for an NS5A variant with an insertion of the fluorescent protein mCherry was constructed. Live cell imaging demonstrated that a fraction of NS5A-mCherry localizes to the surface of lipid droplets. Taken together, this study provides novel insights into the functions of BVDV NS5A. Moreover, we established the first pestiviral replicon expressing fluorescent NS5A-mCherry to directly visualize functional viral replication complexes by live cell imaging.

J	Jackowiak, Paulina; Kuls, Karolina; Budzko, Lucyna; Mania, Anna; Figlerowicz, Magdalena; Figlerowicz, Marek								Phylogeny and molecular evolution of the hepatitis C virus								INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION				21				67	82		10.1016/j.meegid.2013.10.021				JAN 2014	2014	The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a globally prevalent human pathogen that causes persistent liver infections in most infected individuals. HCV is classified into seven phylogenetically distinct genotypes, which have different geographical distributions and levels of genetic diversity. Some of these genotypes are endemic and highly divergent, whereas others disseminate rapidly on an epidemic scale but display lower variability. HCV phylogeny has an important impact on disease epidemiology and clinical practice because the viral genotype may determine the pathogenesis and severity of the resultant chronic liver disease. In addition, there is a clear association between the HCV genotype and its susceptibility to antiviral treatment. Similarly to other RNA viruses, in a single host, HCV exists as a combination of related but genetically different variants. The whole formation is the actual target of selection exerted by a host organism and antiviral therapeutics. The genetic structure of the viral population is largely shaped by mutations that are constantly introduced during an error-prone replication. However, it appears that genetic recombination may also contribute to this process. This heterogeneous collection of variants has a significant ability to evolve towards the fitness optimum. Interestingly, negative selection, which restricts diversity, emerges as an essential force that drives HCV evolution. It is becoming clear that HCV evolves to become stably adapted to the host environment. In this article we review the HCV phylogeny and molecular evolution in the context of host-virus interactions.

Thus, a highly sensitive real-time RT-PCR assay was developed for the detection of RVFV at low viral loads. A new RVF SYBR Green RT-PCR targeting the M segment was tested on serum from different RVF seronegative ruminant species collected from May 2010 to August 2011 in Madagascar and the Comoros archipelago and compared with a RVF specific quantitative real time RT-PCR technique, which is considered as the reference technique. The specificity was tested on a wide range of arboviruses or other viruses giving RVF similar clinical signs. A total of 38 out of 2756 serum samples tested positive with the new RT-PCR, whereas the reference technique only detected 5 out of the 2756. The described RT-PCR is an efficient diagnostic tool for the investigation of enzootic circulation of the RVF virus. It allows the detection of low viral RNA loads adapted for the investigations of reservoirs or specific epidemiological situations such as inter-epizootic periods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The array of host receptors important for HCV entry now includes HSGP, LDLR, CD81, SRB1, CLDN1, occludin, and NPC1L1. The interaction of host and nonstructural viral proteins is essential for genome replication. Long-range interactions between cis acting elements in the 5' and 3' UTRs and the NS5B coding region may control the switching between genome replication and genome packaging into virions, as well as modulate translation. Capsid assembly also involves NS5A, NS2, NS3/4A, and viral RNA as well as core protein. HCV assembly is intimately connected to host lipid metabolism and the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) resulting in a lipoviroparticle. Core, NS5A, NS2, NS3, and NS4B can regulate host metabolic processes. HCV proteins have been shown to compromise host defenses at many levels, such as NS3 and NS5A inhibition of interferon alpha and NS5A and NS5B inhibition of apoptosis.

Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) and Border disease virus of sheep infect their hosts either transiently or persistently. Cellular and humoral immunotolerance to the infecting strain is a unique feature of persistent infection (PI) by ruminant pestiviruses. Persistence, caused by transplacental infection early in fetal development, depends on virally encoded interferon antagonists that inactivate the host's innate immune response to the virus without globally interfering with its function against other viruses. At epidemiological equilibrium, approximately 1-2% of animals are PI. Successful BVDV control programs show that removal of PI animals results in viral extinction in the host population. The nucleotide sequences of ruminant pestiviruses change little during persistent infection. Nevertheless, they display large heterogeneity, pointing to a long history of virus-host coevolution in which avirulent strains are more successful.																					WOS:000336052100008	25384138

Primers with 17 to 30% of degenerate bases were used in both consecutive steps. The assay could accurately detect RABV, LBV, MOKV, DUVV, EBLV-1, EBLV-2, and ABLV. In silico sequence alignment showed a functional match with the remaining lyssavirus species. The diagnostic specificity was 100% and the sensitivity proved to be superior to that of the fluorescent antigen test. The limit of detection was <= 1 50% tissue culture infectious dose. The related vesicular stomatitis virus was not recognized, confirming the selectivity for lyssaviruses. The assay was applied to follow the evolution of rabies virus infection in the brain of mice from 0 to 10 days after intranasal inoculation. The obtained RNA curve corresponded well with the curves obtained by a one-step monospecific RABV-qRT-PCR, the fluorescent antigen test, and virus titration. Despite the presence of degenerate bases, the assay proved to be highly sensitive, specific, and reproducible.																					WOS:000335160800001	24822188

Epidemiology, geographical distribution, and economic consequences of swine zoonoses: a narrative review								EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS				2						e92	10.1038/emi.2013.87				DEC 24 2013	2013	We sought to review the epidemiology, international geographical distribution, and economic consequences of selected swine zoonoses. We performed literature searches in two stages. First, we identified the zoonotic pathogens associated with swine. Second, we identified specific swine-associated zoonotic pathogen reports for those pathogens from January 1980 to October 2012. Swine-associated emerging diseases were more prevalent in the countries of North America, South America, and Europe. Multiple factors were associated with the increase of swine zoonoses in humans including: the density of pigs, poor water sources and environmental conditions for swine husbandry, the transmissibility of the pathogen, occupational exposure to pigs, poor human sanitation, and personal hygiene. Swine zoonoses often lead to severe economic consequences related to the threat of novel pathogens to humans, drop in public demand for pork, forced culling of swine herds, and international trade sanctions. Due to the complexity of swine-associated pathogen ecology, designing effective interventions for early detection of disease, their prevention, and mitigation requires an interdisciplinary collaborative "One Health" approach from veterinarians, environmental and public health professionals, and the swine industry.

J	Zhao, Hanjun; Zhou, Jie; Jiang, Shibo; Zheng, Bo-Jian								Receptor binding and transmission studies of H5N1 influenza virus in mammals								EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS				2						e85	10.1038/emi.2013.89				DEC 18 2013	2013	The H5N1 influenza A virus that is currently circulating in Asia, Africa and Europe has resulted in persistent outbreaks in poultry with sporadic transmission to humans. Thus far, it is believed that H5N1 does not possess sufficient ability for human-to-human transmission and subsequent pandemic infection. Both receptor binding specificity and virus infectivity are key factors in determining whether influenza A virus becomes pandemic. The use of human viral isolates in various studies has helped to illustrate the changes in receptor binding specificity and virulence as a result of adaptation in humans. In this review, we highlight the important amino acids and domains of viral proteins related to receptor binding specificity that have been reported for humans and avians using mammalian models. Thus, this review will consolidate findings from studies that have shed light on the receptor binding and transmission characteristics of the H5N1 influenza virus, with the goal of improving our ability to predict the transmission efficiency or pandemic potential of new viral strains.

Vector Contact Rates on Eastern Bluebird Nestlings Do Not Indicate West Nile Virus Transmission in Henrico County, Virginia, USA								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH				10	12			6366	6379		10.3390/ijerph10126366				DEC 2013	2013	Sensitive indicators of spatial and temporal variation in vector-host contact rates are critical to understanding the transmission and eventual prevention of arboviruses such as West Nile virus (WNV). Monitoring vector contact rates on particularly susceptible and perhaps more exposed avian nestlings may provide an advanced indication of local WNV amplification. To test this hypothesis we monitored WNV infection and vector contact rates among nestlings occupying nest boxes (primarily Eastern bluebirds; Sialia sialis, Turdidae) across Henrico County, Virginia, USA, from May to August 2012. Observed host-seeking rates were temporally variable and associated with absolute vector and host abundances. Despite substantial effort to monitor WNV among nestlings and mosquitoes, we did not detect the presence of WNV in these populations. Generally low vector-nestling host contact rates combined with the negative WNV infection data suggest that monitoring transmission parameters among nestling Eastern bluebirds in Henrico County, Virginia, USA may not be a sensitive indicator of WNV activity.

Vector-Virus Interactions and Transmission Dynamics of West Nile Virus								VIRUSES-BASEL				5	12			3021	3047		10.3390/v5123021				DEC 2013	2013	West Nile virus (WNV; Flavivirus; Flaviviridae) is the cause of the most widespread arthropod-borne viral disease in the world and the largest outbreak of neuroinvasive disease ever observed. Mosquito-borne outbreaks are influenced by intrinsic (e.g., vector and viral genetics, vector and host competence, vector life-history traits) and extrinsic (e.g., temperature, rainfall, human land use) factors that affect virus activity and mosquito biology in complex ways. The concept of vectorial capacity integrates these factors to address interactions of the virus with the arthropod host, leading to a clearer understanding of their complex interrelationships, how they affect transmission of vector-borne disease, and how they impact human health. Vertebrate factors including host competence, population dynamics, and immune status also affect transmission dynamics. The complexity of these interactions are further exacerbated by the fact that not only can divergent hosts differentially alter the virus, but the virus also can affect both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts in ways that significantly alter patterns of virus transmission. This chapter concentrates on selected components of the virus-vector-vertebrate interrelationship, focusing specifically on how interactions between vector, virus, and environment shape the patterns and intensity of WNV transmission.

Deep sequencing identifies two genotypes and high viral genetic diversity of human pegivirus (GB virus C) in rural Ugandan patients								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				94				2670	2678		10.1099/vir.0.055509-0				DEC 2013	2013	Human pegivirus (HPgV), formerly 'GB virus C' or 'hepatitis G virus', is a member of the genus Flavivirus (Flaviviridae) that has garnered significant attention due to its inhibition of HIV, including slowing disease progression and prolonging survival in HIV-infected patients. Currently, there are six proposed HPgV genotypes that have roughly distinct geographical distributions. Genotypes 2 and 3 are the most comprehensively characterized, whereas those genotypes occurring on the African continent, where HPgV prevalence is highest, are less well studied. Using deep sequencing methods, we identified complete coding HPgV sequences in four of 28 patients (14.3%) in rural Uganda, east Africa. One of these sequences corresponds to genotype 1 and is the first complete genome of this genotype from east Africa. The remaining three sequences correspond to genotype 5, a genotype that was previously considered exclusively South African. All four positive samples were collected within a geographical area of less than 25 km(2), showing that multiple HPgV genotypes co-circulate in this area. Analysis of intra-host viral genetic diversity revealed that total single-nucleotide polymorphism frequency was approximately tenfold lower in HPgV than in hepatitis C virus. Finally, one patient was co-infected with HPgV and HIV, which, in combination with the high prevalence of HIV, suggests that this region would be a useful locale to study the interactions and co-evolution of these viruses.

In Malaysia, A major NiV outbreak occurred in pigs and humans from September 1998 to April 1999 that resulted in infection of 265 and death of 105 persons. About 1.1 million pigs had to be destroyed to control the outbreak. The disease was recorded in the form of a major outbreak in India in 2001 and then a small incidence in 2007, both the outbreaks in West Bengal only in humans without any involvement of pigs. There were series of human Nipah incidences in Bangladesh from 2001 till 2013 almost every year with mortality exceeding 70 %. The disease transmission from pigs acting as an intermediate host during Malaysian and Singapore outbreaks has changed in NIV outbreaks in India and Bangladesh, transmitting the disease directly from bats to human followed by human to human. The drinking of raw date palm sap contaminated with fruit bat urine or saliva containing NiV is the only known cause of outbreak of the disease in Bangladesh outbreaks. The virus is now known to exist in various fruit bats of Pteropus as well as bats of other genera in a wider belt from Asia to Africa.																					WOS:000327127100016	24426305

We also compared the bat JEV isolates with other JEV isolates available from GenBank to determine their genetic similarity. We found a high genetic homogeneity among the bat JEVs isolated in different geographical areas from various bat species at different time periods. All eight bat JEV isolates belonged to genotype III. The mean evolutionary rate of bat JEV isolates was lower than those of isolates of other origin, but this difference was not statistically significant. Based on these results, we presume that the bat JEV isolates might be evolutionarily conserved. The eight bat JEV isolates were phylogenetically similar to mosquito BN19 and human Liyujie isolates of JEV. These results indicate that bats might be involved in natural cycle of JEV.																					WOS:000327121600013	23836395

Within this framework, an integrated surveillance and control programme (MALWEST project) with thirteen associate partners was launched aiming to investigate the disease and suggest appropriate interventions. One out of seven work packages of the project is dedicated to the State of the Art report for WNV. Three expert working groups on humans, animals and mosquitoes were established. Medical databases (PubMed, Scopus) were searched together with websites: e.g., WHO, CDC, ECDC. In total, 1,092 relevant articles were initially identified and 258 of them were finally included as references regarding the current knowledge about WNV, along with 36 additional sources (conference papers, reports, book chapters). The review is divided in three sections according to the fields of interest: (1) WNV in humans (epidemiology, molecular characteristics, transmission, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, surveillance); (2) WNV in animals (epidemiological and transmission characteristics concerning birds, horses, reptiles and other animal species) and (3) WNV in mosquitoes (control, surveillance). Finally, some examples of integrated surveillance programmes are presented. The introduction and establishment of the disease in Greece and other European countries further emphasizes the need for thorough research and broadening of our knowledge on this viral pathogen.

E2 envelope protein of GBV-C plays an important role in virus entry into the cytosol, genotyping and as a marker for diagnosing GBV-C infections. Also, there is discussion on relations between E2 protein and gp41 protein of HIV. The purposes of our study are to multi aspect molecular evaluation of GB virus C E2 protein from its characteristics, mutations, structures and antigenicity which would help to new directions for future researches.Evidence Acquisition: Briefly, steps followed here were; retrieving reference sequences of E2 protein, entropy plot evaluation for finding the mutational /conservative regions, analyzing potential Glycosylation, Phosphorylation and Palmitoylation sites, prediction of primary, secondary and tertiary structures, then amino acid distributions and transmembrane topology, prediction of T and B cell epitopes, and finally visualization of epitopes and variations regions in 3D structure.Results: Based on the entropy plot, 3 hypervariable regions (HVR) observed along E2 protein located in residues 133-135, 256-260 and 279-281. Analyzing primarystructure of protein sequence revealed basic nature, instability, and low hydrophilicity of this protein.Transmembrane topology prediction showed that residues 257-270 presented outside, while residues 234- 256 and 271-293 were transmembrane regions. Just one N-glycosylation site, 5 potential phosphorylated peptides and two palmitoylation were found. Secondary structure revealed that this protein has 6 alpha-helix, 12 beta-strand 17 Coil structures. Prediction of T-cell epitopes based on HLA-A*02:01 showed that epitope NH3LLLDFVFVL-COOH is the best antigen icepitope. Comparative analysis for consensus B-cell epitopes regarding transmembrane topology, based on physico-chemical and machine learning approaches revealed that residue 231- 296 (NH2- EARLVPLILLLLWWWVNQLAVLGLPAVEAAVAGEVFAGPALSWCLGLPVVSMILGLANLVLYFRWLCOOH) is most effective and probable B cell epitope for E2 protein.Conclusions: The comprehensive analysis of a protein with important roles has never been easy, and in case of E2 envelopeglycoprotein of HGV, there is no much data on its molecular and immunological features, clinical significance and its pathogenic potential in hepatitis or any other GBV-C related diseases. So, results of the present study may explain some structural, physiological and immunological functions of this protein in GBV-C, as well as designing new diagnostic kits and besides, help to better understanding E2 protein characteristic and other members of Flavivirus family, especially HCV.

Animal models in virus research: their utility and limitations								CRITICAL REVIEWS IN MICROBIOLOGY				39	4			325	361		10.3109/1040841X.2012.711740				NOV 2013	2013	Viral diseases are important threats to public health worldwide. With the number of emerging viral diseases increasing the last decades, there is a growing need for appropriate animal models for virus studies. The relevance of animal models can be limited in terms of mimicking human pathophysiology. In this review, we discuss the utility of animal models for studies of influenza A viruses, HIV and SARS-CoV in light of viral emergence, assessment of infection and transmission risks, and regulatory decision making. We address their relevance and limitations. The susceptibility, immune responses, pathogenesis, and pharmacokinetics may differ between the various animal models. These complexities may thwart translating results from animal experiments to the humans. Within these constraints, animal models are very informative for studying virus immunopathology and transmission modes and for translation of virus research into clinical benefit. Insight in the limitations of the various models may facilitate further improvements of the models.																					WOS:000325403700001	22978742

Continent-wide panmixia of an African fruit bat facilitates transmission of potentially zoonotic viruses								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				4						2770	10.1038/ncomms3770				NOV 2013	2013	The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, is Africa's most widely distributed and commonly hunted fruit bat, often living in close proximity to human populations. This species has been identified as a reservoir of potentially zoonotic viruses, but uncertainties remain regarding viral transmission dynamics and mechanisms of persistence. Here we combine genetic and serological analyses of populations across Africa, to determine the extent of epidemiological connectivity among E. helvum populations. Multiple markers reveal panmixia across the continental range, at a greater geographical scale than previously recorded for any other mammal, whereas populations on remote islands were genetically distinct. Multiple serological assays reveal antibodies to henipaviruses and Lagos bat virus in all locations, including small isolated island populations, indicating that factors other than population size and connectivity may be responsible for viral persistence. Our findings have potentially important public health implications, and highlight a need to avoid disturbances that may precipitate viral spillover.																					WOS:000328023900008	24253424

The henipaviruses emerged in the 1990s, spilling over from their natural bat hosts and causing serious disease outbreaks in humans and livestock. Hendra virus emerged in Australia and since 1994 there have been 7 human infections with 4 case fatalities. Nipah virus first appeared in Malaysia and subsequent outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh and India. In total, there have been an estimated 582 human cases of Nipah virus and of these, 54% were fatal. Their broad species tropism and ability to cause fatal respiratory and/or neurologic disease in humans and animals make them important transboundary biological threats. Recent experimental findings in animals have demonstrated that a human monoclonal antibody targeting the viral G glycoprotein is an effective post-exposure treatment against Hendra and Nipah virus infection. In addition, a subunit vaccine based on the G glycoprotein of Hendra virus affords protection against Hendra and Nipah virus challenge. The vaccine has been developed for use in horses in Australia and is the first vaccine against a Biosafety Level-4 (BSL-4) agent to be licensed and commercially deployed. Together, these advances offer viable approaches to address Hendra and Nipah virus infection of livestock and people. Published by Elsevier B.V.																					WOS:000328179300002	23838047

Hepatitis C virus infections in the Democratic Republic of Congo exhibit a cohort effect								INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION				19				386	394		10.1016/j.meegid.2013.01.021				OCT 2013	2013	The prevalence and genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV) in many regions of sub-Saharan Africa is poorly characterized, including in the Democratic Republic of Congo the largest country in the region and one of the most populous. To address this situation we conducted a molecular epidemiological survey of HCV and HPgV (previously named GB Virus C or hepatitis G virus) in samples collected in 2007 from 299 males from the DRC, whose ages ranged from 21 to 71 years old. Samples were tested for the presence of HCV antibodies by ELISA and reactive samples were subsequently tested for HCV RNA using RT-PCR in which both the HCV Core and NS5B genome regions were amplified. Remaining samples were tested for HPgV RNA and the HPgV NS3 genome region of positive samples was amplified. For HCV, 13.7% of the samples were seropositive (41/299) but only 3.7% were viremic (11/299). HPgV RNA was found in 12.7% (33/259) of samples. HCV viremia was strongly associated with age; the percentage of samples that contained detectable HCV RNA was similar to 0.5% in those younger than 50 and 13% in those older than 50. Our study represents the first systematic survey of HCV genetic diversity in the DRC. HCV sequences obtained belonged to diverse lineages of genotype 4, including subtypes 4c, 4k, 4l and 4r, plus one unclassified lineage that may constitute a new subtype. These data suggest that HCV in the DRC exhibits an age 'cohort effect', as has been recently reported in neighbouring countries, and are consistent with the hypothesis that HCV transmission rates were higher in the mid-twentieth century, possibly as a result of parenteral, iatrogenic, or other unidentified factors. Different HCV subtypes were associated with individuals of different ages, implying that HCV infection in the DRC may have arisen through multiple separate HCV epidemics with different causes.

Diversity and Epidemiology of Mokola Virus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				7	10					e2511	10.1371/journal.pntd.0002511				OCT 2013	2013	Mokola virus (MOKV) appears to be exclusive to Africa. Although the first isolates were from Nigeria and other Congo basin countries, all reports over the past 20 years have been from southern Africa. Previous phylogenetic studies analyzed few isolates or used partial gene sequence for analysis since limited sequence information is available for MOKV and the isolates were distributed among various laboratories. The complete nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, matrix and glycoprotein genes of 18 MOKV isolates in various laboratories were sequenced either using partial or full genome sequencing using pyrosequencing and a phylogenetic analysis was undertaken. The results indicated that MOKV isolates from the Republic of South Africa, Zimbabwe, Central African Republic and Nigeria clustered according to geographic origin irrespective of the genes used for phylogenetic analysis, similar to that observed with Lagos bat virus. A Bayesian Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo(MCMC) analysis revealed the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of MOKV to be between 279 and 2034 years depending on the genes used. Generally, all MOKV isolates showed a similar pattern at the amino acid sites considered influential for viral properties.																					WOS:000330376500043	24205423

Reviews of the scientific literature spanning 1950-2008 have documented the progress made in developing small-animal models of poxvirus infection and identifying novel antiviral agents. Compounds of considerable interest include cidofovir, CMX001 and ST-246((R)) (tecovirimat; SIGA Technologies, NY, USA). New inhibitors have been identified since 2008, most of which do not exhibit the kind of potency and selectivity required for drug development. Two promising agents include 4 '-thio-idoxuridine (a nucleoside analog) and mDEF201 (an adenovirus-vectored interferon). Compounds that have been effectively used in combination studies include vaccinia immune globulin, cidofovir, ST-246 and CMX001. In the future there may be an increase in experimental work using active compounds in combination.																					WOS:000329360900012	24563659

Relevance of Rift Valley fever to public health in the European Union								CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION				19	8			705	708		10.1111/1469-0691.12163				AUG 2013	2013	Rift Valley fever (RVF), a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by a phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), is considered to be one of the most important viral zoonoses in Africa. It is also a potential bioterrorism agent. Transmitted by mosquitoes or by direct contact with viraemic products, RVF affects both livestock and humans, causing abortion storms in pregnant ruminants and sudden death in newborns. The disease provokes flu syndrome in most human cases, but also severe encephalitic or haemorrhagic forms and death. There is neither a treatment nor a vaccine for humans. The disease, historically confined to the African continent, recently spread to the Arabian Peninsula and Indian Ocean. Animal movements, legal or illegal, strongly contribute to viral spread, threatening the Mediterranean basin and Europe, where competent vectors are present. Given the unpredictability of virus introduction and uncertainties about RVF epidemiology, there is an urgent need to fill the scientific gaps by developing large regional research programmes, to build predictive models, and to implement early warning systems and surveillance designs adapted to northern African and European countries.

The WNV has a wide geographic distribution that includes Africa, Europe, Asia, America and Australia. Recently, it has re-emerged as an important pathogenic organism, illustrated by the series of WNV outbreaks in North America and in Europe. Several hundred people are sacrificed by WNV infection every year. WNV can infect many mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. A variety of diagnoses for WNV infection have been developed, such as virus isolation, nucleotide amplification, antigen detection and serology. Flaviviruses, including WNV, share common nucleotide sequences and antigenic epitopes. Understanding these properties that can influence cross-reactivity is important for accurate diagnosis, especially because areas with multiple flaviviruses are currently expanding. Herein, the authors outline the different diagnostic methods for detecting WNV infection as well as important considerations in using these methods.																					WOS:000323541800007	23977935

A Novel Hepacivirus with an Unusually Long and Intrinsically Disordered NS5A Protein in a Wild Old World Primate								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	16			8971	8981		10.1128/JVI.00888-13				AUG 2013	2013	GB virus B (GBV-B; family Flaviviridae, genus Hepacivirus) has been studied in New World primates as a model for human hepatitis C virus infection, but the distribution of GBV-B and its relatives in nature has remained obscure. Here, we report the discovery of a novel and highly divergent GBV-B-like virus in an Old World monkey, the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza), in Uganda. The new virus, guereza hepacivirus (GHV), clusters phylogenetically with GBV-B and recently described hepaciviruses infecting African bats and North American rodents, and it shows evidence of ancient recombination with these other hepaciviruses. Direct sequencing of reverse-transcribed RNA from blood plasma from three of nine colobus monkeys yielded near-complete GHV genomes, comprising two distinct viral variants. The viruses contain an exceptionally long nonstructural 5A (NS5A) gene, approximately half of which codes for a protein with no discernible homology to known proteins. Computational structure-based analyses indicate that the amino terminus of the GHV NS5A protein may serve a zinc-binding function, similar to the NS5A of other viruses within the family Flaviviridae. However, the 521-amino-acid carboxy terminus is intrinsically disordered, reflecting an unusual degree of structural plasticity and polyfunctionality. These findings shed new light on the natural history and evolution of the hepaciviruses and on the extent of structural variation within the Flaviviridae.

Establishment of cell line from embryonic tissue of Pipistrellus ceylonicus bat species from India & its susceptibility to different viruses								INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH				138				224	231						AUG 2013	2013	Background & objectives: Pipistrellus ceylonicus bat species is widely distributed in South Asia, with additional populations recorded in China and Southeast Asia. Bats are the natural reservoir hosts for a number of emerging zoonotic diseases. Attempts to isolate bat-borne viruses in various terrestrial mammalian cell lines have sometimes been unsuccessful. The bat cell lines are useful in isolation and propagation of many of the viruses harboured by bats. New stable bat cell lines are needed to help such investigations and to assist in the study of bat immunology and virus-host interactions. In this study we made an attempt to develop a cell line from P. ceylonicus bats.Methods: An effort was made to establish cell line from embryo of P. ceylonicus species of bat after seeding to Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10 per cent foetal bovine serum; a primary cell line was established and designated as NIV-BtEPC. Mitochondrial DNA profile analysis was done using cyt-b and ND-1 gene sequences from the cell line. Phylogenetic tree was constructed using neighbour-joining algorithm for cyt-b and ND-1 genes with 1000-bootstrap replicates.Results: NIV-BtEPC cell line was susceptible to Chandipura (CHPV) and novel adenovirus (BtAdv-RLM) isolated from Rousettus leschenaulti from India but did not support multiplication of a number of Bunyaviruses, Alphaviruses and Flavivirus. This might be useful for isolation of a range of viruses and investigation of unknown aetiological agents.Interpretation & conclusions: In this study, a new bat cell line was developed from P. ceylonicus. This cell line was successfully tested for the susceptibility to Chandipura and BtAdv-RLM virus isolated from bats. The approach developed and optimised in this study may be applicable to the other species of bats and this established cell line can be used to facilitate virus isolation and basic research into virus-host interaction.

Evolutionary History and Phylogeography of Rabies Viruses Associated with Outbreaks in Trinidad								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				7	8					e2365	10.1371/journal.pntd.0002365				AUG 2013	2013	Bat rabies is an emerging disease of public health significance in the Americas. The Caribbean island of Trinidad experiences periodic outbreaks within the livestock population. We performed molecular characterisation of Trinidad rabies virus (RABV) and used a Bayesian phylogeographic approach to investigate the extent to which outbreaks are a result of in situ evolution versus importation of virus from the nearby South American mainland. Trinidadian RABV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related sequences. They fell into two largely temporally defined lineages designated Trinidad I and II. The Trinidad I lineage which included sequences from 1997-2000 (all but two of which were from the northeast of the island) was most closely related to RABV from Ecuador (2005, 2007), French Guiana (1990) and Venezuela (1993, 1994). Trinidad II comprised sequences from the southwest of the island, which clustered into two groups: Trinidad IIa, which included one sequence each from 2000 and 2007, and Trinidad IIb including all 2010 sequences. The Trinidad II sequences were most closely related to sequences from Brazil (1999, 2004) and Uruguay (2007, 2008). Phylogeographic analyses support three separate RABV introductions from the mainland from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. These data also indicate co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000. In light of these findings and the likely vampire bat origin of Trinidadian RABV, further studies should be conducted to investigate the relationship between RABV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat population ecology, in particular any movement between the mainland and Trinidad.

The transmission potential of Rift Valley fever virus among livestock in the Netherlands: a modelling study								VETERINARY RESEARCH				44						58	10.1186/1297-9716-44-58				JUL 22 2013	2013	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic vector-borne infection and causes a potentially severe disease. Many mammals are susceptible to infection including important livestock species. Although currently confined to Africa and the near-East, this disease causes concern in countries in temperate climates where both hosts and potential vectors are present, such as the Netherlands. Currently, an assessment of the probability of an outbreak occurring in this country is missing. To evaluate the transmission potential of RVFV, a mathematical model was developed and used to determine the initial growth and the Floquet ratio, which are indicators of the probability of an outbreak and of persistence in a periodic changing environment caused by seasonality. We show that several areas of the Netherlands have a high transmission potential and risk of persistence of the infection. Counter-intuitively, these are the sparsely populated livestock areas, due to the high vector-host ratios in these areas. Culex pipiens s.l. is found to be the main driver of the spread and persistence, because it is by far the most abundant mosquito. Our investigation underscores the importance to determine the vector competence of this mosquito species for RVFV and its host preference.																					WOS:000322729300001	23876054

The greater Congo basin region, including Uganda, has historically been a hot spot for emergence of known and novel arboviruses. Surveillance of arthropod vectors is a critical activity in monitoring and predicting outbreaks of arboviral disease, and identification of blood meals in engorged arthropods collected during surveillance efforts provides insight into the ecology of arboviruses and their vectors. As part of an ongoing arbovirus surveillance project we analyzed blood meals from engorged mosquitoes collected at five sites in western Uganda November 2008 June 2010. We extracted DNA from the dissected and triturated abdomens of engorged mosquito specimens. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I gene sequence was amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify the source of the mosquito host blood. Blood meals were analyzed from 533 engorged mosquito specimens; 440 of these blood meals were successfully identified from 33 mosquito species. Species identifications were made for 285 of the 440 identified specimens with the remainder identified to genus, family, or order. When combined with published arbovirus isolation and serologic survey data, our results suggest possible vector-reservoir relationships for several arboviruses, including Rift Valley fever virus and West Nile virus.

Three major antigenic groups related to the antigenic variants maintained in domestic dogs, vampire bats and marmosets were identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the viruses from dog-related cases segregated into four sister clades: three associated with dog-endemic cycles in Brazil and one with the crab-eating fox cycle in the northeastern region of the country. The vampire bat-and marmoset-related viruses formed two independent groups. The topology of these clades was conserved when these samples were compared to virus representatives of the currently reported rabies endemic cycles in the Americas. These results indicated the presence of multiple endemic transmission cycles maintained in four different reservoirs, domestic dogs, crab-eating foxes, vampire bats and marmosets, which are being transmitted directly to humans and should be considered as a high-risk for rabies infection.

Modulation of GB Virus B RNA Abundance by MicroRNA-122: Dependence on and Escape from MicroRNA-122 Restriction								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	13			7338	7347		10.1128/JVI.00378-13				JUL 2013	2013	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA forms an unusual interaction with human microRNA-122 (miR-122) that promotes viral RNA accumulation in cultured human liver cells and in the livers of infected chimpanzees. GB virus B (GBV-B) is a hepatotropic virus and close relative of HCV. Thus, GBV-B has been used as a surrogate system to study HCV amplification in cultured cells and in infected tamarins. It was discovered that the 5'-terminal sequences of GBV-B RNA, like HCV RNA, forms an Argonaute 2-mediated complex with two miR-122 molecules that are essential for accumulation of GBV-B subgenomic replicon RNA. However, sequences in miR-122 that anneal to each viral RNA genome were different, suggesting distinct overall structural features in HCV: miR-122 and GBV-B:miR-122 complexes. Surprisingly, a deletion that removed both miR-122 binding sites from the subgenomic GBV-B RNAs rendered viral RNA amplification independent from miR-122 and Argonaute 2. This finding suggests that structural features at the end of the viral genome dictate whether miR-122 is required to aid in maintaining viral RNA abundance.

Rift Valley Fever Risk Map Model and Seroprevalence in Selected Wild Ungulates and Camels from Kenya								PLOS ONE				8	6					e66626	10.1371/journal.pone.0066626				JUN 28 2013	2013	Since the first isolation of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the 1930s, there have been multiple epizootics and epidemics in animals and humans in sub-Saharan Africa. Prospective climate-based models have recently been developed that flag areas at risk of RVFV transmission in endemic regions based on key environmental indicators that precede Rift Valley fever (RVF) epizootics and epidemics. Although the timing and locations of human case data from the 2006-2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya have been compared to risk zones flagged by the model, seroprevalence of RVF antibodies in wildlife has not yet been analyzed in light of temporal and spatial predictions of RVF activity. Primarily wild ungulate serum samples from periods before, during, and after the 2006-2007 RVF epizootic were analyzed for the presence of RVFV IgM and/or IgG antibody. Results show an increase in RVF seropositivity from samples collected in 2007 (31.8%), compared to antibody prevalence observed from 2000-2006 (3.3%). After the epizootic, average RVF seropositivity diminished to 5% in samples collected from 2008-2009. Overlaying maps of modeled RVF risk assessments with sampling locations indicated positive RVF serology in several species of wild ungulate in or near areas flagged as being at risk for RVF. Our results establish the need to continue and expand sero-surveillance of wildlife species Kenya and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa to further calibrate and improve the RVF risk model, and better understand the dynamics of RVFV transmission.

GB Virus C Particles Inhibit T Cell Activation via Envelope E2 Protein-Mediated Inhibition of TCR Signaling								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				190	12			6351	6359		10.4049/jimmunol.1300589				JUN 15 2013	2013	Viruses enter into complex interactions within human hosts, leading to facilitation or suppression of each other's replication. Upon coinfection, GB virus C (GBV-C) suppresses HIV-1 replication in vivo and in vitro, and GBV-C coinfection is associated with prolonged survival in HIV-infected people. GBV-C is a lymphotropic virus capable of persistent infection. GBV-C infection is associated with reduced T cell activation in HIV-infected humans, and immune activation is a critical component of HIV disease pathogenesis. We demonstrate that serum GBV-C particles inhibited activation of primary human T cells. T cell activation inhibition was mediated by the envelope glycoprotein E2, because expression of E2 inhibited TCR-mediated activation of Lck. The region on the E2 protein was characterized and revealed a highly conserved peptide motif sufficient to inhibit TCR-mediated signaling. The E2 region contained a predicted Lck substrate site, and substitution of an alanine or histidine for the tyrosine reversed TCR-signaling inhibition. GBV-C E2 protein and a synthetic peptide representing the inhibitory amino acid sequence were phosphorylated by Lck in vitro. The synthetic peptide also inhibited TCR-mediated activation of primary human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. Extracellular microvesicles from GBV-C E2-expressing cells contained E2 protein and inhibited TCR signaling in bystander T cells not expressing E2. Thus, GBV-C reduced global T cell activation via competition between its envelope protein E2 and Lck following TCR engagement. This novel inhibitory mechanism of T cell activation may provide new approaches for HIV and immunoactivation therapy.																					WOS:000320373700049	23686495

Control and prevention of canine rabies: The need for building laboratory-based surveillance capacity								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				98	3			357	364		10.1016/j.antiviral.2013.04.004				JUN 2013	2013	Dogs are the source of more than 99% of human rabies virus infections in endemic regions. Without post-exposure prophylaxis, almost all cases are fatal, making rabies the most lethal infectious disease. Tens of thousands of deaths are reported annually, but the official figures are believed to be gross underestimates. Controlling canine rabies, especially in free-ranging dogs, is the first priority to reduce the burden of human disease. Because of their limited medical infrastructure, most endemic countries lack the laboratory facilities needed to diagnose human cases of viral encephalitis. Moreover, the veterinary sectors are often unable to undertake systematic surveillance and reporting of rabies in animals. Without an adequate and functioning risk assessment system that is primed for use, rabies will remain a 'neglected' and omnipresent disease, especially in poverty-stricken regions of the world. Fortunately, experience with the elimination of canine rabies from many industrialized countries has shown that these barriers are not insurmountable. Successful rabies prevention and control strategies that prove the absence of the disease depend on laboratory-based surveillance, rapid data reporting and an adequate system of risk assessment. Future control and prevention programmes should therefore coordinate the development of these key factors, creating synergies to eliminate rabies at its animal source. This article forms part of a symposium in Antiviral Research on the global elimination of canine rabies. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Research is complicated by a lack of accessible small animal models. The systematic investigation of viruses of small mammals could guide efforts to establish such models, while providing insight into viral evolutionary biology. We have assembled the so-far largest collection of small-mammal samples from around the world, qualified to be screened for bloodborne viruses, including sera and organs from 4,770 rodents (41 species); and sera from 2,939 bats (51 species). Three highly divergent rodent hepacivirus clades were detected in 27 (1.8%) of 1,465 European bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and 10 (1.9%) of 518 South African four-striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Bats showed anti-HCV immunoblot reactivities but no virus detection, although the genetic relatedness suggested by the serologic results should have enabled RNA detection using the broadly reactive PCR assays developed for this study. 210 horses and 858 cats and dogs were tested, yielding further horse-associated hepaciviruses but none in dogs or cats. The rodent viruses were equidistant to HCV, exceeding by far the diversity of HCV and the canine/equine hepaciviruses taken together. Five full genomes were sequenced, representing all viral lineages. Salient genome features and distance criteria supported classification of all viruses as hepaciviruses. Quantitative RT-PCR, RNA in-situ hybridisation, and histopathology suggested hepatic tropism with liver inflammation resembling hepatitis C. Recombinant serology for two distinct hepacivirus lineages in 97 bank voles identified seroprevalence rates of 8.3 and 12.4%, respectively. Antibodies in bank vole sera neither cross-reacted with HCV, nor the heterologous bank vole hepacivirus. Co-occurrence of RNA and antibodies was found in 3 of 57 PCR-positive bank vole sera (5.3%). Our data enable new hypotheses regarding HCV evolution and encourage efforts to develop rodent surrogate models for HCV.																					WOS:000321206600041	23818848

Although none were detected in canines, we found widespread natural infection of horses by a novel pegivirus. Unique genomic features and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that the tentatively named equine pegivirus (EPgV) represents a novel species within the Pegivirus genus. We also determined that EPgV causes persistent viremia whereas its clinical significance is undetermined.																					WOS:000319508600062	23596285

Ian								Bats are a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				110	20			8194	8199		10.1073/pnas.1303037110				MAY 14 2013	2013	Although there are over 1,150 bat species worldwide, the diversity of viruses harbored by bats has only recently come into focus as a result of expanded wildlife surveillance. Such surveys are of importance in determining the potential for novel viruses to emerge in humans, and for optimal management of bats and their habitats. To enhance our knowledge of the viral diversity present in bats, we initially surveyed 415 sera from African and Central American bats. Unbiased high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of bat-derived viruses related to hepaciviruses and pegiviruses within the family Flaviridae. Subsequent PCR screening of 1,258 bat specimens collected worldwide indicated the presence of these viruses also in North America and Asia. A total of 83 bat-derived viruses were identified, representing an infection rate of nearly 5%. Evolutionary analyses revealed that all known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, including those previously documented in humans and other primates, fall within the phylogenetic diversity of the bat-derived viruses described here. The prevalence, unprecedented viral biodiversity, phylogenetic divergence, and worldwide distribution of the bat-derived viruses suggest that bats are a major and ancient natural reservoir for both hepaciviruses and pegiviruses and provide insights into the evolutionary history of hepatitis C virus and the human GB viruses.

Desmodus rotundus capture in forest (Amazon biome) and mangrove areas in the State of Maranhao, Brazil: a longitudinal study								PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA				33	5			571	574		10.1590/S0100-736X2013000500003				MAY 2013	2013	The aim of the study was to investigate the number of captures and the control of the common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus on small farms in the municipality of Cedral, State of Maranhao, Brazil. The area was chosen because the highest number of captures in Maranhao was made there around corrals. Official control is accomplished by applying warfarin 2%, a vampiricid gel, on captured bats. In this study, control records of captured hematophagous bats were analyzed, and a questionnaire was applied in the field to identify areas with the highest number of captures. From 2005 to 2010, 223 captures in 101 farms were studied; in 190 of them existed control with application of warfarin 2% gel on the bats.. There was a total of 344 attacked livestock out of 754 exposed animals, mostly cattle (49%), followed by horses (18%), poultry (15%), pigs (9%) and goats (8%). After 6 years, the proportion of captured male and female bats was 1.08 to 1.00, compared to 1.00 to 1.21 in the first year, what demonstrates that the treatment was more effective in females. Within three years, there was control in the number of bats in 95% of the farms, after 1 to 6 captures. The main attacked area of the animal bodies was the neck. Only 57% of the owners vaccinated their livestock. The present study concluded that (1) the control with capture of bats in corrals was effective, (2) but it is prudent to monitor the area during the first 3 months after the end of control, (3) the number of captured bats was similar to the number of recent bites, and (4) D. rotundus could attack any domestic animal, with little predilection for poultry.

Identification of a previously undescribed divergent virus from the Flaviviridae family in an outbreak of equine serum hepatitis								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				110	15			E1407	E1415		10.1073/pnas.1219217110				APR 9 2013	2013	Theiler's disease is an acute hepatitis in horses that is associated with the administration of equine blood products; its etiologic agent has remained unknown for nearly a century. Here, we used massively parallel sequencing to explore samples from a recent Theiler's disease outbreak. Metatranscriptomic analysis of the short sequence reads identified a 10.5-kb sequence from a previously undescribed virus of the Flaviviridae family, which we designate "Theiler's disease-associated virus" (TDAV). Phylogenetic analysis clusters TDAV with GB viruses of the recently proposed Pegivirus genus, although it shares only 35.3% amino acid identity with its closest relative, GB virus D. An epidemiological survey of additional horses from three separate locations supports an association between TDAV infection and acute serum hepatitis. Experimental inoculation of horses with TDAV-positive plasma provides evidence that several weeks of viremia preceded liver injury and that liver disease may not be directly related to the level of viremia. Like hepatitis C virus, the best characterized Flaviviridae species known to cause hepatitis, we find TDAV is capable of efficient parenteral transmission, engendering acute and chronic infections associated with a diversity of clinical presentations ranging from subclinical infection to clinical hepatitis.

Hendra virus: a one health tale of flying foxes, horses and humans								FUTURE MICROBIOLOGY				8	4			461	474		10.2217/FMB.13.19				APR 2013	2013	Hendra virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, was first recognized following a devastating outbreak in Queensland, Australia, in 1994. The naturally acquired symptomatic infection, characterized by a rapidly progressive illness involving the respiratory system and/or CNS, has so far only been recognized in horses and humans. However, there is potential for other species to be infected, with significant consequences for animal and human health. Prevention of infection involves efforts to interrupt the bat-to-horse and horse-to-human transmission interfaces. Education and infection-control efforts remain the key to reducing risk of transmission, particularly as no effective antiviral treatment is currently available. The recent release of an equine Hendra G glycoprotein subunit vaccine is an exciting advance that offers the opportunity to curb the recent increase in equine transmission events occurring in endemic coastal regions of Australia and thereby reduce the risk of infection in humans.

GBV-C is not associated with any disease, but is associated with reduced mortality in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals. Related viruses have been isolated from chimpanzees (GBV-Ccpz) and from New World primates (GB virus type A, GBV-A). These viruses are also capable of establishing persistent infection. We determined the nucleotide sequence encoding the envelope glycoprotein (E2) of two GBV-Ccpz isolates obtained from the sera of captive chimpanzees. The deduced GBV-Ccpz E2 protein differed from human GBV-C by 31 % at the amino acid level. Similar to human GBV-C E2, expression of GBV-Ccpz E2 in a tet-off human CD4(+) Jurkat T-cell line significantly inhibited the replication of diverse HIV-1 isolates. This anti-HIV-replication effect of GBV-Ccpz E2 protein was reversed by maintaining cells in doxycycline to reduce E2 expression. Previously, we found a 17 aa region within human GBV-C E2 that was sufficient to inhibit HIV-1. Although GBV-Ccpz E2 differed by 3 aa differences in this region, the chimpanzee GBV-C 17mer E2 peptide inhibited HIV-1 replication. Similarly, the GBV-A peptide that aligns with this GBV-C E2 region inhibited HIV-1 replication despite sharing only 5 aa with the human GBV-C E2 sequence. Thus, despite amino acid differences, the peptide region on both the GBV-Ccpz and the GBV-A E2 protein inhibit HIV-1 replication similar to human GBV-C. Consequently, GBV-Ccpz or GBV-A infection of non-human primates may provide an animal model to study GB virus-HIV interactions.																					WOS:000317995200010	23288422

This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized.																					WOS:000317305200002	23212739

The evolution of virulence of West Nile virus in a mosquito vector: implications for arbovirus adaptation and evolution								BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY				13						71	10.1186/1471-2148-13-71				MAR 20 2013	2013	Background: Virulence is often coupled with replicative fitness of viruses in vertebrate systems, yet the relationship between virulence and fitness of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) in invertebrates has not been evaluated. Although the interactions between vector-borne pathogens and their invertebrate hosts have been characterized as being largely benign, some costs of arbovirus exposure have been identified for mosquitoes. The extent to which these costs may be strain-specific and the subsequent consequences of these interactions on vector and virus evolution has not been adequately explored.Results: Using West Nile virus (WNV) and Culex pipiens mosquitoes, we tested the hypothesis that intrahost fitness is correlated with virulence in mosquitoes by evaluating life history traits following exposure to either non-infectious bloodmeals or bloodmeals containing wildtype (WNV WT) or the high fitness, mosquito-adapted strain, WNV MP20 derived from WNV WT. Our results demonstrate strain-specific effects on mosquito survival, fecundity, and blood feeding behavior. Specifically, both resistance to and infection with WNV MP20, but not WNV WT, decreased survival of Cx. pipiens and altered fecundity and bloodfeeding such that early egg output was enhanced at a later cost.Conclusions: As predicted by the trade-off hypothesis of virulence, costs of infection with WNV MP20 in terms of survival were directly correlated to viral load, yet resistance to infection with this virulent strain was equally costly. Taken together, these results demonstrate that WNV MP20 infection decreases the transmission potential of Cx. pipiens populations despite the increased intrahost fitness of this strain, indicating that a virulence-transmission trade-off in invertebrates could contribute significantly to the adaptive and evolutionary constraint of arboviruses.

Polyclonal antibody preparations are increasingly being replaced by highly potent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Cocktails of mAbs and bispecific constructs can be used to simultaneously target multiple viral epitopes and to overcome issues of neutralization escape. Advances in antibody engineering have led to a large array of novel mAb formats, while deeper insight into the biology of several viruses and increasing knowledge of their neutralizing epitopes has extended the list of potential targets. In addition, progress in developing inexpensive production platforms will make antiviral mAbs more widely available and affordable. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Henipavirus infection causes severe respiratory illness and encephalitis. Although the exact route of transmission in human is unknown, epidemiological studies and in vivo studies suggest that the respiratory tract is important for virus replication. However, the target cells in the respiratory tract are unknown, as are the mechanisms by which henipaviruses can cause disease. In this study, we characterized henipavirus pathogenesis using primary cells derived from the human respiratory tract. The growth kinetics of NiV-Malaysia, NiV-Bangladesh, and HeV were determined in bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (NHBE) and small airway epithelial cells (SAEC). In addition, host responses to infection were assessed by gene expression analysis and immunoassays. Viruses replicated efficiently in both cell types and induced large syncytia. The host response to henipavirus infection in NHBE and SAEC highlighted a difference in the inflammatory response between HeV and NiV strains as well as intrinsic differences in the ability to mount an inflammatory response between NHBE and SAEC. These responses were highest during HeV infection in SAEC, as characterized by the levels of key cytokines (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, IL-1 alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 [MCP-1], and colony-stimulating factors) responsible for immune cell recruitment. Finally, we identified virus strain-dependent variability in type I interferon antagonism in NHBE and SAEC: NiV-Malaysia counteracted this pathway more efficiently than NiV-Bangladesh and HeV. These results provide crucial new information in the understanding of henipavirus pathogenesis in the human respiratory tract at an early stage of infection.

Anti-prM antibodies are found in flavivirus-infected animal sera, and they are known as relatively virus species specific antibodies. However, there are no known reports of WNV-specific epitope blocking or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) that detect anti-prM antibodies. Two anti-WNV-prM monoclonal antibodies (SHW-29C2 and SHW-3182) were generated, and c-ELISAs were developed using these monoclonal antibodies. The c-ELISAs were evaluated using WNV-infected chicken sera. Both c-ELISAs detected anti-prM antibodies in WNV-infected chicken sera and showed little cross-reactivity to antisera against Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, and Murray valley encephalitis virus. The average inhibition of chicken sera at 3 weeks post WNV infection was 61.6% in SHW-29C2-based c-ELISA and 71.8% in SHW-3182-based c-ELISA. High correlation was seen between percent inhibition in the c-ELISAs and optical density values of an IgG indirect ELISA. Additionally, SHW-3182-based c-ELISA detected antibodies against a wide variety of WNV strains. Detecting anti-PrM antibodies using c-ELISA could be useful for WNV serodiagnosis.

The lack of tractable-animal models for these viruses, in particular for HCV, has hampered the study of infection, transmission, virulence, immunity, and pathogenesis. To address this challenge, we searched for homologous viruses in small mammals, including wild rodents. Here we report the discovery of several new hepaciviruses (HCV-like viruses) and pegiviruses (GB virus-like viruses) that infect wild rodents. Complete genome sequences were acquired for a rodent hepacivirus (RHV) found in Peromyscus maniculatus and a rodent pegivirus (RPgV) found in Neotoma albigula. Unique genomic features and phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these RHV and RPgV variants represent several novel virus species in the Hepacivirus and Pegivirus genera within the family Flaviviridae. The genetic diversity of the rodent hepaciviruses exceeded that observed for hepaciviruses infecting either humans or non-primates, leading to new insights into the origin, evolution, and host range of hepaciviruses. The presence of genes, encoded proteins, and translation elements homologous to those found in human hepaciviruses and pegiviruses suggests the potential for the development of new animal systems with which to model HCV pathogenesis, vaccine design, and treatment.IMPORTANCE The genetic and biological characterization of animal homologs of human viruses provides insights into the origins of human infections and enhances our ability to study their pathogenesis and explore preventive and therapeutic interventions. Horses are the only reported host of nonprimate homologs of hepatitis C virus (HCV). Here, we report the discovery of HCV-like viruses in wild rodents. The majority of HCV-like viruses were found in deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), a small rodent used in laboratories to study viruses, including hantaviruses. We also identified pegiviruses in rodents that are distinct from the pegiviruses found in primates, bats, and horses. These novel viruses may enable the development of small-animal models for HCV, the most common infectious cause of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma after hepatitis B virus, and help to explore the health relevance of the highly prevalent human pegiviruses.

J	Lamp, Boris; Dietzel, Erik; Kolesnikova, Larissa; Sauerhering, Lucie; Erbar, Stephanie; Weingartl, Hana; Maisner, Andrea								Nipah Virus Entry and Egress from Polarized Epithelial Cells								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	6			3143	3154		10.1128/JVI.02696-12				MAR 2013	2013	Highly pathogenic Nipah virus (NiV) infections are transmitted via airway secretions and urine, commonly via the respiratory route. Epithelial surfaces represent important replication sites in both primary and systemic infection phases. NiV entry and spread from polarized epithelial cells therefore determine virus entry and dissemination within a new host and influence virus shedding via mucosal surfaces in the respiratory and urinary tract. To date, there is no knowledge regarding the entry and exit sites of NiV in polarized epithelial cells. In this report, we show for the first time that NiV can infect polarized kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) from both cell surfaces, while virus release is primarily restricted to the apical plasma membrane. Substantial amounts of basolateral infectivity were detected only after infection with high virus doses, at time points when the integrity of the cell monolayer was largely disrupted as a result of cell-to-cell fusion. Confocal immunofluorescence analyses of envelope protein distribution at early and late infection stages suggested that apical virus budding is determined by the polarized sorting of the NiV matrix protein, M. Studies with stably M-expressing and with monensin-treated cells furthermore demonstrated that M protein transport is independent from the glycoproteins, implying that the M protein possesses an intrinsic apical targeting signal.

Assessing Mathematical Models of Influenza Infections Using Features of the Immune Response								PLOS ONE				8	2					e57088	10.1371/journal.pone.0057088				FEB 28 2013	2013	The role of the host immune response in determining the severity and duration of an influenza infection is still unclear. In order to identify severity factors and more accurately predict the course of an influenza infection within a human host, an understanding of the impact of host factors on the infection process is required. Despite the lack of sufficiently diverse experimental data describing the time course of the various immune response components, published mathematical models were constructed from limited human or animal data using various strategies and simplifying assumptions. To assess the validity of these models, we assemble previously published experimental data of the dynamics and role of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, antibodies, and interferon and determined qualitative key features of their effect that should be captured by mathematical models. We test these existing models by confronting them with experimental data and find that no single model agrees completely with the variety of influenza viral kinetics responses observed experimentally when various immune response components are suppressed. Our analysis highlights the strong and weak points of each mathematical model and highlights areas where additional experimental data could elucidate specific mechanisms, constrain model design, and complete our understanding of the immune response to influenza.

Interaction between HIV-1 and GB virus type-C during coinfection status								REVISTA CHILENA DE INFECTOLOGIA				30	1			31	41		10.4067/S0716-10182013000100005				FEB 2013	2013	The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is one of the most important problems in public health. It is estimated that 33 million people are infected around the world. HIV and GBV-C share the same transmission route, being frequent the co-infection. Since both viruses replicate in CD4+ lymphocytes, recent studies have described an interaction. Decreasing of HIV viral load and higher CD4 counts have been observed in co-infected patients, leading a better clinical outcome. Nevertheless, some epidemiological studies have shown contradictory results. Additionally, in vitro models report inhibition of HIV by El, E2, NS3 and NS5A GBV-C proteins, resulting in a decreasing of p24 antigen. This review summarizes the principal findings about co-infection and mechanisms that have been proposed for HIV-1 inhibition.																					WOS:000314741800005	23450407

Since the emergence of Hendra virus in Australia in 1994 and the identification of Australian flying foxes as hosts to this virus, our appreciation of bats as reservoir hosts of henipaviruses has expanded globally to include much of Asia and areas of Africa. Despite this, little is currently known of the mechanisms by which bats harbour viruses capable of causing such severe disease in other terrestrial mammals. Pteropid bat ecology, henipavirus virology, therapeutic developments and features of henipavirus infection, pathology and disease in humans and other mammals are reviewed elsewhere in detail. This review focuses on bats as reservoir hosts to henipaviruses and features of transmission of Hendra virus and Nipah virus following spillover from these reservoir hosts.

Experimental therapies for yellow fever								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				97	2			169	179		10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.12.002				FEB 2013	2013	A number of viruses in the family Flaviviridae are the focus of efforts to develop effective antiviral therapies. Success has been achieved with inhibitors for the treatment of hepatitis C, and there is interest in clinical trials of drugs against dengue fever. Antiviral therapies have also been evaluated in patients with Japanese encephalitis and West Nile encephalitis. However, no treatment has been developed against the prototype flavivirus, yellow fever virus (YFV). Despite the availability of the live, attenuated 17D vaccine, thousands of cases of YF continue to occur each year in Africa and South America, with a significant mortality rate. In addition, a small number of vaccinees develop severe systemic infections with the 17D virus. This paper reviews current efforts to develop antiviral therapies, either directly targeting the virus or blocking detrimental host responses to infection. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Molecular Epidemiology of Bat Lyssaviruses in Europe								ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH				60	1	SI		35	45		10.1111/zph.12003				FEB 2013	2013	Bat rabies cases in Europe are principally attributed to two lyssaviruses, namely European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) and European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2). Between 1977 and 2011, 961 cases of bat rabies were reported to Rabies Bulletin Europe, with the vast majority (>97%) being attributed to EBLV-1. There have been 25 suspected cases of EBLV-2, of which 22 have been confirmed. In addition, two single isolations of unique lyssaviruses from European insectivorous bats were reported in south-west Russia in 2002 (West Caucasian bat virus) and in Germany in 2010 (Bokeloh bat lyssavirus). In this review, we present phylogenetic analyses of the EBLV-1 and EBLV-2 using partial nucleoprotein (N) gene sequences. In particular, we have analysed all EBLV-2 cases for which viral sequences (N gene, 400 nucleotides) are available (n = 21). Oropharyngeal swabs collected from two healthy Myotis daubentonii during active surveillance programmes in Scotland and Switzerland also yielded viral RNA (EBLV-2). Despite the relatively low number of EBLV-2 cases, a surprisingly large amount of anomalous data has been published in the scientific literature and Genbank, which we have collated and clarified. For both viruses, geographical relationships are clearly defined on the phylogenetic analysis. Whilst there is no clear chronological clustering for either virus, there is some evidence for host specific relationships, particularly for EBLV-1 where more host variation has been observed. Further genomic regions must be studied, in particular for EBLV-1 isolates from Spain and the EBLV-2 isolates to provide support for the existence of sublineages.

J	Eissmann, Kristin; Mueller, Sebastian; Sticht, Heinrich; Jung, Susan; Zou, Peng; Jiang, Shibo; Gross, Andrea; Eichler, Jutta; Fleckenstein, Bernhard; Reil, Heide								HIV-1 Fusion Is Blocked through Binding of GB Virus C E2D Peptides to the HIV-1 gp41 Disulfide Loop								PLOS ONE				8	1					e54452	10.1371/journal.pone.0054452				JAN 22 2013	2013	A strategy for antiviral drug discovery is the elucidation and imitation of viral interference mechanisms. HIV-1 patients benefit from a coinfection with GB Virus C (GBV-C), since HIV-positive individuals with long-term GBV-C viraemia show better survival rates than HIV-1 patients without persisting GBV-C. A direct influence of GBV-C on HIV-1 replication has been shown in coinfection experiments. GBV-C is a human non-pathogenic member of the flaviviridae family that can replicate in T and B cells. Therefore, GBV-C shares partly the same ecological niche with HIV-1. In earlier work we have demonstrated that recombinant glycoprotein E2 of GBV-C and peptides derived from the E2 N-terminus interfere with HIV entry. In this study we investigated the underlying mechanism. Performing a virus-cell fusion assay and temperature-arrested HIV-infection kinetics, we provide evidence that the HIV-inhibitory E2 peptides interfere with late HIV-1 entry steps after the engagement of gp120 with CD4 receptor and coreceptor. Binding and competition experiments revealed that the N-terminal E2 peptides bind to the disulfide loop region of HIV-1 transmembrane protein gp41. In conjunction with computational analyses, we identified sequence similarities between the N-termini of GBV-C E2 and the HIV-1 glycoprotein gp120. This similarity appears to enable the GBV-C E2 N-terminus to interact with the HIV-1 gp41 disulfide loop, a crucial domain involved in the gp120-gp41 interface. Furthermore, the results of the present study provide initial proof of concept that peptides targeted to the gp41 disulfide loop are able to inhibit HIV fusion and should inspire the development of this new class of HIV-1 entry inhibitors.

As bats are the natural host for most members of the genus Lyssavirus, the specificity of the amplification methods used for active surveillance is usually restricted to lyssaviruses. However, the presence of other rhabdoviruses in bats has also been reported. In order to broaden the scope of such methods, a new RT-PCR, able to detect a diverse range of rhabdoviruses, was designed. The method detected 81 of 86 different rhabdoviruses. In total, 1488 oropharyngeal bat swabs and 38 nycteribiid samples were analysed, and 17 unique rhabdovirus-related sequences were detected. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that those sequences detected in bats did not constitute a monophyletic group, even when originating from the same bat species. However, all of the sequences detected in nycteribiids and one sequence obtained from a bat did constitute a monophyletic group with Drosophila melanogaster sigma rhabdovirus.

Their broad species tropism together with their capacity to cause severe and often fatal disease in both humans and animals make Hendra and Nipah "overlap agents" and significant biosecurity threats. The development of effective vaccination strategies to prevent or treat henipavirus infection and disease has been an important area of research. Here, henipavirus active and passive vaccination strategies that have been examined in animal challenge models of Hendra and Nipah virus disease are summarized and discussed.

The mechanisms of pathogenesis are not well described. The first Nipah virus outbreak occurred in Malaysia, where human disease had a strong neurological component. Subsequent outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh and India and transmission and disease processes in these outbreaks appear to be different from those of the Malaysian outbreak. Until this point, virtually all Nipah virus studies in vitro and in vivo, including vaccine and pathogenesis studies, have utilized a virus isolate from the original Malaysian outbreak (NiV-M). To investigate potential differences between NiV-M and a Nipah virus isolate from Bangladesh (NiV-B), we compared NiV-M and NiV-B infection in vitro and in vivo. In hamster kidney cells, NiV-M-infection resulted in extensive syncytia formation and cytopathic effects, whereas NiV-B-infection resulted in little to no morphological changes. In vivo, NiV-M-infected Syrian hamsters had accelerated virus replication, pathology and death when compared to NiV-B-infected animals. NiV-M infection also resulted in the activation of host immune response genes at an earlier time point. Pathogenicity was not only a result of direct effects of virus replication, but likely also had an immunopathogenic component. The differences observed between NiV-M and NiV-B pathogeneis in hamsters may relate to differences observed in human cases. Characterization of the hamster model for NiV-B infection allows for further research of the strain of Nipah virus responsible for the more recent outbreaks in humans. This model can be used to study NiV-B pathogenesis, transmission, and countermeasures that could be used to control outbreaks.																					WOS:000314360200047	23342177

However, in contrast to many other species and despite expression of functional virus entry receptors, mice are resistant to henipavirus infection. We report here the susceptibility of mice deleted for the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR-KO) to both HeV and NiV. Intraperitoneally infected mice developed fatal encephalitis, with pathology and immunohistochemical features similar to what was found in humans. Viral RNA was found in the majority of analyzed organs, and sublethally infected animals developed virus-specific neutralizing antibodies. Altogether, these results reveal IFNAR-KO mice as a new small animal model to study HeV and NiV pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment and suggest the critical role of type I interferon signaling in the control of henipavirus infection.

For most of these viruses, the foodborne transmission has only been proposed theoretically or described episodically, whereas other transmission pathways are considered to be of higher importance. This includes gastroenteritis viruses like Rotavirus, Sapovirus, adenovirus, astrovirus and enteroviruses, which may be transmitted by contamination of food with human faecal excretions. Other viruses like SARS coronavirus, Henipah virus and H5N1 influenza virus are zoonotic agents, which cause severe generalized diseases and for which the possibility of foodborne transmission has been taken into consideration. The tick-borne encephalitis virus can be zoonotically transmitted under special circumstances, mainly via raw milk products from goat. Most evidence for a regular foodborne transmission route is available for hepatitis E virus. Sporadic hepatitis E cases in humans of industrialized countries have been linked repeatedly to the consumption of undercooked meat or meat products from pig, wild boar and deer. These animal species, which show no obvious clinical signs after hepatitis E virus infection, are considered to be reservoirs for this virus. Consumption of food produced from infected animals may therefore result in hepatitis E virus transmission to humans. This chapter gives an overview of the viruses occasionally transmitted by food, the diseases caused by them in humans and animals, their epidemiology and foodborne transmission, the available diagnostic methods, and discusses options for prevention and control.

However, newly recognized blood-borne infectious agents can be threats to blood safety. In order to evaluate the prevalence some of these agents in blood donors, a systematic review was conducted. Data were obtained from published papers related to HGV, Torque Teno virus (TTV), HTLV, West Nile virus (WNV) and SEN virus (SEN-V). Based on these studies, the prevalence of HGV varied from 1 to 8.6% for anti-E2 and from 0 to 4.8% for HGV RNA. The prevalence of TTV DNA and HTLV-I varied from 2.7 to 79.5% and from 0.013 to 2.3%, respectively. The WNV-specific IgM antibody and WNV RNA are negative in blood donors. Prevalence rates of SEN-V in Iranian blood donors range from 23 to 90.8%. Consequences of these infectious agents for blood safety are different. Thus, the need to perform laboratory screening as well as effectiveness and efficiency of laboratory tests depend on pathogenicity level and epidemiological conditions of emerging infections. However, being prepared based on the current level of risk and interventions to reduce the risk can be effective in reducing the potential threat for blood supply.

These patients may acquire viral infections through exogenous routes including community exposure, donor organs, and blood products or by endogenous reactivation of latent viruses. Beside major opportunistic infections due to CMV and EBV and viral hepatitis B and C, several viral diseases have recently emerged in KTRs. New medical practices or technologies, implementation of new diagnostic tools, and improved medical information have contributed to the emergence of these viral diseases in this special population. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on emerging viral diseases and newly discovered viruses in KTRs over the last two decades. We identified viruses in the field of KT that had shown the greatest increase in numbers of citations in the NCBI PubMed database. BKV was the most cited in the literature and linked to an emerging disease that represents a great clinical concern in KTRs. HHV-8, PVB19, WNV, JCV, H1N1 influenza virus A, HEV, and GB virus were the main other emerging viruses. Excluding HHV8, newly discovered viruses have been infrequently linked to clinical diseases in KTRs. Nonetheless, pathogenicity can emerge long after the discovery of the causative agent, as has been the case for BKV. Overall, antiviral treatments are very limited, and reducing immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of management. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

S	Simmonds, Peter						Bartenschlager, R		The Origin of Hepatitis C Virus								HEPATITIS C VIRUS: FROM MOLECULAR VIROLOGY TO ANTIVIRAL THERAPY		Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology		369				1	15		10.1007/978-3-642-27340-7_1	10.1007/978-3-642-27340-7			2013	2013	The origin of hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be conceptualised at several levels. Firstly, origins might refer to its dramatic spread throughout the Western world and developing countries throughout the twentieth century. As a blood-borne virus, this epidemic was fuelled by new parenteral transmission routes associated with medical treatments, immunisation, blood transfusion and more recently injecting drug use. At another level, however, origins might refer to the immediate sources of HCV associated with its pandemic spread, now identified as areas in Central and West sub-Saharan Africa and South and South East Asia where genetically diverse variants of HCV appear to have circulated for hundreds of years. Going back a final step to the actual source of HCV infection in these endemic areas, non-human primates have been long suspected as harbouring viruses related to HCV with potential cross-species transmission of variants corresponding to the 7 main genotypes into humans. Although there is tempting analogy between this and the clearly zoonotic origin of HIV-1 from chimpanzees in Central Africa, no published evidence to date has been obtained for infection of HCV-like viruses in either apes or Old World monkey species. Indeed, a radical rethink of both the host range and host-specificity of hepaciviruses is now required following the very recent findings of a non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV) in horses and potentially in dogs. Further research on a much wider range of mammals is needed to better understand the true genetic diversity of HCV-like viruses and their host ranges in the search for the ultimate origin of HCV in humans.This review is written at a highly significant time in evolutionary studies of HCV and its origins. The discovery of closely related viruses to human HCV in horses and possibly dogs termed non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV) (Burbelo et al. 2012; Kapoor et al. 2011) throws an entirely new light on the species distribution of hepaciviruses and their host range. Despite the significance of these very recent discoveries, however, in many ways it is a particularly difficult time to write a review of HCV origins and evolutionary history. Frequent infection of horses worldwide with a virus reasonably similar to HCV breaks a key assumption of much previous research that the closest relative of HCV would be found in non-human primates. In its place we now have total uncertainty; domestic horses seem an incongruous host species and the suspicion must be that hepaciviruses are much more widely distributed in other mammals. At present, however, we simply do not know what these are. More importantly, we do not know whether viruses more similar to human HCV than NPHV exist and what species these may infect. Discovering a zoonotic source for the epidemic of HCV infection that has swept through the human population in the last century would be a truly important step in our understanding of host relationships, adaptation and pathogenicity.This review of HCV origins therefore concentrates initially on the better characterised recent epidemic transmission of HCV in the twentieth century and the existence of suspected source areas for infection in sub-Saharan Africa and South-East Area. Some aspects of the much less well understood history of HCV before this recent spread will be speculatively discussed, as will the existence of HCV-like viruses in non-human species. Inevitably any comments made about the latter will, through further research, be revealed as either hopelessly cautious or naively overstated in a very short space of time, errors for which I apologise in advance. However, the findings cannot be simply omitted from a review with this title and I hope that they spur a greater interest in the wider group of hepaciviruses and whether the attributes of HCV that make it such an important human pathogen (persistence and hepatotropism) are shared with other members of the genus.

Many viruses such as Hepatitis G (HGV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which also carry a risk of transmission by blood transfusion raise the question of the extent of screening for these pathogens. This work aims to evaluate the prevalence of HGV and EBV in first-time blood donors in Ouagadougou.The prevalence of HGV and EBV in 551 blood donors was 7.4% and 5.4% respectively. HGV prevalence was significantly higher in blood donors with hepatitis B antigens and positive for HCV compared to donors negative for HCV and no hepatitis B antigens (respectively p< 0.001 and p=0.004). EBV prevalence was higher among blood donors of < 20 years age group. HBV and HCV positive individuals are not eligible for blood donation.This study shows significant results with regard to the prevalence of HGV and EBV prevalence in blood donors in Burkina Faso and emphasizes the need for a general screening.

Its transmission has been reported through parenteral, sexual and vertical routes. Unusually for RNA viruses, it exhibits a high degree of conservation of the polyprotein sequence. The geographical distribution of GBV-C suggests an African origin and a long-term co-evolution in the human population but without any known pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to describe the different sub-types of this virus in Southern Cameroon. We studied the genetic epidemiology of GBV-C among rural populations where many HIV-1 and HCV genotypes have been identified. Plasma samples of 345 subjects with evidence of HCV exposure were tested for GBV-C infection. To detect GBV-C RNA, reverse transcription followed by a nested PCR of 5' UTR were performed. Direct sequencing and phylogenetic studies using PHYLIP, PAUP* and SimPlot were carried out. In total, 31 GBV-C RNA-positive samples were detected giving a prevalence of 9.0% among HCV-exposed individuals. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5' UTR showed two distinct clusters: Genotype 1 and Genotype 2. Twenty-eight isolates (8.0%) clustered with Genotype 1 and 3 (1.0%) with Genotype 2. More than one genotype of GBV-C is prevalent in Cameroon of which GBV-C Genotype 1 is more common, confirming reports in the literature. Studying the near full-length genome sequences of GBV-C isolates from primates in this region may provide clues of viral recombination, evolution and origin.

The dog is the main reservoir and vector with wildlife playing a very minor role. No Asian country or region has been declared rabies free by WHO in over two decades and there is evidence of canine rabies spread to new regions during the past 10 years. We now have the knowledge and technology to control canine rabies. The main barrier in managing this costly endemic is lack of motivation by authorities to address this issue along with regional inability of public health and livestock (agriculture) officials to tackle this issue in cooperation and coordination. Rabies is one of the first recognized zoonoses and a model for a true "One Health'' management goal where human; veterinary, and government officials must work together in harmony to defeat this disease.

VACCINE				30	52			7447	7454		10.1016/j.vaccine.2012.10.015				DEC 14 2012	2012	All members of the lyssavirus genus are capable of causing disease that invariably results in death following the development of clinical symptoms. The recent detection of several novel lyssavirus species across the globe, in different animal species, has demonstrated that the lyssavirus genus contains a greater degree of genetic and antigenic variation than previously suspected. The divergence of species within the genus has led to a differentiation of lyssavirus isolates based on both antigenic and genetic data into two, and potentially a third phylogroup. Critically, from both a human and animal health perspective, current rabies vaccines appear able to protect against lyssaviruses classified within phylogroup I. However no protection is afforded against phylogroup II viruses or other more divergent viruses. Here we review current knowledge regarding the diversity and antigenicity of the lyssavirus glycoprotein. We review the degree of cross protection afforded by rabies vaccines, the genetic and antigenic divergence of the lyssaviruses and potential mechanisms for the development of novel lyssavirus vaccines for use in areas where divergent lyssaviruses are known to circulate, as well as for use by those at occupational risk from these pathogens.

Most of these deaths occur in Asia and Africa and are usually the result of dog-mediated rabies. In Europe, the red fox is considered the main reservoir species for wildlife rabies caused by the rabies virus. Besides foxes, bats have also been identified as a reservoir for European bat lyssaviruses in many European countries. Here, the authors present the rabies surveillance data for Europe in recent years, as reported to the WHO Rabies Bulletin Europe.

The relationship between GBV-C and T cell activation in HIV-infected subjects was examined. HIV-infected subjects on cART with non-detectable HIV viral load (VL) or cART naive subjects were studied. GBV-C VL and HIV VL were determined. Cell surface markers of activation (CD38(+)/HLA-DR+), proliferation (Ki-67+), and HIV entry co-receptor expression (CCR5+ and CXCR4+) on total CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and on naive, central memory (CM), effector memory (EM), and effector CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations were measured by flow cytometry. In subjects with suppressed HIV VL, GBV-C was consistently associated with reduced activation in naive, CM, EM, and effector CD4+ cells. GBV-C was associated with reduced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell surface expression of activation and proliferation markers, independent of HIV VL classification. GBV-C was also associated with higher proportions of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, and with lower proportions of EM CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, GBV-C infection was associated with reduced activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in both HIV viremic and HIV RNA suppressed patients. Those with GBV-C infection demonstrated an increased proportion of naive T cells and a reduction in T cell activation and proliferation independent of HIV VL classification, including those with suppressed HIV VL on cART. Since HIV pathogenesis is thought to be accelerated by T cell activation, these results may contribute to prolonged survival among HIV infected individuals co-infected with GBV-C. Furthermore, since cART therapy does not reduce T cell activation to levels seen in HIV-uninfected people, GBV-C infection may be beneficial for HIV-related diseases in those effectively treated with anti-HIV therapy.

Hepatocellular carcinomas in Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs (Sus scrofa)								JOURNAL OF VETERINARY DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATION				24	6			1047	1051		10.1177/1040638712458782				NOV 2012	2012	Various neoplasms have been reported in Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs (Sus scrofa) with few reports of hepatocellular tumors. Twenty-two pot-bellied pigs diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma at necropsy over a 3-year period at one institution are described, representing 29% of the total pot-bellied pigs necropsied. The average age of affected pigs was 16.6 years with 15 males and 7 females. The most common clinical signs were decreased appetite (16/22) and weight loss (7/22). Grossly, the majority were massive tumors (13/22) with fewer nodular tumors (8/22) and 1 diffuse tumor. Massive tumors were typically multilobulated, very large, and encompassing 1 or more adjacent liver lobes, and were soft to firm and tan-yellow to orange-brown. Nodular tumors had multiple, 1-15 cm in diameter, discrete nodules in multiple liver lobes. Gross evidence of abscesses, necrosis, hemorrhage, or cysts associated with the tumor was occasionally described. Half of the cases had possible intrahepatic metastasis, and extrahepatic metastasis was identified in 3 cases, including to the hepatic lymph node (1/3), lung (2/3), spleen (1/3), and kidney (1/3). Histologically, all tumors had a trabecular or solid pattern, or a combination. An adenoid pattern was only identified in small regions of a few tumors. The neoplastic cells were relatively well-differentiated with moderate pleomorphism and a low mitotic index. Other histologic features within the tumors included intracellular glycogen or lipid accumulation, extramedullary hematopoiesis, foci of coagulative necrosis, and bile stasis. Aged pot-bellied pigs can be predisposed to hepatocellular carcinomas, which are locally aggressive and can metastasize within the liver and to other organs.

The virus, a member of the family Paramyxoviridae (genus Henipavirus), is transmitted to horses by pteropid bats (fruit bats or flying foxes), with human infection a result of direct contact with infected horses. Case-fatality rate is high in both horses and people, and so far, more than 60 horses and four people have died from Hendra virus infection in Australia. Human infection is characterised by an acute encephalitic syndrome or relapsing encephalitis, for which no effective treatment is currently available. Recent identification of Hendra virus infection in a domestic animal outside the laboratory setting, and the large range of pteropid bats in Australia, underpins the potential of this virus to cause greater morbidity and mortality in both rural and urban populations and its importance to both veterinary and human health. Attempts at treatment with ribavirin and chloroquine have been unsuccessful. Education, hygiene, and infection control measures have hitherto been the mainstay of prevention, while access to monoclonal antibody treatment and development of an animal vaccine offer further opportunities for disease prevention and control.

We demonstrate here that HCV infection induces autophagy, as judged by accumulation of lipidated LC3-II, and that this induction occurs rapidly after infection, preceding the stimulation of the UPR, which occurs only at later stages, after the viral envelope glycoproteins have been expressed to high levels. Furthermore, both genotype 1b and 2a subgenomic replicons expressing nonstructural (NS3-5B) proteins and JFH-1 virus lacking the envelope glycoproteins potently induced autophagy in the absence of detectable UPR. This ability was also shared by a subgenomic replicon derived from the related GB virus B (GBV-B). We also show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of the key UPR inducer, Ire1, has no effect on HCV genome replication or the induction of autophagy, further demonstrating that the UPR is not required for these processes. Lastly, we demonstrate that the HCV replicase does not colocalize with autophagosomes, suggesting that the induction of autophagy is not required to generate the membrane platform for HCV RNA replication.

Previous studies have revealed that metabolic perturbations are associated with Borna disease viral infection. However, the pathophysiological mechanism underlying its mode of action remains unclear.Methodology: Human oligodendroglia cells infected with the human strain Borna disease virus Hu-H1 and non-infected matched control cells were cultured in vitro. At day 14 post-infection, a proton nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomic approach was used to differentiate the metabonomic profiles of 28 independent intracellular samples from Borna disease virus-infected cells (n = 14) and matched control cells (n = 14). Partial least squares discriminant analysis was performed to demonstrate that the whole metabonomic patterns enabled discrimination between the two groups, and further statistical testing was applied to determine which individual metabolites displayed significant differences between the two groups.Findings: Metabonomic profiling revealed perturbations in 23 metabolites, 19 of which were deemed individually significant: nine energy metabolites (a-glucose, acetate, choline, creatine, formate, myo-inositol, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, pyruvate, succinate) and ten amino acids (aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, threonine, tyrosine, valine). Partial least squares discriminant analysis demonstrated that the whole metabolic patterns enabled statistical discrimination between the two groups.Conclusion: Borna disease viral infection perturbs the metabonomic profiles of several metabolites in human oligodendroglia cells cultured in vitro. The findings suggest that Borna disease virus manipulates the host cell's metabolic network to support viral replication and proliferation.																					WOS:000308462000042	22970281

GB Virus C Envelope Protein E2 Inhibits TCR-Induced IL-2 Production and Alters IL-2-Signaling Pathways								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				189	5			2211	2216		10.4049/jimmunol.1201324				SEP 1 2012	2012	GB virus type C (GBV-C) viremia is associated with reduced CD4(+) T cell expansion following IL-2 therapy and with a reduction in T cell activation in HIV-infected individuals. The mechanism(s) by which GBV-C might alter T cell activation or IL-2 signaling have not been studied. In this study, we assess IL-2 release, IL-2R expression, IL-2 signaling, and cell proliferation in tet-off Jurkat cells expressing the GBV-C envelope glycoprotein (E2) following activation through the TCR. TCR activation was induced by incubation in anti-CD3/CD28 Abs. IL-2 release was measured by ELISA, STAT5 phosphorylation was assessed by immunoblot, and IL-2R alpha (CD25) expression and cell proliferation were determined by flow cytometry. IL-2 and IL-2R alpha steady-state mRNA levels were measured by real-time PCR. GBV-C E2 expression significantly inhibited IL-2 release, CD25 expression, STAT5 phosphorylation, and cellular proliferation in Jurkat cells following activation through the TCR compared with control cell lines. Reducing E2 expression by doxycycline reversed the inhibitory effects observed in the E2-expressing cells. The N-terminal 219 aa of E2 was sufficient to inhibit IL-2 signaling. Addition of purified recombinant GBV-C E2 protein to primary human CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells inhibited TCR activation-induced IL-2 release and upregulation of IL-2R alpha expression. These data provide evidence that the GBV-C E2 protein may contribute to the block in CD4(+) T cell expansion following IL-2 therapy in HIV-infected individuals. Furthermore, the effects of GBV-C on IL-2 and IL-2-signaling pathways may contribute to the reduction in chronic immune activation observed in GBV-C/HIV-coinfected individuals.

The generation of a large sequence database has facilitated studies of the evolution and spread of the virus. Bayesian analyses indicate that currently circulating strains of RVFV are descended from an ancestral species that emerged from a natural reservoir in Africa when large-scale cattle and sheep farming were introduced during the 19th century. Viruses descended from multiple lineages persist in that region, through infection of reservoir animals and vertical transmission in mosquitoes, emerging in years of heavy rainfall to cause epizootics and epidemics. On a number of occasions, viruses from these lineages have been transported outside the enzootic region through the movement of infected animals or mosquitoes, triggering outbreaks in countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mauritania and Madagascar, where RVF had not previously been seen. Such viruses could potentially become established in their new environments through infection of wild and domestic ruminants and other animals and vertical transmission in local mosquito species. Despite their extensive geographic dispersion, all strains of RVFV remain closely related at the nucleotide and amino acid level. The high degree of conservation of genes encoding the virion surface glycoproteins suggests that a single vaccine should protect against all currently circulating RVFV strains. Similarly, preservation of the sequence of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase across viral lineages implies that antiviral drugs targeting the enzyme should be effective against all strains. Researchers should be encouraged to collect additional RVFV isolates and perform whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, so as to enhance our understanding of the continuing evolution of this important virus. This review forms part of a series of invited papers in Antiviral Research on the genetic diversity of emerging viruses. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

All lyssaviruses cause the disease rabies, an acute progressive encephalitis for which, once symptoms occur, there is no effective cure. Currently available vaccines are highly protective against the predominantly circulating lyssavirus species. Using next-generation sequencing technologies, we have obtained the whole-genome sequence for a novel lyssavirus, Ikoma lyssavirus (IKOV), isolated from an African civet in Tanzania displaying clinical signs of rabies. Genetically, this virus is the most divergent within the genus Lyssavirus. Characterization of the genome will help to improve our understanding of lyssavirus diversity and enable investigation into vaccine-induced immunity and protection.

To further characterize E2 effects on HIV replication, stably transfected Jurkat cell lines expressing GBV-C E2 or control sequences were infected with HIV and replication was measured. HIV replication (all 6 isolates studied) was inhibited in all cell lines expressing a region of 17 amino acids of GBV-C E2, but not in cell lines expressing E2 without this region. In contrast, mumps and yellow fever virus replication was not inhibited by E2 protein expression. Synthetic GBV-C E2 17mer peptides did not inhibit HIV replication unless they were fused to a tat-protein-transduction-domain (TAT) for cellular uptake. These data identify the region of CBV-C E2 protein involved in HIV inhibition, and suggest that this GBV-C E2 peptide must gain entry into the cell to inhibit HIV.

Risk factors for bat exposure included age less than or equal to 25 years and owning animals that had been bitten by bats. Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (rVNAs) were detected in 11% (7 of 63) of human sera tested. Rabies virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in the sera of three individuals, two of whom were also seropositive for rVNA. Rabies virus RNP IgM antibodies were detected in one respondent with no evidence of rVNA or RNP IgG antibodies. Because one respondent with positive rVNA results reported prior vaccination and 86% (six of seven) of rVNA-positive respondents reported being bitten by bats, these data suggest nonfatal exposure of persons to rabies virus, which is likely associated with vampire bat depredation.

The finding that CHV is genetically the virus most closely related to hepatitis C virus (HCV) has raised the question of whether HCV might have evolved as the result of close contact between dogs and/or horses and humans. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the NS3/4A serine protease of CHV specifically cleaves human mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) and Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon-beta (TRIF). The proteolytic activity of CHV NS3/4A was evaluated using a bacteriophage lambda genetic screen. Human MAVS- and TRIF-specific cleavage sites were engineered into the lambda cI repressor. Upon infection of Escherichia coli cells coexpressing these repressors and a CHV NS3/4A construct, lambda phage replicated up to 2000-fold more efficiently than in cells expressing a CHV protease variant carrying the inactivating substitution S139A. Comparable results were obtained when several HCV NS3/4A constructs of genotype 1b were assayed. This indicates that CHV can disrupt the human innate antiviral defense signaling pathway and suggests a possible evolutionary relationship between CHV and HCV.

Recent progress in henipavirus research: Molecular biology, genetic diversity, animal models								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				95	2			135	149		10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.05.008				AUG 2012	2012	Nipah and Hendra virus are members of a newly identified genus of emerging paramyxoviruses, the henipaviruses. Both viruses have the ability to cause severe pulmonary infection and severe acute encephalitis. Following their discovery in the 1990s, outbreaks caused by these zoonotic paramyxoviruses have been associated with high public health and especially economic threat potential. Currently, only geographic groupings in Asia and Australia have been described for the henipaviruses. However, while few viral isolates are available and more detailed characterization is necessary, there has been recent evidence that divergent henipaviruses might be present on the African continent. This review endeavours to capture recent advances in the field of henipavirus research, with a focus on genome structure and replication mechanisms, reservoir hosts, genetic diversity, pathogenesis and animal models.

Ian; Kapoor, Amit								Serology-Enabled Discovery of Genetically Diverse Hepaciviruses in a New Host								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				86	11			6171	6178		10.1128/JVI.00250-12				JUN 2012	2012	Genetic and biological characterization of new hepaciviruses infecting animals contributes to our understanding of the ultimate origins of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in humans and dramatically enhances our ability to study its pathogenesis using tractable animal models. Animal homologs of HCV include a recently discovered canine hepacivirus (CHV) and GB virus B (GBV-B), both viruses with largely undetermined natural host ranges. Here we used a versatile serology-based approach to determine the natural host of the only known nonprimate hepacivirus (NPHV), CHV, which is also the closest phylogenetic relative of HCV. Recombinant protein expressed from the helicase domain of CHV NS3 was used as antigen in the luciferase immunoprecipitation system (LIPS) assay to screen several nonprimate animal species. Thirty-six samples from 103 horses were immunoreactive, and viral genomic RNA was present in 8 of the 36 seropositive animals and none of the seronegative animals. Complete genome sequences of these 8 genetically diverse NPHVs showed 14% (range, 6.4% to 17.2%) nucleotide sequence divergence, with most changes occurring at synonymous sites. RNA secondary structure prediction of the 383-base 5' untranslated region of NPHV was refined and extended through mapping of polymorphic sites to unpaired regions or (semi)covariant pairings. Similar approaches were adopted to delineate extensive RNA secondary structures in the coding region of the genome, predicted to form 27 regularly spaced, thermodynamically stable stem-loops. Together, these findings suggest a promising new nonprimate animal model and provide a database that will aid creation of functional NPHV cDNA clones and other novel tools for hepacivirus studies.

Outbreaks of Attacks by Hematophagous Bats in Isolated Riverine Communities in the Brazilian Amazon: A Challenge to Rabies Control								ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH				59	4			272	277		10.1111/j.1863-2378.2011.01444.x				JUN 2012	2012	Human rabies has re-emerged in Latin America due to bat associated transmission. We present data related to attacks by hematophagous bats in three riverine communities in the Rio Negro basin, Brazilian Amazon. A cross-sectional survey was carried out to obtain demographic and epidemiological data through interviews with 201 inhabitants. A total of 721 bat attacks with bites took place from 2004 to 2006, 238 (33%) reported by residents in Campinas do Rio Preto, 329 (46%) in Aguas Vivas and 154 (21%) in the community of Malalaha. Incidence density among surveyed inhabitants was 84 attacks/100 persons-years in Campinas do Rio Preto, 249 attacks/100 persons-years in Aguas Vivas and 81 attacks/100 persons-years in Malalaha. The proportion of surveyed inhabitants bled by bats at least once was 67% (63/94) in Campinas do Rio Preto, 96% (42/44) in Aguas Vivas and 62% (39/63) in Malalaha. Among subjects bled by bats, the average number of bites was 4.6 +/- 4.2 standard deviations (SD) in Campinas do Rio Preto, 8 +/- 6 SD in Aguas Vivas and 4.1 +/- 3.9 SD in Malalaha. Regarding houses, 67% (26/39) had animals in the peridomestic environment (chickens and/or dogs) and all were vulnerable to bats due to gaps in the walls and/or in the windows and doors. In 13 dwellings, rudimentary protection against bats through the fixation of fishing nets and/or straw nets to the windows and other openings was observed. Among dwellers reporting attacks, 48% (68/144) received the full post-exposure anti-rabies vaccination protocol with five doses of diploid human cell vaccine, 28% (39/144) received an incomplete schedule (14 doses), and 26% (37/144) did not receive any dose. No cases of rabies were reported during the study; however, regular pre-exposure vaccination in the studied populations must be considered.																					WOS:000303323200007	22171969

Molecular Inferences Suggest Multiple Host Shifts of Rabies Viruses from Bats to Mesocarnivores in Arizona during 2001-2009								PLOS PATHOGENS				8	6					e1002786	10.1371/journal.ppat.1002786				JUN 2012	2012	In nature, rabies virus (RABV; genus Lyssavirus, family Rhabdoviridae) represents an assemblage of phylogenetic lineages, associated with specific mammalian host species. Although it is generally accepted that RABV evolved originally in bats and further shifted to carnivores, mechanisms of such host shifts are poorly understood, and examples are rarely present in surveillance data. Outbreaks in carnivores caused by a RABV variant, associated with big brown bats, occurred repeatedly during 2001-2009 in the Flagstaff area of Arizona. After each outbreak, extensive control campaigns were undertaken, with no reports of further rabies cases in carnivores for the next several years. However, questions remained whether all outbreaks were caused by a single introduction and further perpetuation of bat RABV in carnivore populations, or each outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of a bat virus. Another question of concern was related to adaptive changes in the RABV genome associated with host shifts. To address these questions, we sequenced and analyzed 66 complete and 20 nearly complete RABV genomes, including those from the Flagstaff area and other similar outbreaks in carnivores, caused by bat RABVs, and representatives of the major RABV lineages circulating in North America and worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that each Flagstaff outbreak was caused by an independent introduction of bat RABV into populations of carnivores. Positive selection analysis confirmed the absence of post-shift changes in RABV genes. In contrast, convergent evolution analysis demonstrated several amino acids in the N, P, G and L proteins, which might be significant for pre-adaptation of bat viruses to cause effective infection in carnivores. The substitution S/T-242 in the viral glycoprotein is of particular merit, as a similar substitution was suggested for pathogenicity of Nishigahara RABV strain. Roles of the amino acid changes, detected in our study, require additional investigations, using reverse genetics and other approaches.																					WOS:000305987800049	22737076

Mammalian venoms form a heterogeneous group having different compositions and modes of action and are present in three classes of mammals, Insectivora, Monotremata, and Chiroptera. A fourth order, Primates, is proposed to have venomous representatives. In this review we highlight recent advances in the field while summarizing biochemical characteristics of these secretions and their effects upon humans and other animals. Historical aspects of venom discovery and evolutionary hypothesis regarding their origin are also discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Marsh, Glenn A.; Wang, Lin-Fa								Hendra and Nipah viruses: why are they so deadly?								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				2	3			242	247		10.1016/j.coviro.2012.03.006				JUN 2012	2012	Henipavirus, including Hendra and Nipah viruses, is a group of emerging bat-borne paramyxoviruses which were responsible for severe disease outbreaks in humans, horses and pigs. The mortality rate of human infection varies between 50 and 100%, making them one of the most deadly viruses known to infect humans. Its use of highly conserved cell surface molecules (ephrin) as entry receptors and its highly effective replication and fusion strategies are believed to be important characteristics responsible for its high pathogenicity. Henipavirus also encodes multiple accessory proteins which play a key role in evasion of host innate immune responses. Our recent study on the mechanism of IFN antagonism by henipaviruses indicated that a better understanding of the virus-host interaction provides great potential to develop new therapeutic strategies against these viruses.

In this study, 48 isolates were selected to further investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of EBLV-1 variants in Germany. The nucleoprotein-gene (N), the nucleoprotein-phosphoprotein spanning untranslated region (NP-UTR) and the UTR between G- and L-gene of each isolate were sequenced using direct cycle sequencing. Results of the subsequent phylogenetic analysis of the N-gene confirmed previous studies on EBLVs, showing a high sequence identity among German EBLV-1a isolates, and a correlation between genetic and temporal and spatial distance, respectively, was shown. Our results indicate that the GL-UTR is not suitable for phylogenetic analyses.Interestingly, 6 nt insertions in two isolates as well as a single nucleotide insertion in a different isolate were detected in the N-P UTR. Within the UTR between G- and L-gene one isolate showed a 35 nt deletion. The effect of those changes on viral properties remains elusive as such mutations have not been described for lyssaviruses before.																					WOS:000304130900013	22712425

Role of GB virus C in modulating HIV disease								EXPERT REVIEW OF ANTI-INFECTIVE THERAPY				10	5			563	572		10.1586/ERI.12.37				MAY 2012	2012	GB virus C (GBV-C) is a member of the Flaviviridae family and the most closely related human virus to HCV. However, GBV-C does not replicate in hepatocytes, but rather in lymphocytes. GBV-C has a worldwide distribution and is transmitted sexually, parenterally and through mother-to-child transmission. Thus, co-infection with HCV and HIV is common. Until now, no human disease has been associated with GBV-C infection. However, there are several reports of a beneficial effect of GBV-C on HIV disease progression in vivo. Different mechanisms to explain these observations have been proposed, including modification of antiviral cytokine production, HIV co-receptor expression, direct inhibition of HIV-1 entry, T-cell activation and Fas-mediated apoptosis. Further understanding of these mechanisms may open new strategies for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.																					WOS:000306354000012	22702320

In a relatively short time since their discoveries in the mid and late 1990s, respectively, a great deal of new information has been accumulated detailing their biology and certain unique characteristics. Their broad species tropism and abilities to cause severe and often fatal respiratory and/or neurologic disease in both animals and humans has sparked considerable interest in developing effective antiviral strategies to prevent or treat henipavirus infection and disease. Here, recent findings on the few most advanced henipavirus countermeasures are summarized and discussed.																					WOS:000312112700011	22482714

TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY				20	3			124	130		10.1016/j.tim.2012.01.004				MAR 2012	2012	GB virus C (GBV-C) is a lymphotropic human virus discovered in 1995 that is related to hepatitis C virus (HCV). GBV-C infection has not been convincingly associated with any disease; however, several studies found an association between persistent GBV-C infection and improved survival in HIV-positive individuals. GBV-C infection modestly alters T cell homeostasis in vivo through various mechanisms, including modulation of chemokine and cytokine release and receptor expression, and by diminution of T cell activation, proliferation and apoptosis, all of which may contribute to improved HIV clinical outcomes. In vitro studies confirm these clinical observations and demonstrate an anti-HIV replication effect of GBV-C. This review summarizes existing data on potential mechanisms by which GBV-C interferes with HIV, and the research needed to capitalize on this epidemiological observation.

Favorable clinical course and reduced mortality among HIV-infected patients was demonstrated by several studies with patients co-infected with the GB virus C (GBV-C). This potential benefit of GBV-C has been demonstrated in the pre-HAART and post-HAART eras; however, this effect was not observed in all studies and the discrepancy may be due to changes during the course of HIV infection, characteristic of the cohort, and the degree of therapeutic response. The GBV-C has been found to decrease HIV replication in in vitro models, highlighting the interference of persistent GBV- C viremia. The mechanism of the beneficial effect of GBV- C appears to be mediated by changes in the cellular immune response, and elucidation of putative protective effects of GBV- C in HIV co-infection could potentially identify novel targets for anti-HIV agents.

J	Riedel, Christiane; Lamp, Benjamin; Heimann, Manuela; Koenig, Matthias; Blome, Sandra; Moennig, Volker; Schuettler, Christian; Thiel, Heinz-Juergen; Ruemenapf, Tillmann								The Core Protein of Classical Swine Fever Virus Is Dispensable for Virus Propagation In Vitro								PLOS PATHOGENS				8	3					e1002598	10.1371/journal.ppat.1002598				MAR 2012	2012	Core protein of Flaviviridae is regarded as essential factor for nucleocapsid formation. Yet, core protein is not encoded by all isolates (GBV- A and GBV- C). Pestiviruses are a genus within the family Flaviviridae that affect cloven-hoofed animals, causing economically important diseases like classical swine fever (CSF) and bovine viral diarrhea (BVD). Recent findings describe the ability of NS3 of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) to compensate for disabling size increase of core protein (Riedel et al., 2010). NS3 is a nonstructural protein possessing protease, helicase and NTPase activity and a key player in virus replication. A role of NS3 in particle morphogenesis has also been described for other members of the Flaviviridae (Patkar et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2008). These findings raise questions about the necessity and function of core protein and the role of NS3 in particle assembly. A reverse genetic system for CSFV was employed to generate poorly growing CSFVs by modification of the core gene. After passaging, rescued viruses had acquired single amino acid substitutions (SAAS) within NS3 helicase subdomain 3. Upon introduction of these SAAS in a nonviable CSFV with deletion of almost the entire core gene (Vp447(Delta c)), virus could be rescued. Further characterization of this virus with regard to its physical properties, morphology and behavior in cell culture did not reveal major differences between wildtype (Vp447) and Vp447(Delta c). Upon infection of the natural host, Vp447(Delta c) was attenuated. Hence we conclude that core protein is not essential for particle assembly of a core-encoding member of the Flaviviridae, but important for its virulence. This raises questions about capsid structure and necessity, the role of NS3 in particle assembly and the function of core protein in general.																					WOS:000302225600046	22457622

EAdV-1 is predominantly associated with upper respiratory tract infections while EAdV-2 appears to be associated with gastrointestinal infections in horses. In this report the EAdV-1 genome has been sequenced for the first time. The EAdV-1 genome encoded genes are characteristic of the Mastadenovirus genus such as protein V and IX. Unexpectedly, phylogenetic reconstructions also revealed a close relationship between EAdV-1 and two recently characterized bat adenoviruses. The results of this study suggest that EAdV-1 may share a common ancestor with canine and bat adenoviruses. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SHW-7A11 reacted with nonstructural protein 1 in Western blot analysis. SHW-7A11 was relatively specific for the WNV strain NY99 and recognized Kunjin and Eg101 strains in indirect ELISAs. Two c-ELISAs were developed for sera diluted 10 and 100 times and named c-ELISA10 and c-ELISA100, respectively. Both c-ELISAs detected antibodies against WNV NY99 and Kunjin strains. Little cross-reactivity was observed for antibodies against Japanese encephalitis virus and St. Louis encephalitis virus in these assays. Using the cutoff point for the St. Louis encephalitis virus, all WNV-infected chickens were found to be positive on day 21 after infection in both c-ELISAs. On the other hand, all infected chickens were found to be positive on day 35 after infection in a virus neutralization test. Our newly developed SHW-7A11-based c-ELISA can detect WNV infection with sera diluted 10 to 100 times. Therefore, this c-ELISA can be used for WNV serosurveillance of chickens and wild birds.																					WOS:000300044800021	22190400

Since all other GB viruses to date form monophyletic groups according to their host species, the close relationship between the sequences generated from camel sera and human GBV-C isolates seemed implausible, leading us to conduct an independent analysis of the sequences. Our investigation found three lines of evidence arguing against GBV-C infection in dromedary camels. First, strong evidence of artifactual sequence generation was identified for some of the sequences. Secondly, the sequence diversity within individual camel sera was 10-152-fold greater than that described for GBV-C within a human host. Finally. GBV-C sequences generated from each camel shared near complete identity with human isolates previously described by the same laboratory. Taken together, these data strongly suggest laboratory contamination. We suggest that additional validation experiments are needed before it is possible to conclude that camels are permissive for GBV-C infection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Henipavirus Neutralising Antibodies in an Isolated Island Population of African Fruit Bats								PLOS ONE				7	1					e30346	10.1371/journal.pone.0030346				JAN 12 2012	2012	Isolated islands provide valuable opportunities to study the persistence of viruses in wildlife populations, including population size thresholds such as the critical community size. The straw-coloured fruit bat, Eidolon helvum, has been identified as a reservoir for henipaviruses (serological evidence) and Lagos bat virus (LBV; virus isolation and serological evidence) in continental Africa. Here, we sampled from a remote population of E. helvum annobonensis fruit bats on Annobon island in the Gulf of Guinea to investigate whether antibodies to these viruses also exist in this isolated subspecies. Henipavirus serological analyses (Luminex multiplexed binding and inhibition assays, virus neutralisation tests and western blots) and lyssavirus serological analyses (LBV: modified Fluorescent Antibody Virus Neutralisation test, LBV and Mokola virus: lentivirus pseudovirus neutralisation assay) were undertaken on 73 and 70 samples respectively. Given the isolation of fruit bats on Annobon and their lack of connectivity with other populations, it was expected that the population size on the island would be too small to allow persistence of viruses that are thought to cause acute and immunising infections. However, the presence of antibodies against henipaviruses was detected using the Luminex binding assay and confirmed using alternative assays. Neutralising antibodies to LBV were detected in one bat using both assays. We demonstrate clear evidence for exposure of multiple individuals to henipaviruses in this remote population of E. helvum annobonensis fruit bats on Annobon island. The situation is less clear for LBV. Seroprevalences to henipaviruses and LBV in Annobon are notably different to those in E. helvum in continental locations studied using the same sampling techniques and assays. Whilst cross-sectional serological studies in wildlife populations cannot provide details on viral dynamics within populations, valuable information on the presence or absence of viruses may be obtained and utilised for informing future studies.

Anti-rabies prophylaxis was applied to 51.56% of all vaccinated patients exposed to dogs and to 20.06% exposed to cats. Rabies was confirmed mainly in domestic animals (2 cats, 1 dog). Among wild animals, only 1 case of rabies was confirmed in a single bat.																					WOS:000305931700019	22742801

Since their respective initial outbreaks in 1998 and 1994, they have continued to cause sporadic outbreaks resulting in fatal disease. Due to their designation as Biosafety Level 4 pathogens, the level of containment required to work with live henipaviruses is available only to select laboratories around the world. This chapter provides an overview of the molecular virology of NiV and HeV including comparisons to other, well-characterized paramyxoviruses.

Domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) are closely related to humans in terms of anatomy, genetics and physiology, and represent an excellent animal model to study various microbial infectious diseases. Indeed, experiments in pigs are much more likely to be predictive of therapeutic treatments in humans than experiments in rodents. In this review, we highlight the numerous advantages of the pig model for infectious disease research and vaccine development and document a few examples of human microbial infectious diseases for which the use of pigs as animal models has contributed to the acquisition of new knowledge to improve both animal and human health.

Both viruses emerged from their natural reservoir during the last decade of the twentieth century, causing severe disease in humans, horses and swine, and infecting a number of other mammalian species. The current review summarizes our up to date understanding of pathology and pathogenesis in the natural reservoir species, the Pteropus bat, and in the equine and porcine spill over species.

The molecular interplay between host factors and invading viruses is a continuous coevolutionary process that determines viral host range and pathogenesis. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a strictly human pathogen, causing chronic liver injuries accompanied by lipid disorders. Upon infection, in addition to protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions usual for such a positive-strand RNA virus, HCV relies on protein-lipid interactions at multiple steps of its life cycle to establish persistent infection, making use of hepatic lipid pathways. This paper focuses on lipoproteins in HCV entry and on receptors and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism that HCV exploits to enter hepatocytes.																					WOS:000215853100076	24278733

It is increasingly recognized that LDs interact extensively with other organelles and that they perform functions beyond passive lipid storage and lipid homeostasis. One emerging function for LDs is the coordination of immune responses, as these organelles participate in the generation of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are important inflammation mediators. Similarly, LDs are also beginning to be recognized as playing a role in interferon responses and in antigen cross presentation. Not surprisingly, there is emerging evidence that many pathogens, including hepatitis C and Dengue viruses, Chlamydia, and Mycobacterium, target LDs during infection either for nutritional purposes or as part of an anti-immunity strategy. We here review recent findings that link LDs to the regulation and execution of immune responses in the context of host-pathogen interactions.																					WOS:000310224200017	22578141

The clinical manifestations may be mild, but if severe, includes acute encephalitic and pulmonary syndromes with a high mortality. The pathological features in human acute henipavirus infections comprise vasculopathy (vasculitis, endothelial multinucleated syncytia, thrombosis), microinfarcts and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system, lung, kidney and other major organs. Viral inclusions, antigens, nucleocapsids and RNA are readily demonstrated in blood vessel wall and numerous types of parenchymal cells. Relapsing henipavirus encephalitis is a rare complication reported in less than 10% of survivors of the acute infection and appears to be distinct from the acute encephalitic syndrome. Pathological evidence suggests viral recrudescence confined to the central nervous system as the cause.																					WOS:000330362500008	22427144	
J	Rupprecht, Charles E.; Turmelle, Amy; Kuzmin, Ivan V.								A perspective on lyssavirus emergence and perpetuation								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				1	6			662	670		10.1016/j.coviro.2011.10.014				DEC 2011	2011	Rabies is propagated globally by viruses in the Family Rhabdoviridae, Genus Lyssavirus. These RNA viruses utilize the mammalian central nervous system as their ultimate niche, and exploit routine social mechanisms, as well as host behavioral alterations, to facilitate transmission by neural transport and innervations of the salivary glands, and ultimately excretion via the saliva, towards circulation thereafter in host populations. All mammals are susceptible to infection, but lyssavirus reservoirs are represented by several species of Carnivore, with viral global diversity and distribution in toto driven by a wide variety of the Chiroptera. Pathogen diversity is maintained by multiple faunas, and facilitated by pronounced host vagility, as exemplified by the ease of routine daily and seasonal movements by bats. Viral 'ensembles', or subpopulations associated with productive transmission events, emerge locally in vivo through a combination of naive host infections in some individuals versus acquired immunity by others, using complex metapopulation dynamics. Enhanced surveillance, improved diagnostics, increased pathogen detection, and an integrated One Health approach, targeting human, domestic animal and wildlife interfaces, provide modern insights to the ecology of bat lyssaviruses to augment future prevention and control.

It has been suspected that bats might have evolved particularly effective mechanisms to suppress viral replication. Here, we investigated interferon (IFN) response, -induction, -secretion and -signaling in epithelial-like cells of the relevant and abundant African fruit bat species, Eidolon helvum (E. helvum). Immortalized cell lines were generated; their potential to induce and react on IFN was confirmed, and biological assays were adapted to application in bat cell cultures, enabling comparison of landmark IFN properties with that of common mammalian cell lines. E. helvum cells were fully capable of reacting to viral and artificial IFN stimuli. E. helvum cells showed highest IFN mRNA induction, highly productive IFN protein secretion, and evidence of efficient IFN stimulated gene induction. In an Alphavirus infection model, O'nyong-nyong virus exhibited strong IFN induction but evaded the IFN response by translational rather than transcriptional shutoff, similar to other Alphavirus infections. These novel IFN-competent cell lines will allow comparative research on zoonotic, bat-borne viruses in order to model mechanisms of viral maintenance and emergence in bat reservoirs.

The enigmatic genome of Chara australis virus								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				92				2679	2690		10.1099/vir.0.033852-0				NOV 2011	2011	Most of the genomic sequence of Chara australis virus (CAV), previously called Chara corallina virus, has been determined. It is a ssRNA molecule of 9065 nt with at least four ORFs. At its 5' end is an ORF encoding a protein of 227 kDa, distantly homologous to the multifunctional replicases of benyviruses and rubiviruses. Next is an ORF encoding a protein of 44 kDa, homologous to the helicases of pestiviruses. The third ORF encodes an unmatched protein of 38 kDa that is probably a movement protein. The fourth and 3'-terminal ORF encodes a protein of 17.7 kDa homologous to the coat proteins of tobamoviruses. The short methyltransferase region of the CAV replicase matches only the C-terminal motif of benyvirus methyltransferases. This and other clues indicate that approximately 11 % and 2 % of the 5' and 3' termini of the complete CAV genome, respectively, are missing from the sequence. The aligned amino acid sequences of the CAV proteins and their nearest homologues contain many gaps but relationships inferred from them were little affected by removal of these gaps. Sequence comparisons show that three of the CAV genes may have diverged from the most closely related genes of other viruses 250-450 million years ago, and the sister relationship between the genes of CAV and those of benyviruses and tobamoviruses, mirroring the ancient sister relationship between charophytes (i.e. the algal host of CAV) and embryophytes (i.e. the plant hosts of tobamoviruses and benyviruses), is congruent with this possibility.

Some viruses may have co-evolved with human populations for tens of thousands of years, or even with our primate ancestors over many millions of years. However, calibrations of the rate of short-term virus evolution lead to estimates of dates for viral ancestors that are orders of magnitude more recent, and a number of the proposed host-virus co-divergence scenarios have been questioned. Other considerations indicate that the proposed recent timescales for virus evolution are implausible, that co-divergence has been rejected prematurely, and that long-term evolutionary rates are very much slower than short-term rates. There is a need to understand the biological basis of this discrepancy and to develop evolutionary models that can accommodate this.																					WOS:000312112400018	22440848

A universal real-time assay for the detection of Lyssaviruses								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS				177	1			87	93		10.1016/j.jviromet.2011.07.002				OCT 2011	2011	Rabies virus (RABV) is enzootic throughout most of the world. It is now widely accepted that RABV had its origins in bats. Ten of the 11 Lyssavirus species recognised, including RABV, have been isolated from bats. There is, however, a lack of understanding regarding both the ecology and host reservoirs of Lyssaviruses. A real-time PCR assay for the detection of all Lyssaviruses using universal primers would be beneficial for Lyssavirus surveillance. It was shown that using SYBR (R) Green, a universal real-time PCR primer pair previously demonstrated to detect European bat Lyssaviruses 1 and 2, and RABV, was able to detect reverse transcribed RNA for each of the seven virus species available to us. Target sequences of bat derived virus species unavailable for analysis were synthesized to produce oligonucleotides. Lagos Bat-, Duvenhage- and Mokola virus full nucleoprotein gene clones enabled a limit of 5-50 plasmid copies to be detected. Five copies of each of the synthetic DNA oligonucleotides of Aravan-, Khujand-, Irkut-, West Caucasian bat- and Shimoni bat virus were detected. The single universal primer pair was therefore able to detect each of the most divergent known Lyssaviruses with great sensitivity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The density of vampire bats was investigated based on percentage of captures during control of Desmodus rotundus samplings and during bat diversity research. In the present work, 203 individuals of D. rotundus were captured from 1993 to 2009, which corresponds to 11.88% of all bat captures carried out for species control in local villages and 1.58% of all captures in faunistic inventories. The density of D. rotundus is high even on the recently occupied islands where domestic animals have been introduced. It is probable that this species dispersed from the continent to the islands due to the introduction of domestic animals.																					WOS:000294437100020	21881799

Little is known about the mechanisms that govern the development of respiratory and neurological disease. Using a hamster model of lethal NiV and HeV infection, we describe the role of the route and dose of infection on the clinical outcome and determine virus tropism and host responses following infection. Infection of hamster with a high dose of NiV or HeV resulted in acute respiratory distress. NiV initially replicated in the upper respiratory tract epithelium, whereas HeV initiated infection primarily in the interstitium. In contrast, infection with a low dose of NiV or HeV resulted in the development of neurological signs and more systemic spread of the virus through involvement of the endothelium. The development of neurological signs coincided with disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and expression of tumor necrosis alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). In addition, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) was identified as playing an important role in NiV and HeV pathogenesis. These studies reveal novel information on the development and progression of NiV and HeV clinical disease, provide a mechanism for the differences in transmission observed between NiV and HeV outbreaks, and identify specific cytokines and chemokines that serve as important targets for treatment.

Although HCV was discovered more than 20 y ago, its origin remains obscure largely because no closely related animal virus homolog has been identified; furthermore, efforts to understand HCV pathogenesis have been hampered by the absence of animal models other than chimpanzees for human disease. Here we report the identification in domestic dogs of a nonprimate hepacivirus. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the canine hepacivirus (CHV) confirmed it to be the most genetically similar animal virus homolog of HCV. Bayesian Markov chains Monte Carlo and associated time to most recent common ancestor analyses suggest a mean recent divergence time of CHV and HCV clades within the past 500-1,000 y, well after the domestication of canines. The discovery of CHV may provide new insights into the origin and evolution of HCV and a tractable model system with which to probe the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of diseases caused by hepacivirus infection.

Frequency and genotypic distribution of GB virus C (GBV-C) among Colombian population with Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) infection								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				8						345	10.1186/1743-422X-8-345				JUL 11 2011	2011	Background: GB virus C (GBV-C) is an enveloped positive-sense ssRNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. Studies on the genetic variability of the GBV-C reveals the existence of six genotypes: genotype 1 predominates in West Africa, genotype 2 in Europe and America, genotype 3 in Asia, genotype 4 in Southwest Asia, genotype 5 in South Africa and genotype 6 in Indonesia. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and genotypic distribution of GBV-C in the Colombian population.Methods: Two groups were analyzed: i) 408 Colombian blood donors infected with HCV (n = 250) and HBV (n = 158) from Bogota and ii) 99 indigenous people with HBV infection from Leticia, Amazonas. A fragment of 344 bp from the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) was amplified by nested RT PCR. Viral sequences were genotyped by phylogenetic analysis using reference sequences from each genotype obtained from GenBank (n = 160). Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to obtain the MCC tree using BEAST v. 1.5.3.Results: Among blood donors, from 158 HBsAg positive samples, eight 5.06% (n = 8) were positive for GBV-C and from 250 anti-HCV positive samples, 3.2%(n = 8) were positive for GBV-C. Also, 7.7% (n = 7) GBV-C positive samples were found among indigenous people from Leticia. A phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of the following GBV-C genotypes among blood donors: 2a (41.6%), 1 (33.3%), 3 (16.6%) and 2b (8.3%). All genotype 1 sequences were found in co-infection with HBV and 4/5 sequences genotype 2a were found in co-infection with HCV. All sequences from indigenous people from Leticia were classified as genotype 3. The presence of GBV-C infection was not correlated with the sex (p = 0.43), age (p = 0.38) or origin (p = 0.17).Conclusions: It was found a high frequency of GBV-C genotype 1 and 2 in blood donors. The presence of genotype 3 in indigenous population was previously reported from Santa Marta region in Colombia and in native people from Venezuela and Bolivia. This fact may be correlated to the ancient movements of Asian people to South America a long time ago.																					WOS:000293079500001	21745373

Quantifying the Phylodynamic Forces Driving Papillomavirus Evolution								MOLECULAR BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				28	7			2101	2113		10.1093/molbev/msr030				JUL 2011	2011	The associations between pathogens and their hosts are complex and can result from a variety of evolutionary processes including codivergence, lateral transfer, or duplication. Papillomaviruses (PVs) are double-stranded DNA viruses ubiquitously present in mammals and are a suitable target for rigorous statistical tests of potential virus-host codivergence. We analyze the evolutionary dynamics of PV diversification by comparing robust phylogenies of PVs and their respective hosts using different statistical approaches to assess topological and branch-length congruence. Mammalian PVs segregated into four diverse major clades that overlapped to varying degrees in terms of their mammalian host lineages. The hypothesis that PVs and hosts evolved independently was globally rejected (P = 0.0001), although only 90 of 207 virus-host associations (43%) were significant in individual tests. Virus-host codivergence accounted roughly for one-third of the evolutionary events required to reconcile PV-host evolutionary histories. When virus-host associations were analyzed locally within each of the four viral clades, numerous independent topological congruencies were identified that were incompatible with respect to the global trees. These results support an evolutionary scenario in which early PV radiation was followed by independent codivergence between viruses within each of the major clades and their hosts. Moreover, heterogeneous groups of closely related PVs infecting non-related hosts suggest several interspecies transmission events. Our results argue thus for the importance of alternative events in PV evolution, in contrast to the prevailing opinion that these viruses show a high degree of host specificity and codivergence.

We have recently demonstrated that resident CNS cells express high-affinity receptors for this neuropeptide (neurokinin-1 receptors [NK-1R]), and we have shown that SP can significantly augment glial inflammatory responses to clinically relevant Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, we provided evidence that endogenous SP/NK-1R interactions are an essential component in the initiation and/or progression of CNS inflammation following in vivo exposure to these pathogens. In this study, we demonstrate that SP similarly enhances inflammatory glial responses to the major Gram-positive causative agent of bacterial meningitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and show that endogenous SP/NK-1R interactions play a critical role in the development of CNS inflammation in an in vivo model of pneumococcal meningitis. Importantly, we provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that pharmacological targeting of the NK-1R not only prevents the development of damaging inflammation when administered prophylactically, but can also limit or reverse neuroinflammation associated with an established streptococcal CNS infection when delivered therapeutically. We show that an NK-1R antagonist attenuates increases in CNS inflammatory cytokine levels and decreases in immunosuppressive cytokine production associated with an ongoing S. pneumoniae infection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a therapeutic intervention reverses infection-associated gliosis and demyelination in the absence of changes in CNS bacterial burden. Together, these results suggest that targeting SP/NK-1R interactions is a strategy worthy of further study for the treatment of microbially induced neuroinflammation.

Since its introduction in 1999 into the United States, it became a concerned pathogen for wild bird populations, because of massive bird deaths events and significant bird population declines. By 2001 the virus has reached countries in South America, Central America and the Caribbean. The true role of this virus as pathogen for wild birds there is unknown, mainly due to the lack of active surveillance systems. Notwithstanding, there is no epizootic event reported yet, in contrast with the epidemiological behaviour of the virus in the United States. In Argentina, its ecoepidemiology is mostly unknown and it has received little attention from ornithologists. There are reports of viral isolations from dead equines, encephalitis and febrile human cases, as well as neutralizing antibodies detections in wild birds in central and northern provinces. In this review we provide an updated analysis regarding the ecoepidemiology of West Nile virus, and we give basic insights related to basic virological and epidemiological concepts in order to call the attention of ornithologists on the relationship between pathogens and bird conservation. Stronger support on interdisciplinary scientific projects is necessary to provide insight into the biology, ecology and epidemiology of this new viral pathogen in the American continent.

J	Vigant, Frederic; Lee, Benhur								Hendra and Nipah Infection: Pathology, Models and Potential Therapies								Infectious Disorders - Drug Targets				11	3			315	336						JUN 2011	2011	The Paramyxoviridae family comprises of several genera that contain emerging or re-emerging threats for human and animal health with no real specific effective treatment available. Hendra and Nipah virus are members of a newly identified genus of emerging paramyxoviruses, Henipavirus. Since their discovery in the 1990s, henipaviruses outbreaks have been associated with high economic and public health threat potential. When compared to other paramyxoviruses, henipaviruses appear to have unique characteristics. Henipaviruses are zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a broader tropism than most other paramyxoviruses, and can cause severe acute encephalitis with unique features among viral encephalitides. There are currently no approved effective prophylactic or therapeutic treatments for henipavirus infections. Although ribavirin was empirically used and seemed beneficial during the biggest outbreak caused by one of these viruses, the Nipah virus, its efficacy is disputed in light of its lack of efficacy in several animal models of henipavirus infection. Nevertheless, because of its highly pathogenic nature, much effort has been spent in developing anti-henipavirus therapeutics. In this review we describe the unique features of henipavirus infections and the different strategies and animal models that have been developed so far in order to identify and test potential drugs to prevent or treat henipavirus infections. Some of these components have the potential to be broad-spectrum antivirals as they target effectors of viral pathogenecity common to other viruses.

J	Wang, Yao E.; Park, Arnold; Lake, Michael; Pentecost, Mickey; Torres, Betsabe; Yun, Tatyana E.; Wolf, Mike C.; Holbrook, Michael R.; Freiberg, Alexander N.; Lee, Benhur								Ubiquitin-Regulated Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Trafficking of the Nipah Virus Matrix Protein Is Important for Viral Budding								PLOS PATHOGENS				6	11					e1001186	10.1371/journal.ppat.1001186				NOV 2010	2010	Paramyxoviruses are known to replicate in the cytoplasm and bud from the plasma membrane. Matrix is the major structural protein in paramyxoviruses that mediates viral assembly and budding. Curiously, the matrix proteins of a few paramyxoviruses have been found in the nucleus, although the biological function associated with this nuclear localization remains obscure. We report here that the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the Nipah virus matrix (NiV-M) protein and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated virus budding. Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans, and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (BSL4) pathogen. During live NiV infection, NiV-M was first detected in the nucleus at early stages of infection before subsequent localization to the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) and the leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) found in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and also abolished NiV-M budding. A highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: its positive charge was important for mediating nuclear import, and it was also a potential site for monoubiquitination which regulates nuclear export of the protein. Concordantly, overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding whereas depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell (via proteasome inhibitors) resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding. Live Nipah virus budding was exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors: bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor for treating multiple myeloma, reduced viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, which is 100-fold less than the peak plasma concentration that can be achieved in humans. This opens up the possibility of using an "off-the-shelf'' therapeutic against acute NiV infection.																					WOS:000284586300020	21085610

A Novel Model of Lethal Hendra Virus Infection in African Green Monkeys and the Effectiveness of Ribavirin Treatment								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				84	19			9831	9839		10.1128/JVI.01163-10				OCT 2010	2010	The henipaviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), are emerging zoonotic paramyxoviruses that can cause severe and often lethal neurologic and/or respiratory disease in a wide variety of mammalian hosts, including humans. There are presently no licensed vaccines or treatment options approved for human or veterinarian use. Guinea pigs, hamsters, cats, and ferrets, have been evaluated as animal models of human HeV infection, but studies in nonhuman primates (NHP) have not been reported, and the development and approval of any vaccine or antiviral for human use will likely require efficacy studies in an NHP model. Here, we examined the pathogenesis of HeV in the African green monkey (AGM) following intratracheal inoculation. Exposure of AGMs to HeV produced a uniformly lethal infection, and the observed clinical signs and pathology were highly consistent with HeV-mediated disease seen in humans. Ribavirin has been used to treat patients infected with either HeV or NiV; however, its utility in improving outcome remains, at best, uncertain. We examined the antiviral effect of ribavirin in a cohort of nine AGMs before or after exposure to HeV. Ribavirin treatment delayed disease onset by 1 to 2 days, with no significant benefit for disease progression and outcome. Together our findings introduce a new disease model of acute HeV infection suitable for testing antiviral strategies and also demonstrate that, while ribavirin may have some antiviral activity against the henipaviruses, its use as an effective standalone therapy for HeV infection is questionable.

J	Rackova, Sylva; Janu, Lubos; Kabickova, Hana								Borna disease virus (BDV) circulating immunocomplex positivity in addicted patients in the Czech Republic: a prospective cohort analysis								BMC PSYCHIATRY				10						70	10.1186/1471-244X-10-70				SEP 8 2010	2010	Background: Borna disease virus (BDV) is an RNA virus belonging to the family Bornaviridae. Borna disease virus is a neurotropic virus that causes changes in mood, behaviour and cognition. BDV causes persistent infection of the central nervous system. Immune changes lead to activation of infection. Alcohol and drug dependence are associated with immune impairment.Methods: We examined the seropositivity of BDV circulating immunocomplexes (CIC) in patients with alcohol and drug dependence and healthy individuals (blood donors). We examined 41 addicted patients for the presence of BDV CIC in the serum by ELISA at the beginning of detoxification, and after eight weeks of abstinence. This is the first such study performed in patients with alcohol and drug dependence.Results: BDV CIC positivity was detected in 36.59% of addicted patients on day 0 and in 42.86% on day 56. The control group was 37.3% positive. However, we did not detect higher BDV CIC positivity in addicted patients in comparison with blood donors (p = 0.179). The significantly higher level of BDV CIC was associated with lower levels of GGT (gamma glutamyl transferase) (p = 0.027) and approached statistical significance with the lower age of addicted patients (p = 0.064). We did not find any association between BDV CIC positivity and other anamnestic and demographic characteristics.Conclusions: In our study addicted patients did not have significantly higher levels of BDV CIC than the control group. The highest levels of BDV CIC were detected in patients with lower levels of GGT and a lower age.Trial registration: This study was approved by the ethical committee of the University Hospital Medical Faculty of Charles University in Pilsen, Czech Republic (registration number 303/ 2001).

J	Williamson, M. M.; Torres-Velez, F. J.								Henipavirus: A Review of Laboratory Animal Pathology								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				47	5			871	880		10.1177/0300985810378648				SEP 2010	2010	The genus Henipavirus contains two members-Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV)-and each can cause fatal disease in humans and animals. HeV and Niv are currently classified as biosafety level 4, and NiV is classified as a category C priority pathogen. The aim of this article is to discuss the pathology of laboratory animal models of henipavirus infection and to assess their suitability as animal models for the development and testing of human therapeutics and vaccines. There has been considerable progress in the development of animal models for henipavirus disease. Suitable animal models include the golden hamster, ferrets, cats, and pigs, which develop disease resembling that observed in humans. Guinea pigs are a less reliable model for henipavirus disease, but they do develop henipavirus-induced encephalitis. Because human efficacy studies with henipaviruses are not permitted, animal studies are critical for the development of antiviral therapeutics and vaccines. Current research indicates that passive immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies is protective of ferrets against NiV infection and that passive immunotherapy using NiV antibodies protects hamsters from HeV. Recombinant vaccines have been used to protect cats and pigs against NiV infection. Ribavirin and 6-aza-uridine were able to delay but not prevent NiV-induced mortality in hamsters. Further research is needed to develop a model and therapy for late-onset henipavirus encephalitis.																					WOS:000283798900010	20682803	
J	Li, Mingyi; Embury-Hyatt, Carissa; Weingartl, Hana M.								Experimental inoculation study indicates swine as a potential host for Hendra virus								VETERINARY RESEARCH				41	3					33	10.1051/vetres/2010005				MAY-JUN 2010	2010	Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic virus from the family Paramyxoviridae causing fatal disease in humans and horses. Five-week-old Landrace pigs and 5-month-old Gottingen minipigs were inoculated with approximately 10(7) plaque forming units per animal. In addition to fever and depression exhibited in all infected pigs, one of the two Landrace pigs developed respiratory signs at 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) and one of the Gottingen minipigs developed respiratory signs at 5 dpi and mild neurological signs at 7 dpi. Virus was detected in all infected pigs at 2-5 dpi from oral, nasal, and rectal swabs and at 3-5 dpi from ocular swabs by real-time RT-PCR targeting the HeV M gene. Virus titers in nasal swab samples were as high as 10(4.6) TCID50/mL. The viral RNA was mainly distributed in tissues from respiratory and lymphoid systems at an early stage of infection and the presence of virus was confirmed by virus isolation. Pathological changes and immunohistochemical staining for viral antigen were consistent with the tissue distribution of the virus. This new finding indicates that pigs are susceptible to HeV infections and could potentially play a role as an intermediate host in transmission to humans.

In contrast to other paramyxoviruses NiV infects many mammalian species. Because of its zoonotic potential, the high pathogenicity and the lack of therapeutic treatment, NiV was classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. In humans NiV causes a severe acute encephalitis whereas in some animal hosts respiratory symptoms are predominantly observed. Despite the differences in the clinical outcome, microvascular endothelial cell damage predominantly underlies the pathological changes in NiV infections in all susceptible host species. NiV generally induces a pronounced vasculitis which is primarily characterised by endothelial cell necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration. For future developments of specific antiviral therapies or vaccines, a detailed understanding of the molecular basis of NiV pathogenesis is required. This article reviews the current knowledge about natural and experimental infections in different mammals, focusing on the main organ and cell tropism in vivo, and summarises some recent studies in cell culture on the role of ephrin-B2 and -B3 receptors in NiV infection of endothelial cells.

In contrast to other viral fusion proteins with monobasic cleavage sites, processing of NiV F proteins with one single basic amino acid in the cleavage peptide by exogenous trypsin is very inefficient, and introduction of a consensus sequence for furin does not result in cleavage by this ubiquitous protease. In contrast, a multibasic cleavage peptide in the NiV F protein completely impairs proteolytic processing and the generation of biological activity. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The vaccine consisted of a recombinant envelope (E) protein truncated at the C-terminal end, resulting in a polypeptide containing 80% of the N-terminal amino acids of the native WNV protein (WN-80E), mixed with an adjuvant (GPI-0100). WN-80E was produced in a Drosophila melanogaster expression system with high yield and purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using a monoclonal antibody specific for flavivirus E proteins. Groups of monkeys were vaccinated with formulations containing 1 or 25 mu g of WN-80E antigen, and both humoral and cellular immunity were assessed after vaccination. The results demonstrated potent antibody responses to vaccination, as determined by both enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and virus-neutralizing antibody assays. All vaccinated animals responded favorably, and there was little difference in response between animals immunized with 1 or 25 mu g of WN-80E. Cellular immunity was determined by lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production assays using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated animals stimulated in vitro with WN-80E. Cell-mediated immune responses varied from animal to animal within each group. About half of the animals responded with lymphoproliferation, cytokine production, or both. Again, there was little difference in response between animals immunized with a 1- or 25-mu g dose of WN-80E in the vaccine formulations. In a separate experiment, groups of monkeys were immunized with the WN-80E/GPI-0100 vaccine or an adjuvant-only control formulation. Animals were then challenged by inoculation of wild-type WNV, and the level of viremia in each animal was monitored daily for 10 days. The results showed that whereas all animals in the control group had detectable viremia for at least 3 days after challenge, all of the vaccinated animals were negative on all days after challenge. Thus, the WN-80E vaccine was 100% efficacious in protecting monkeys against infection with WNV.																					WOS:000269580200011	19641099

Reemerging Rabies and Lack of Systemic Surveillance in People's Republic of China								EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES				15	8			1159	1164		10.3201/eid1508.081426				AUG 2009	2009	Rabies is a reemerging disease in China. The high incidence of rabies leads to numerous concerns: a potential carrier-dog phenomenon, undocumented transmission of rabies virus from wildlife to dogs, counterfeit vaccines, vaccine mismatching, and seroconversion testing in patients after their completion of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). These concerns are all scientifically arguable given a modern understanding of rabies. Rabies reemerges periodically in China because of high dog population density and low vaccination coverage in dogs. Mass vaccination campaigns rather than depopulation of dogs should be a long-term goal for rabies control. Seroconversion testing after vaccination is not necessary in either humans or animals. Human PEP should be initiated on the basis of diagnosis of biting animals. Reliable national systemic surveillance of rabies-related human deaths and of animal rabies prevalence is urgently needed. A laboratory diagnosis-based epidemiologic surveillance system can provide substantial information about disease transmission and effective prevention strategies.

We have recently demonstrated that microglia and astrocytes constitutively express nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-2 (NOD2), a member of the novel nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat region containing a family of proteins (NLR) that functions as an intracellular receptor for a minimal motif present in all bacterial peptidoglycans. In this study, we have confirmed the functional nature of NOD2 expression in astrocytes and microglia and begun to determine the relative contribution that this NLR makes in inflammatory CNS responses to clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. We demonstrate the increased association of NOD2 with its downstream effector molecule, Rip2 kinase, in primary cultures of murine microglia and astrocytes following exposure to bacterial antigens. We show that this cytosolic receptor underlies the ability of muramyl dipeptide to augment the production of inflammatory cytokines by glia following exposure to specific ligands for disparate Toll-like receptor homologues. In addition, we demonstrate that NOD2 is an important component in the in vitro inflammatory responses of resident glia to N. meningitidis and B. burgdorferi antigens. Finally, we have established that NOD2 is required, at least in part, for the astrogliosis, demyelination, behavioral changes, and elevated inflammatory cytokine levels observed following in vivo infection with these pathogens. As such, we have identified NOD2 as an important component in the generation of damaging CNS inflammation following bacterial infection. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Recent introductions of influenza A viruses from avian sources into the human population have raised concerns that these viruses may be a source of a future pandemic strain. Therefore, there is a need to better understand the pathogenicity of avian influenza viruses for mammalian species so that we may be better able to predict the pandemic potential of such viruses and develop improved methods for their prevention and control. In this review, we describe the virulence of H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses in the mouse and ferret models. The use of these models is providing exciting new insights into the contribution of virus and host responses toward avian influenza viruses, virus tropism, and virus transmissibility. Identifying the role of individual viral gene products and mapping the molecular determinants that influence the severity of disease observed following avian influenza virus infection is dependent on the use of reliable animal models. As avian influenza viruses continue to cause human disease and death, animal pathogenesis studies identify avenues of investigation for novel preventative and therapeutic agents that could be effective in the event of a future pandemic.

BDV is a neurotropic virus that causes changes in mood, behaviour and cognition. Patients with psychiatric disorders have a higher incidence of BDV positivity than healthy individuals.METHODS: We examined the seropositivity of BDV circulating immunocomplexes (CIC) in psychiatric patients and healthy individuals (blood donors). We examined 39 psychiatric inpatients for the presence of BDV CIC in the serum by ELISA on day 0, 28 and 56. During the same period psychopathology was measured using psychiatric scales (CGI, CGI-I, MADRS, SDS, PANSS). This is the first such study performed in the Czech Republic.RESULTS: BDV CIC positivity was detected in 66.7% of psychiatric patients (26/39) on day 0, in 53.9% (14/26) on day 28 and in 52.9% on day 56 (9/17). The control group was 22.2% (28/126) positive. The incidence of BDV CIC was significantly higher in psychiatric patients than in healthy individuals (p=0.001). The significantly higher level of BDV CIC was associated with the higher severity of psychopathology in comparison with patients with mild or moderate psychopathology (p=0.03). We did not find any association between BDV CIC positivity and other characteristics (age, diagnosis, family, personal history, the history of infectious diseases, contact with animals).CONCLUSION: In our study psychiatric patients had significantly higher levels of BDV CIC than the control group. The highest levels of BDV CIC were detected in patients with more severe psychopathology.																					WOS:000272199300022	19855370

It has also been shown that the influenza A virus can be transmitted to mammalian species such as tigers and domestic cats and dogs through ingestion of infected birds. Another group of animals that should also be considered as potential hosts for the influenza A virus are the crocodilians. Many crocodilian species share aquatic environments with wild birds that are known to harbor influenza viruses. In addition, many large crocodilians utilize birds as a significant food source. Given these factors in addition to the close taxonomic proximity of aves to the crocodilians, it is feasible to ask whether crocodilian species may also harbor the influenza A virus. Here we analyzed 37 captive crocodilians from two locations in Florida (plus 5 wild bird fecal-samples from their habitat) to detect the presence of influenza A virus. Several sample types were examined. Real-time RT-PCR tests targeting the influenza A matrix gene were positive for four individual crocodilians-Alligator sinensis, Paleosuchus trigonatus, Caiman latirostris and Crocodylus niloticits. Of the seven serum samples tested with the avian influenza virus agar gel immunodiffusion assay, three showed a nonspecific reaction to the avian influenza virus antigen-A. sinensis, P. trigonatus and C. niloticus (C. latirostris was not tested). Viable virus could not be recovered from RT-PCR-positive samples, although this is consistent with previous attempts at viral isolation in embryonated chicken eggs with crocodilian viruses. J. Exp.

Increased Avian Diversity Is Associated with Lower Incidence of Human West Nile Infection: Observation of the Dilution Effect								PLOS ONE				3	6					e2488	10.1371/journal.pone.0002488				JUN 25 2008	2008	Recent infectious disease models illustrate a suite of mechanisms that can result in lower incidence of disease in areas of higher disease host diversity-the 'dilution effect'. These models are particularly applicable to human zoonoses, which are infectious diseases of wildlife that spill over into human populations. As many recent emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses, the mechanisms that underlie the 'dilution effect' are potentially widely applicable and could contribute greatly to our understanding of a suite of diseases. The dilution effect has largely been observed in the context of Lyme disease and the predictions of the underlying models have rarely been examined for other infectious diseases on a broad geographic scale. Here, we explored whether the dilution effect can be observed in the relationship between the incidence of human West Nile virus (WNV) infection and bird (host) diversity in the eastern US. We constructed a novel geospatial contrasts analysis that compares the small differences in avian diversity of neighboring US counties (where one county reported human cases of WNV and the other reported no cases) with associated between-county differences in human disease. We also controlled for confounding factors of climate, regional variation in mosquito vector type, urbanization, and human socioeconomic factors that are all likely to affect human disease incidence. We found there is lower incidence of human WNV in eastern US counties that have greater avian (viral host) diversity. This pattern exists when examining diversity-disease relationships both before WNV reached the US (in 1998) and once the epidemic was underway ( in 2002). The robust disease-diversity relationships confirm that the dilution effect can be observed in another emerging infectious disease and illustrate an important ecosystem service provided by biodiversity, further supporting the growing view that protecting biodiversity should be considered in public health and safety plans.

J	Pollock, Christal G.								West Nile virus in the Americas								JOURNAL OF AVIAN MEDICINE AND SURGERY				22	2			151	157		10.1647/2007-029R.1				JUN 2008	2008	West Nile virus causes sporadic disease in the Eastern hemisphere that is often asymptomatic or mild, whereas in the Western hemisphere, West Nile virus has been associated with illness and profound mortality in many avian species. West Nile virus might have been transported to North America by an infected mosquito or the virus could have entered within a vertebrate host like a bird. Although the most important method of West Nile virus transmission is by Culex species mosquitoes, additional modes of transmission have been identified. West Nile virus has been isolated from almost 300 species of Western birds. The long-term effects on common species such as corvids, sparrows, grackles, finches, hawks, and robins are still being debated. However the potential effect of West Nile virus on small populations or species with limited geographic distribution, Such Lis Hawaiian avifauna, could be much more catastrophic.

J	Vahlenkamp, Thomas								Influenza virus infections in small animals								KLEINTIERPRAXIS				53	6			376	382						JUN 2008	2008	In the past few years in Europe, an increased incidence of infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has occurred in poultry. A direct transmission of avian influenza viruses to mammals has only been described for a few species, e.g. pig, mink, ferret and seal. With respect to the transmission of these viruses to man, it has been assumed that the pig plays a special role as this species can be infected by both avian and human influenza viruses, In the meantime, the infection has occurred in Asia, Europe and Africa and for the first time, lethal infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N1 have been observed in cats and one dog. In addition, infections in humans have been repeatedly seen, a fact which indicates the special biological characteristics of this virus. In the present paper, the basic characteristics of influenza viruses are explained and an overview of influenza virus infections in dogs and cats is given, Our investigations revealed that the clinical signs seen in cats infected with H5N1 are dependent on the infective dose. In addition, cats which have been immunised with an inactivated H5 antigen exhibit a significantly reduced virus excretion rate and were protected against clinical symptoms. Dogs appear to be less susceptible to H5N1 in contrast to other influenza virus subtypes, which have been associated with severe clinical symptoms in this species. Our contact studies showed also that the H5N1 infection is not transmitted from infected cats to uninfected dogs. Finally, the present paper summarises the criteria which can be used to justify the suspicion of an H5N1 influenza virus infection in cats and which samples in such cases should be investigated.

J	Das, Amaresh; Spackman, Erica; Thomas, Colleen; Swayne, David E.; Suarez, David L.								Detection of H5N1 High-Pathogenicity Avian Influenza Virus in Meat and Tracheal Samples from Experimentally Infected Chickens								AVIAN DISEASES				52	1			40	48		10.1637/8093-082107-Reg				MAR 2008	2008	The Asian H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza ( HPAI) virus causes a systemic disease with high mortality of poultry and is potentially zoonotic. In both chickens and ducks, the virus has been demonstrated to replicate in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Experimentally, H5N1 HPAI virus has been transmitted to chickens through the consumption of raw infected meat. In this study, we investigated virus replication in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in the trachea of chickens after experimental intranasal inoculation with the H5N1 HPAI virus. The virus was detected in tissues by real-time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( RRT-PCR) and virus isolation, and in the trachea by RRT-PCR and a commercial avian influenza ( AI) viral antigen detection test. A modified RNA extraction protocol was developed for rapid detection of the virus in tissues by RRT-PCR. The H5N1 HPAI virus was sporadically detected in meat and the tracheas of infected birds without any clinical sign of disease as early as 6 hr postinfection ( PI), and was detected in all samples tested at 24 hr PI and later. No differences in sensitivity were seen between virus isolation and RRT-PCR in meat samples. The AI viral antigen detection test on tracheal swabs was a useful method for identifying infected chickens when they were sick or dead, but was less sensitive in detecting infected birds when they were preclinical. This study provides data indicating that preslaughter tracheal swab testing can identify birds infected with HPAI among the daily mortality and prevent infected flocks from being sent to processing plants. In addition, the modified RNA extraction and RRT-PCR test on meat samples provide a rapid and sensitive method of identifying HPAI virus in illegal contraband or domestic meat samples.

Borna disease virus (BDV) in rats causes cortical and subcortical infection with extrapyramidal motor symptoms, and hippocampal infection suppresses neurogenesis. Given the known effects of cannabinoids in promoting neural progenitor cell survival, the authors examined in vivo effects of chronic BDV infection in rats on BrdU-positive progenitor cells in striatum, together with neuroprotective actions of cannabinoids. Birth and survival of BrdU-positive progenitor cells in striatum of BDV-infected rats treated with a general cannabinoid agonist (WIN 55,212 1 mg/kg i.p. b.i.d. x 7 days) were examined, as well as anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and nutritional effects of cannabinoids. Cannabinoid treatment protected BrdU-positive progenitor cells in striatum that were susceptible to virus-induced injury (p <.01) through suppression of microglia activation (p <.001). As a consequence of their anti-inflammatory actions and support of neural progenitor cell survival, cannabinoids may be adjunctive treatment for encephalitides with microglial inflammation and neurodegeneration.

Because of its significant zoonotic potential this virus is also able to infect humans after direct, close contact with infected birds. The detection of HPAIV H5N1 in wild bird populations as well as in several poultry holdings in Germany in 2006 and 2007 highlighted the problems and dangers of such outbreaks. In this paper, a summary is presented on HPAIV H5N1 infections during 2006-2007 with special emphasis on the situation in Germany.																					WOS:000257363700001

Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara-based vaccine induces protective immunity in mice against infection with influenza virus H5N1								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				195	11			1598	1606		10.1086/517614				JUN 1 2007	2007	Since 2003, the number of human cases of infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype is still increasing, and, therefore, the development of safe and effective vaccines is considered a priority. However, the global production capacity of conventional vaccines is limited and insufficient for a worldwide vaccination campaign. In the present study, an alternative H5N1 vaccine candidate based on the replication-deficient modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was evaluated. C57BL/6J mice were immunized twice with MVA expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from influenza virus A/Hongkong/156/97 (MVAHAHK/ 97) or A/Vietnam/ 1194/04 (MVA-HA-VN/ 04). Subsequently, recombinant MVA-induced protective immunity was assessed after challenge infection with 3 antigenically distinct strains of H5N1 influenza viruses: A/Hongkong/156/97, A/Vietnam/1194/04, and A/Indonesia/5/05. Our data suggest that recombinant MVA expressing the HA of influenza virus A/Vietnam/1194/04 is a promising alternative vaccine candidate that could be used for the induction of protective immunity against various H5N1 influenza strains.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 virus in cats and other carnivores								VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY				122	1-2			25	31		10.1016/j.vetmic.2006.12.021				MAY 16 2007	2007	The Asian lineage highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus is a known pathogen of birds. Only recently, the virus has been reported to cause sporadic fatal disease in carnivores, and its zoonotic potential has been dominating the popular media. Attention to felids was drawn by two outbreaks with high mortality in tigers, leopards and other exotic felids in Thailand. Subsequently, domestic cats were found naturally infected and experimentally susceptible to H5N1 virus. A high susceptibility of the dog to H3N8 equine influenza A virus had been reported earlier, and recently also HPAI H5N1 virus has been identified as a canine pathogen. The ferret, hamster and mouse are suitable as experimental animals; importantly, these species are also kept as pets. Experimental intratracheal and oral infection of cats with an HPAI H5N1 virus isolate from a human case resulted in lethal disease; furthermore, cats have been infected by the feeding of infected chickens. Spread of the infection from experimentally infected to in-contact cats has been reported. The epidemiological role of the cat and other pet animal species in transmitting HPAI H5N1 virus to humans needs continuous consideration and attention. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Distribution of lesions and antigen of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A/Swan/Germany/R65/06 (H5N1) in domestic cats after presumptive infection by wild birds								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				44	3			261	268		10.1354/vp.44-3-261				MAY 2007	2007	In early 2006, the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 of the Asian lineage caused the death of wild aquatic birds in Northern Germany. In the mainly affected areas, a trans-species transmission of HPAIV H5N1 to mammals occurred between birds and domestic cats and 1 Stone Marten (Martes foina), respectively. Here, we report lesions and distribution of influenza virus antigen in 3 cats infected naturally with HPAIV H5N1 A/swan/Germany/R65/06. The hemagglutinin partial nucleotide sequences of the viruses were genetically closely related to a H5N1 HPAIV obtained from a dead Whooper Swan (Cygnus cygnus) of the same area. At necropsy, within the patchy dark-red and consolidated lungs, there was granulomatous pneumonia caused by Aelurostrongylus sp. Histologically, the main findings associated with influenza in all cats were bronchointerstitial pneumonia and marked random hepatic necrosis. In addition, all animals displayed lymphoid necrosis in the spleen and Peyer's patches and necrosis of the adrenal cortex. Immunohistochemically, nucleoprotein of HPAIV was present intralesionally in the lungs, liver, adrenal glands, and lymphoid tissues. Oropharyngeal swabs were shown to be suited to detect HPAIV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in these cats, despite the paucity of influenza virus antigen in the upper respiratory tract by means of immunohistochemistry. The results show that outdoor cats in areas affected by HPAIV in wild birds are at risk for lethal infection. In conclusion, hepatic necrosis was, besides bronchointerstitial pneumonia, the primary lesion, suggesting that in naturally infected cats, damage to the liver plays an important role in the pathogenesis of H5N1 influenza.

Serum samples were collected from seals at Nosappu (231 seals), Akkeshi (16) and Erimo (75), between 1998 and 2005, and were analyzed by ELISA. Antibodies to the influenza A virus were detected only in seals from Nosappu. The incidences were 11% (1/9), 3% (2/66), 12% (7/59) and 6% (5/77) in 1998, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. These suggest sporadic infection. Because anti body-positive seals included juvenile seals in each year, the infections were considered to have been circulated since no later than the late 1990s until recent years. ELISA-positive sera were analyzed by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests to determine the subtypes. Antibodies to the H3 and H6 subtypes were detected in 10 and 2 sera, respectively. Two of the sera that had antibodies to the H6 subtype also had antibodies to the H3 subtype. These two seals were considered to have been infected with both the H3 and H6 subtypes. This is the first investigation to find antibodies to the H6 subtype in seals. Although the H6 subtype had been isolated only from avians, genetic analysis had suggested that the H6 subtype could become a novel mammalian pathogen. For definitive diagnosis, detection of the virus from the tissue or mucus of seals is required.																					WOS:000246330600006	17409641

Virus-specific nucleic acids were detected in pharyngeal swabs from 3 of 40 randomly sampled cats from a group of 194 animals (day 8 after contact with an infected swan). All cats were transferred to a quarantine station and monitored for clinical signs, virus shedding, and antibody production until day 50. Despite unfamiliar handling, social distress, and the presence of other viral and nonviral pathogens that caused illness and poor health and compromised the immune systems, clinical signs of influenza did not develop in any of the cats. There was no evidence of horizontal transmission to other cats because antibodies against H5N1 virus developed in only 2 cats.																					WOS:000244111000008	17479886	
S	Koopmans, Marion; Martina, Byron; Reusken, Chantal; van Maanen, Kees						Takken, W; Knols, BGJ		West Nile virus in Europe: waiting for the start of the epidemic?								EMERGING PESTS AND VECTOR-BORNE DISEASES IN EUROPE		Ecology and Control of Vector-Borne Diseases		1				123	151						2007	2007	The recent changes in West Nile virus (WNV) epidemiology, with incursions into the New World and reporting of increased neuroinvasive disease, have raised concerns that this might happen in Europe as well. Recent studies suggest that a single viral mutation may have resulted in increased virulence specifically for American crows, raising viraemic levels above the critical threshold for mosquitoes present in North America. This illustrates the complexity of predicting by extrapolation what could happen in Europe, a conclusion that has led us to undertake a systematic review of available information from a surveillance perspective. Surveillance studies undertaken since the late 1990s have shown that WNV is present in parts of Europe, particularly but not exclusively in wetland areas. Continued reporting of human or animal cases in subsequent years suggests that in some areas the virus is enzootic, but the picture is far from complete. The fact that additional cases are often found in these areas when active surveillance is done indicates that there is significant underreporting. Whether or not birds, arriving from Central Europe, could establish a sylvatic cycle resulting in an outbreak of WNV in Western Europe will, among other factors, depend on mosquito species present, their activity, and feeding behaviour in late autumn. Consequently, climatic changes that shift the balance of ecological factors towards one favouring the start and maintenance of the transmission cycle may increase the risk of WNV outbreaks in the future, although at present we consider this risk to be low. In addition, several other, largely unknown, factors play a role in the epidemiology of WNV as well. Therefore, monitoring of WNV presence in areas with occasional illness reports should continue but a more coordinated effort is needed to provide a reliable risk map of WNV for Europe that can be used for public health preparedness.

Recently, more and more investigations indicated that BDV infection was close related to human neuropsychic disorders. However, the mechanism underlying the disorders was unclear to date. Some investigators thought neuronal plasticity changes by BDV infection in the central nervous system may be it's cardinal basis. Many researchers have studied the molecular mechanisms, which might lead to disturbances in neuronal plasticity by BDV infection, through infection-based animal modes such as gerbils modes, rats modes, mice modes and transgenic mice modes. The results showed that neuronal plasticity was interfered by BDV infection through interference with trophic support from astrocytes to neurons, interference with amphoterin signaling and interference with neurotrophin signaling. The disturbances in neuronal plasticity would result in cerebral disorders and cause behavior alterations and psychic alterations of host. In the following years, the ability to manipulate the BDV genome may help uncover unrecognized aspects of the basic mechanisms operating in the regulation of neuronal plasticity of interference with neuronal physiology caused by BDV, give academic foundation for clinical prevention and therapy of BD.

The mechanisms whereby such infections disturb brain functions are beginning to emerge. Borna disease virus (BDV), which causes a persistent infection of neurons without direct cytolysis in several mammalian hosts, has recently gained interest as a unique model to study the mechanisms of viral interference with neuronal plasticity. This review will summarize several hypotheses that have been put forward to explain possible levels of BDV interference with brain function. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

BDV preferentially infects the limbic system of the brain of animals as well as humans and, in case of animals, is unequivocally able to cause complex behavioral disorders. Regarding human infections the chapter provides correlative evidence for the concept that BDV contributes to periodicity and symptom spectrum at least of mood disorders. This concept integrates virus and host factors as close interdependent players which finally lead to overt clinical symptoms. Virus factors are the ability to transiently interfere with or to modulate neurotransmitter network functioning, most probably by virus proteins (major antigens). Likely host factors are acute and chronic stress causing altered neuro-endocrine and immune system functioning, thereby facilitating activation of persistent BDV infection. The chapter describes, how virus activation indicated by immune complexes and viral proteins can meanwhile be monitored in the blood through easy-to-use assays, and argues in favor of implementing the respective triple-EIA (enzyme immune assay) as a "gold standard" for infection diagnosis. Furthermore, the apparently beneficial option of an antiviral treatment of depression by the low-risk drug amantadine is considered referring to first clinical trials, as are in vitro studies demonstrating the compound's effectiveness to inhibit virus replication. Finally, experimental animal models are critically reviewed due to their limited if not misleading results for the understanding of natural infections. The chapter does not miss to address the fact that human BDV research has been and still is controversial since the first antibody findings in psychiatric patients. However, this is regarded as expected process in the course of establishing a novel field of research. In summary, the chapter aims to encouraging and guide psychiatrists and medical professionals to pay attention to new concepts by considering aspects that can not be disproved, and to support unusual and/or unconventional approaches in favor of their patients.

These aspects of the disease were investigated during an outbreak in Peru in early 1990.Between Jan 1 and April 30, 1990, 29 (5%) of 636 residents of the two rural communities in the Amazon Jungle in Peru acquired an illness characterised by hydrophobia, fever, and headache and died shortly thereafter. A census in one of the two towns revealed that the proportion affected was significantly higher for 5-14 year olds (17%) than for other age-groups (p < 10(-5)). Interviews conducted with 23 of the patients or their families revealed that 22 (96%) had a history of bat bite, compared with 66 (22%) of 301 community members who remained healthy (p < 10(-6)). A rabies virus strain identical to those isolated from vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) was isolated from the brain of the only person on whom necropsy could be done.Because of the extreme isolation of this and other communities affected by bat-transmitted rabies, preventive measures should be directed at decreasing the risk of nocturnal exposure to bats by bat proofing dwellings or use of mosquito nets and at prompt wound care. Rabies pre-exposure or postexposure vaccination is clearly indicated, but may not be feasible in these isolated populations.																					WOS:A1992HD65900013	1346669
