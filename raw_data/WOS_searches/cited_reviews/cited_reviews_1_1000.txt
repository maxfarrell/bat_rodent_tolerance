In addition, how age modulates SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infections remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated age-associated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune responses, and the occurrence of re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infection utilizing a wild-type C57BL/6N mouse model. We demonstrated that interferon and adaptive antibody response upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge are significantly impaired in aged mice compared to young mice, which results in more effective virus replications and severe disease manifestations in the respiratory tract. Aged mice also showed increased susceptibility to re-infection due to insufficient immune protection acquired during the primary infection. Importantly, two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination conferred limited adaptive immune response among the aged mice, making them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings call for tailored and optimized treatments and prevention strategies against SARS-CoV-2 among older individuals.																					WOS:000746696900001	34989330

It is transmitted by percutaneous injuries (PIs), contaminated blood and/or blood products, sexual contact, and vertical mother-to-child transmission. It is widely prevalent in general population, especially in high-risk groups. HPgV-1 viremia is typically cleared within the first 1-2 years of infection in most healthy individuals, but may persist for longer periods of time in immunocompromised individuals and/or those co-infected by other viruses. A large body of evidences indicate that HPgV-1 persistent infection has a beneficial clinical effect on many infectious diseases, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis C. The beneficial effects seem to be related to a significant reduction of immune activation, and/or the inhabitation of co-infected viruses (e.g. HIV-1). HPgV-1 has a broad cellular tropism for lymphoid and myeloid cells, and preferentially replicates in bone marrow and spleen without cytopathic effect, implying a therapeutic potential. The paper aims to summarize the natural history, prevalence and distribution characteristics, and pathogenesis of HPgV-1, and discuss its association with other human viral diseases, and potential use in therapy as a biovaccine or viral vector.

Although humans are the main susceptible host, experimental studies and reported cases of natural infection have evidenced scenarios of SARS-CoV-2 reverse zoonosis in animals.Objective: To evaluate the natural infection of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and dogs of owners diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Aburra Valley, Antioquia, Colombia.Materials and methods: The circulation of SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated by RT-qPCR and RT-PCR in samples of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal smears from cats and dogs whose owners had latency due to COVID-19 infection. The positive cases were verified by amplifying fragments of the RdRp, N and E genes; and the RdRp amplicon was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed.Results: Six cats and three dogs were confirmed cases of natural infection for SARS-CoV-2 from 80 tested animals. The animals did not show clinical signs; and their owners, who suffered from the infection, reported only mild signs of the disease without clinical complications. In the analysis of one of the sequences, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was found with a change in position 647 substituting the amino acid serine (S) for an isoleucine (I). The cases occurred in the municipalities of Caldas, Medellin and Envigado.Conclusions: It is inferred that natural infection in cats and dogs is associated with direct contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Several existing antiviral drugs has been worked on, without proper results and meanwhile the virus is mutating rapidly to create more infectious variant. In order to find some alternatives, phytocompounds can be opted as good one. In this study, three hundred phytocompounds were screened virtually against two viral proteins namely main protease and spike protein. Molecular docking and dynamic simulation study was used to find binding affinity, structural stability and flexibility of the complex. Pharmacokinetic properties were studied through ADMET analysis. To understand energy variation of the complex structure free energy landscape analysis was performed. Among three hundred phytocompounds virtual screening, three phytocompounds were selected for detailed molecular interaction analysis. Oleanderolide, Proceragenin A and Balsaminone A, showed strong binding af-finity against both the target proteins and reflected conformational stability throughout the MD run. Ole-anderolide, proceragenin A and balsaminone A has docking score-9.4 kcal/mol,-8.6 kcal/mol, and-8.1 kcal/ mol respectively against main protease and same-8.3 kcal/mol docking score against spike protein. These three phytocompounds has high gastrointestinal absorption capacity. They were unexplored till now for their antiviral activity. Their promising in silico results suggests that they can be promoted in the long run for development of new antiviral drugs.																					WOS:000798195400001	35468453

Mutations in spike largely contributed to adaptation. Viral persistence is a prerequisite for intra-host virus evolution, and this likely occurred in immunocompromised patients who allow intra-host long-term viral replication. The underlying mechanism leading to the emergence of variants during viral persistence in the immunocompromised host is still unknown. Here, we show the existence of an ensemble of minor mutants in the early biological samples obtained from an immunocompromised patient and their dynamic interplay with the master mutant during a persistent and productive long-term infection. In particular, after 222 days of active viral replication, the original master mutant, named MB61(0), was replaced by a minor quasispecies (MB61(222)) expressing two critical mutations in spike, namely Q493K and N501T. Isolation of the two viruses allowed us to show that MB61(222) entry into target cells occurred mainly by the fusion at the plasma membrane (PM), whereas endocytosis characterized the entry mechanism used by MB61(0). Interestingly, coinfection of two human cell lines of different origin with the SARS-CoV-2 isolates highlighted the early and dramatic predominance of MB61(222) over MB61(0) replication. This finding may be explained by a faster replicative activity of MB61(222) as compared to MB61(0) as well as by the capability of MB61(222) to induce peculiar viral RNA-sensing mechanisms leading to an increased production of interferons (IFNs) and, in particular, of IFN-induced transmembrane protein 1 (IFITM1) and IFITM2. Indeed, it has been recently shown that IFITM2 is able to restrict SARS-CoV-2 entry occurring by endocytosis. In this regard, MB61(222) may escape the antiviral activity of IFITMs by using the PM fusion pathway for entry into the target cell, whereas MB61(0) cannot escape this host antiviral response during MB61(222) coinfection, since it has endocytosis as the main pathway of entry. Altogether, our data support the evidence of quasispecies fighting for host dominance by taking benefit from the cell machinery to restrict the productive infection of competitors in the viral ensemble. This finding may explain, at least in part, the extraordinary rapid worldwide turnover of VOCs that use the PM fusion pathway to enter into target cells over the original pandemic strain.

Histopathologic and Immunohistochemical Evaluation of Induced Lesions, Tissue Tropism and Host Responses following Experimental Infection of Egyptian Rousette Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) with the Zoonotic Paramyxovirus, Sosuga Virus								VIRUSES-BASEL				14	6					1278	10.3390/v14061278				JUN 2022	2022	Ecological and experimental infection studies have identified Egyptian rousette bats (ERBs; Rousettus aegyptiacus: family Pteropodidae) as a reservoir host for the zoonotic rubula-like paramyxovirus Sosuga virus (SOSV). A serial sacrifice study of colony-bred ERBs inoculated with wild-type, recombinant SOSV identified small intestines and salivary gland as major sites of viral replication. In the current study, archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues from the serial sacrifice study were analyzed in depth-histologically and immunohistochemically, for SOSV, mononuclear phagocytes and T cells. Histopathologic lesion scores increased over time and viral antigen persisted in a subset of tissues, indicating ongoing host responses and underscoring the possibility of chronic infection. Despite the presence of SOSV NP antigen and villus ulcerations in the small intestines, there were only mild increases in mononuclear phagocytes and T cells, a host response aligned with disease tolerance. In contrast, there was a statistically significant, robust and targeted mononuclear phagocyte cell responses in the salivary glands at 21 DPI, where viral antigen was sparse. These findings may have broader implications for chiropteran-paramyxovirus interactions, as bats are hypothesized to be the ancestral hosts of this diverse virus family and for ERB immunology in general, as this species is also the reservoir host for the marburgviruses Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV) (family Filoviridae).

J	Singh, Sameer; Gokhale, Sharad								Effect of COVID-19 epidemic-led lockdowns on aerosol black carbon concentration, sources and its radiation effect in northeast India								JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE				131	2					139	10.1007/s12040-022-01883-4				JUN 2022	2022	The COVID-19 epidemic-led lockdown (LD) from March 25 to May 31, 2020, had a different level of impact on air quality in the ecologically sensitive region of northeast India, even though the restriction on main anthropogenic activities was expected to reduce particulate matter concentration. The daily average black carbon concentration measured at 880 nm (BC880) was 1.5-15.6 mu g m(-3) (mean: 5.75 +/- 4.24 mu g m(-3)) during the measurement period. It was 9.29 +/- 4.11 mu g m(-3) during pre-LD (February 12-March 21), 4.70 +/- 0.95 mu g m(-3) during LD1 (March 25-April 14), 3.41 +/- 0.56 mu g m(-3) during LD2 (April 15-May 3), 3.69 +/- 1.50 mu g m(-3) during LD3 (May 4-17), 2.94 +/- 0.93 mu g m(-3) during LD4 (May 18-31), and 6.56 +/- 5.35 mu g m(-3) during the Post-LD (June 6-July 3) of 2020. It decreased up to 68% during the lockdowns. The source apportionment based on an improved method showed a significant improvement in the contribution of BC880 sources. The radiation effect determined by Angstrom Absorption Exponent showed that brown carbon accounted for 25% of the aerosol light absorption at 370 nm during the lockdown period. Relative humidity correlates substantially with BC880, while rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation were negatively correlated. The bivariate analysis showed the dominance of local emissions in the BC880 concentrations.																					WOS:000805940700003		
J	Stapleton, Jack T.								Human Pegivirus Type 1: A Common Human Virus That Is Beneficial in Immune-Mediated Disease?								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				13						887760	10.3389/fimmu.2022.887760				MAY 30 2022	2022	Two groups identified a novel human flavivirus in the mid-1990s. One group named the virus hepatitis G virus (HGV) and the other named it GB Virus type C (GBV-C). Sequence analyses found these two isolates to be the same virus, and subsequent studies found that the virus does not cause hepatitis despite sharing genome organization with hepatitis C virus. Although HGV/GBV-C infection is common and may cause persistent infection in humans, the virus does not appear to directly cause any other known disease state. Thus, the virus was renamed "human pegivirus 1" (HPgV-1) for "persistent G" virus. HPgV-1 is found primarily in lymphocytes and not hepatocytes, and several studies found HPgV-1 infection associated with prolonged survival in people living with HIV. Co-infection of human lymphocytes with HPgV-1 and HIV inhibits HIV replication. Although three viral proteins directly inhibit HIV replication in vitro, the major effects of HPgV-1 leading to reduced HIV-related mortality appear to result from a global reduction in immune activation. HPgV-1 specifically interferes with T cell receptor signaling (TCR) by reducing proximal activation of the lymphocyte specific Src kinase LCK. Although TCR signaling is reduced, T cell activation is not abolished and with sufficient stimulus, T cell functions are enabled. Consequently, HPgV-1 is not associated with immune suppression. The HPgV-1 immunomodulatory effects are associated with beneficial outcomes in other diseases including Ebola virus infection and possibly graft-versus-host-disease following stem cell transplantation. Better understanding of HPgV-1 immune escape and mechanisms of inflammation may identify novel therapies for immune-based diseases.																					WOS:000810180700001	35707535

Since its spread in humans, secondary host jumps of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to multiple domestic and wild populations of mammals have been documented. Understanding the extent of adaptation to these animal hosts is critical for assessing the threat that the spillback of animal-adapted SARS-CoV-2 into humans poses. We compare the genomic landscapes of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animal species to that in humans, profiling the mutational biases indicative of potentially different selective pressures in animals. We focus on viral genomes isolated from mink (Neovison vison) and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) for which multiple independent outbreaks driven by onward animal-to-animal transmission have been reported. We identify five candidate mutations for animal-specific adaptation in mink (NSP9_G37E, Spike_F486L, Spike_N501T, Spike_Y453F, ORF3a_L219V), and one in deer (NSP3a_L1035F), though they appear to confer a minimal advantage for human-to-human transmission. No considerable changes to the mutation rate or evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted from circulation in mink and deer thus far. Our findings suggest that minimal adaptation was required for onward transmission in mink and deer following human-to-animal spillover, highlighting the 'generalist' nature of SARS-CoV-2 as a mammalian pathogen.Here, Tan et al. find that the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in mink and deer required minimal adaptation, has only caused moderate changes to the evolutionary trajectory of the virus, and has not led to viral mutations that greatly improve human transmission thus far.

J	Gong, Wenping; Parkkila, Seppo; Wu, Xueqiong; Aspatwar, Ashok								SARS-CoV-2 variants and COVID-19 vaccines: Current challenges and future strategies								INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS OF IMMUNOLOGY											10.1080/08830185.2022.2079642		MAY 2022			2022	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global threat. Despite strict control measures implemented worldwide and immunization using novel vaccines, the pandemic continues to rage due to emergence of several variants of SARS-CoV-2 with increased transmission and immune escape. The rapid spread of variants of concern (VOC) in the recent past has created a massive challenge for the control of COVID-19 pandemic via the currently used vaccines. Vaccines that are safe and effective against the current and future variants of SARS-CoV-2 are essential in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Rapid production and massive rollout of next-generation vaccines against the variants are key steps to control the COVID-19 pandemic and to help us return to normality. Coordinated surveillance of SARS-CoV-2, rapid redesign of new vaccines and extensive vaccination are needed to counter the current SARS-CoV-2 variants and prevent the emergence of new variants. In this article, we review the latest information on the VOCs and variants of interest (VOIs) and present the information on the clinical trials that are underway on evaluating the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines on VOCs. We also discuss the current challenges posed by the VOCs in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and future strategies to overcome the threat posed by the highly virulent and rapidly transmissible variants of SARS-CoV2.Plain Language Summary The COVID-19 is a contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in 2019. The COVID-19 has now spread to all part of the world and has become a global threat. Even after the strict control measures and immunization programs to prevent the disease, COVID-19 is still causing destruction due to appearance of new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that transmit faster and capable of escaping the immunity. The faster spread of the new strains of viruses that cause more severe disease is the biggest challenge to control the COVID-19 pandemic by using the presently available vaccines. To control the COVID-19 pandemic we urgently need safe and effective vaccines against the corona viral variants. This can be achieved by tracking the appearance of new viral types, design and rapid production and supply of new vaccines against the virus. This article presents the latest information on the new types of SARS-CoV-2, and on the status of vaccine trials and their effectiveness against these viruses. Similarly, the information on the challenges posed by the new viral strains in controlling the COVID-19 and future strategies to overcome the threat posed by corona viruses is also provided.

The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted our efforts to identify, develop, and evaluate several antiviral agents.Effective broad-spectrum antivirals are critical to prevent and control emerging human coronavirus (hCoV) infections. Despite considerable progress made toward identifying and evaluating several synthetic broad-spectrum antivirals against hCoV infections, a narrow therapeutic window has limited their success. Enhancing the endogenous interferon (IFN) and IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) response is another antiviral strategy that has been known for decades. However, the side effects of pegylated type-I IFNs (IFN-Is) and the proinflammatory response detected after delayed IFN-I therapy have discouraged their clinical use. In contrast to IFN-Is, IFN-lambda, a dominant IFN at the epithelial surface, has been shown to be less proinflammatory. Consequently, we evaluated the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of IFN-lambda in hCoV-infected airway epithelial cells and mice. Human primary airway epithelial cells treated with a single dose of IFN-I (IFN-alpha) and IFN-lambda showed similar ISG expression, whereas cells treated with two doses of IFN-lambda expressed elevated levels of ISG compared to that of IFN-alpha-treated cells. Similarly, mice treated with two doses of IFN-lambda were better protected than mice that received a single dose, and a combination of prophylactic and delayed therapeutic regimens completely protected mice from a lethal Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) infection. A two-dose IFN-lambda regimen significantly reduced lung viral titers and inflammatory cytokine levels with marked improvement in lung inflammation. Collectively, we identified an effective regimen for IFN-lambda use and demonstrated the protective efficacy of IFN-lambda in MERS-CoV-infected mice. IMPORTANCE Effective antiviral agents are urgently required to prevent and treat individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viral infections. The COVID-19 pandemic has catapulted our efforts to identify, develop, and evaluate several antiviral agents. However, a narrow therapeutic window has limited the protective efficacy of several broad-spectrum and CoV-specific antivirals. IFN-lambda is an antiviral agent of interest due to its ability to induce a robust endogenous antiviral state and low levels of inflammation. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy and effective treatment regimen of IFN-lambda in mice infected with a lethal dose of MERS-CoV. We show that while prophylactic and early therapeutic IFN-lambda administration is protective, delayed treatment is detrimental. Notably, a combination of prophylactic and delayed therapeutic administration of IFN-lambda protected mice from severe MERS. Our results highlight the prophylactic and therapeutic use of IFN-lambda against lethal hCoV and likely other viral lung infections.																					WOS:000799889800001	35588276

Despite its importance and large number of studies worldwide, less attention has been paid in South America. We summarized some general concepts and methodological issues related to the study of mosquito blood feeding habits, and compiled and analyzed all published information regarding the subject in the continent until 2020. Available literature comprised 152 scientific studies, that pursued different approaches: human landing catches (102 studies), baited trap (19), and blood meal analyses of collected specimens (38). Among the latter, 23 used serological and 15 molecular techniques. Species most frequently studied were those incriminated in malaria transmission, whereas relevant vectors such as Aedes aegypti, Ae. albopictus, and Haemagogus janthinomys were surprisingly neglected. Brazil was the leading country both in number of works and species studied. For over 70% of the species and three out of 13 South American countries there is no single information on mosquito blood feeding habits. Data from baited traps included 143 mosquito species, 83.9% of which were attracted to humans, either exclusively (10.5%) or in combination with other vertebrates (73.4%). Host blood identification of field collected specimens provided data on 102 mosquito species, and 60.8% of these fed on humans (55.9% combined with other vertebrates). Only 17 of the 73 species assessed by both methods yielded similar feeding patterns. Finally, supplementary tables are provided in a comprehensive summary of all information available and information gaps are highlighted for future research in the continent.

Potent neutralization by monoclonal human IgM against SARS-CoV-2 is impaired by class switch								EMBO REPORTS										e53956	10.15252/embr.202153956		MAY 2022			2022	To investigate the class-dependent properties of anti-viral IgM antibodies, we use membrane antigen capture activated cell sorting to isolate spike-protein-specific B cells from donors recently infected with SARS-CoV-2, allowing production of recombinant antibodies. We isolate 20, spike-protein-specific antibodies of classes IgM, IgG, and IgA, none of which shows any antigen-independent binding to human cells. Two antibodies of class IgM mediate virus neutralization at picomolar concentrations, but this potency is lost following artificial switch to IgG. Although, as expected, the IgG versions of the antibodies appear to have lower avidity than their IgM parents, this is not sufficient to explain the loss of potency.

J	Khan, Shahneaz Ali; Imtiaz, Mohammed Ashif; Islam, Md Mazharul; Tanzin, Abu Zubayer; Islam, Ariful; Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul								Major bat-borne zoonotic viral epidemics in Asia and Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis								VETERINARY MEDICINE AND SCIENCE											10.1002/vms3.835		MAY 2022			2022	Bats are the natural reservoir host for many pathogenic and non-pathogenic viruses, potentially spilling over to humans and domestic animals directly or via an intermediate host. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the continuation of virus spillover events that have taken place over the last few decades, particularly in Asia and Africa. Therefore, these bat-associated epidemics provide a significant number of hints, including respiratory cellular tropism, more intense susceptibility to these cell types, and overall likely to become a pandemic for the next spillover. In this systematic review, we analysed data to insight, through bat-originated spillover in Asia and Africa. We used STATA/IC-13 software for descriptive statistics and meta-analysis. The random effect of meta-analysis showed that the pooled estimates of case fatality rates of bat-originated viral zoonotic diseases were higher in Africa (61.06%, 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, I-2% = 97.3, p < 0.001). Moreover, estimates of case fatality rates were higher in Ebola (61.06%; 95%CI: 50.26 to 71.85, I-2% = 97.3, p < 0.001) followed by Nipah (55.19%; 95%CI: 39.29 to 71.09, I-2% = 94.2, p < 0.001), MERS (18.49%; 95%CI: 8.19 to 28.76, I-2% = 95.4, p <0.001) and SARS (10.86%; 95%CI: 6.02 to 15.71, I-2%= 85.7, p < 0.001) with the overall case fatality rates of 29.86 (95%CI: 29.97 to 48.58, I-2%= 99.0, p <0.001). Bat-originated viruses have caused several outbreaks of deadly diseases, including Nipah, Ebola, SARS and MERS in Asia and Africa in a sequential fashion. Nipah virus emerged first in Malaysia, but later, periodic outbreaks were noticed in Bangladesh and India. Similarly, the Ebola virus was detected in the African continent with neurological disorders in humans, like Nipah, seen in the Asian region. Two important coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, were introduced, both with the potential to infect respiratory passages. This paper explores the dimension of spillover events within and/or between bat-human and the epidemiological risk factors, which may lead to another pandemic occurring. Further, these processes enhance the bat-originated virus, which utilises an intermediate host to jump into human species.																					WOS:000792849000001	35537080

Recently, the antiviral immune response is enhanced by the regulation of ubiquitination. Intriguingly, Flaviviridae viruses can ingeniously hijack the ubiquitination system to help them survive, which has become a hot topic among worldwide researchers. The Flaviviridae family members, such as HCV and CSFV, can cause serious diseases of humans and animals around the world. The multiple roles of ubiquitination involved in the life cycle of Flaviviridae family would open new sight for future development of antiviral tactic. Here, we discuss recent advances with regard to functional roles of ubiquitination and some ubiquitin-like modifications in the life cycle of Flaviviridae infection, shedding new light on the antiviral mechanism research and therapeutic drug development.

J	Zhang, Qian; Bastard, Paul; Cobat, Aurelie; Casanova, Jean-Laurent		COVID Human Genetic Effort						Human genetic and immunological determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia								NATURE				603	7902			587	598		10.1038/s41586-022-04447-0		JAN 2022		MAR 24 2022	2022	SARS-CoV-2 infection is benign in most individuals but, in around 10% of cases, it triggers hypoxaemic COVID-19 pneumonia, which leads to critical illness in around 3% of cases. The ensuing risk of death (approximately 1% across age and gender) doubles every five years from childhood onwards and is around 1.5 times greater in men than in women. Here we review the molecular and cellular determinants of critical COVID-19 pneumonia. Inborn errors of type I interferons (IFNs), including autosomal TLR3 and X-chromosome-linked TLR7 deficiencies, are found in around 1-5% of patients with critical pneumonia under 60 years old, and a lower proportion in older patients. Pre-existing auto-antibodies neutralizing IFN alpha, IFN beta and/or IFN omega, which are more common in men than in women, are found in approximately 15-20% of patients with critical pneumonia over 70 years old, and a lower proportion in younger patients. Thus, at least 15% of cases of critical COVID-19 pneumonia can be explained. The TLR3- and TLR7-dependent production of type I IFNs by respiratory epithelial cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, respectively, is essential for host defence against SARS-CoV-2. In ways that can depend on age and sex, insufficient type I IFN immunity in the respiratory tract during the first few days of infection may account for the spread of the virus, leading to pulmonary and systemic inflammation.

From bats to pangolins: new insights into species differences in the structure and function of the immune system								INNATE IMMUNITY				28	3-4			107	121	17534259221093120	10.1177/17534259221093120		MAY 2022		APR 2022	2022	Species differences in the structure and function of the immune system of laboratory animals are known to exist and have been reviewed extensively. However, the number and diversity of wild and exotic species, along with their associated viruses, that come into contact with humans has increased worldwide sometimes with lethal consequences. Far less is known about the immunobiology of these exotic and wild species. Data suggest that species differences of the mechanisms of inflammation, innate immunity and adaptive immunity are all involved in the establishment and maintenance of viral infections across reservoir hosts. The current review attempts to collect relevant data concerning the basics of innate and adaptive immune functions of exotic and wild species followed by identification of those differences that may play a role in the maintenance of viral infections in reservoir hosts.

MAY 4 2022	2022	The SARS-CoV-2 virus, the pathogen causing COVID-19, has caused more than 200 million confirmed cases, resulting in more than 4.5 million deaths worldwide by the end of August, 2021. Upon detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), multiple signaling cascades are activated, which ultimately leads to innate immune response such as induction of type I and III interferons, as well as other antiviral genes that together restrict viral spread by suppressing different steps of the viral life cycle. Our understanding of the contribution of the innate immune system in recognizing and subsequently initiating a host response to an invasion of SARS-CoV-2 has been rapidly expanding from 2020. Simultaneously, SARSCoV-2 has evolved multiple immune evasion strategies to escape from host immune surveillance for successful replication. In this review, we will address the current knowledge of innate immunity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlight recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 evades a host's innate defense system.

Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are key orchestrators of host antiviral defense and tissue tolerance during a variety of respiratory infections, and AM dysfunction is associated with severe COVID-19. In this study, using a mouse model of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, we examined the role of AMs in MERS pathogenesis. Our results show that depletion of AMs using clodronate (CL) liposomes significantly increased morbidity and mortality in human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 knock-in (hDPP4-KI) mice. Detailed examination of control and AM-depleted lungs at different days postinfection revealed increased neutrophil activity but a significantly reduced MERS-CoV-specific CD4 T-cell response in AM-deficient lungs during later stages of infection. Furthermore, enhanced MERS severity in AM-depleted mice correlated with lung inflammation and lesions. Collectively, these data demonstrate that AMs are critical for the development of an optimal virus-specific T-cell response and controlling excessive inflammation during MERS-CoV infection.

Therefore, it is important to assess possible therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2 via its most interaction targets. The present study aimed to perform a systematic review on clinical and experimental investigations regarding SARS-COV-2 interaction targets for human cell entry. Methods: A systematic search using relevant MeSH terms and keywords was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science (ISI) databases up to July 2021. Two reviewers independently assessed the eligibility of the studies, extracted the data, and evaluated the methodological quality of the included studies. Additionally, a narrative synthesis was done as a qualitative method for data gathering and synthesis of each outcome measure. Results: A total of 5610 studies were identified, and 128 articles were included in the systematic review. Based on the results, spike antigen was the only interaction protein from SARS-CoV-2. However, the interaction proteins from humans varied including different spike receptors and several cleavage enzymes. The most common interactions of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 for cell entry were ACE2 (entry receptor) and TMPRSS2 (for spike priming). A lot of published studies have mainly focused on the ACE2 receptor followed by the TMPRSS family and furin. Based on the results, ACE2 polymorphisms as well as spike RBD mutations affected the SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity. Conclusion: The included studies shed more light on SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry mechanisms and detailed interactions, which could enhance the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and the development of new and comprehensive therapeutic approaches.

Both are bat-borne viruses and in humans, their mortality rates can reach 60% in the case of HeV and 92% for NiV, thus being two of the deadliest viruses known for humans. Several factors, including a large cellular tropism and a wide zoonotic potential, con-tribute to their high pathogenicity. This review provides an overview of HeV and NiV pathogenicity mechanisms and provides a summary of their interactions with the immune systems of their different host species, including their natural hosts bats, spillover-hosts pigs, horses, and humans, as well as in experimental animal models. A better understanding of the interactions between henipaviruses and their hosts could facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies and vaccine measures against these re-emerging viruses.

RVF affects sheep, goats, cattle and camels, causing a high rate of abortions and death of newborn lambs. Also, humans can be infected, developing a usually self-limiting disease that can turn into a more severe illness in a low percentage of cases. Although different veterinary vaccines are available in endemic areas in Africa, to date no human vaccine has been licensed. In previous works, we described the selection and characterization of a favipiravir-mutagenized RVFV variant, termed 40Fp8, with potential as a RVF vaccine candidate due to the strong attenuation shown in immunocompromised animal models. Compared to the parental South African 56/74 viral strain, 40Fp8 displayed 7 amino acid substitutions in the L-protein, three of them located in the central region corresponding to the catalytic core of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In this work, by means of a reverse genetics system, we have analyzed the effect on virulence of these amino acid changes, alone or combined, both in vitro and in vivo. We found that the simultaneous introduction of two changes (G924S and A1303T) in the heterologous ZH548-RVFV Egyptian strain conferred attenuated phenotypes to the rescued viruses as shown in infected mice without affecting virus immunogenicity. Our results suggest that both changes induce resistance to favipiravir likely associated to some fitness cost that could be the basis for the observed attenuation in vivo. Conversely, the third change, I1050V, appears to be a compensatory mutation increasing viral fitness. Altogether, these results provide relevant information for the safety improvement of novel live attenuated RVFV vaccines.																					WOS:000794335000001	35573791

The Global Virome in One Network (VIRION): an Atlas of Vertebrate-Virus Associations								MBIO				13	2					e02985-21	10.1128/mbio.02985-21				APR 26 2022	2022	Data that catalogue viral diversity on Earth have been fragmented across sources, disciplines, formats, and various degrees of open sharing, posing challenges for research on macroecology, evolution, and public health. Here, we solve this problem by establishing a dynamically maintained database of vertebrate-virus associations, called The Global Virome in One Network (VIRION). The VIRION database has been assembled through both reconciliation of static data sets and integration of dynamically updated databases. These data sources are all harmonized against one taxonomic backbone, including metadata on host and virus taxonomic validity and higher classification; additional metadata on sampling methodology and evidence strength are also available in a harmonized format. In total, the VIRION database is the largest open-source, open-access database of its kind, with roughly half a million unique records that include 9,521 resolved virus "species" (of which 1,661 are ICTV ratified), 3,692 resolved vertebrate host species, and 23,147 unique interactions between taxonomically valid organisms. Together, these data cover roughly a quarter of mammal diversity, a 10th of bird diversity, and similar to 6% of the estimated total diversity of vertebrates, and a much larger proportion of their virome than any previous database. We show how these data can be used to test hypotheses about microbiology, ecology, and evolution and make suggestions for best practices that address the unique mix of evidence that coexists in these data. IMPORTANCE Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling, tangled network of species interactions. Data on the host-virus network are available from several sources, which use different naming conventions and often report metadata in different levels of detail. VIRION is a new database that combines several of these existing data sources, reconciles taxonomy to a single consistent backbone, and reports metadata in a format designed by and for virologists. Researchers can use VIRION to easily answer questions like "Can any fish viruses infect humans?" or "Which bats host coronaviruses?" or to build more advanced predictive models, making it an unprecedented step toward a full inventory of the global virome.Animals and their viruses are connected by a sprawling, tangled network of species interactions.

It was first detected in December 2019 in China's Wuhan City where various patients got admitted to the hospitals with a symptom of pneumonia. As the number of cases increased, scientists isolated the samples from patients. Initially, it was named as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and now renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus spread from Wuhan to other cities of China, and currently it is affecting worldwide. Transmission of this virus occurs from one human to another and spreads through contaminated hands or surfaces. Various researchers are trying to explore the potential role of bioactive compounds from plants and different nanomaterials against this virus. Therefore, in this review, an overview of SARS-CoV-2, preventive measures against this viral infection, potential biocides against this virus, and role of phytochemicals and nanomaterials against this virus have been discussed.

Brazil is a global COVID-19 hot spot and several cases of human-to-cat transmission have been documented. We investigated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by testing 547 domestic cats sampled between July-November 2020 from seven states in southern, southeastern, and northeastern Brazil. Moreover, we investigated whether immune responses elicited by enzootic coronaviruses affect SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats. We found infection with significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers against the Gamma variant of concern, endemic in Brazil during 2020, than against an early SARS-CoV-2 B.1 isolate (p<0.0001), validating the use of Gamma for further testing. The overall SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in Brazilian cats during late 2020 validated by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) was 7.3% (95% CI, 5.3-9.8). There was no significant difference in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in cats between Brazilian states, suggesting homogeneous infection levels ranging from 4.6% (95% CI, 2.2-8.4) to 11.4% (95% CI, 6.7-17.4; p=0.4438). Seroprevalence of the prototypic cat coronavirus Feline coronavirus (FCoV) in a PRNT90 was high at 33.3% (95% CI, 24.9-42.5) and seroprevalence of Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) was low at 1.7% (95% CI, 0.2-5.9) in a PRNT90. Neutralizing antibody titers were significantly lower for FCoV than for SARS-CoV-2 (p=0.0001), consistent with relatively more recent infection of cats with SARS-CoV-2. Neither the magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers (p=0.6390), nor SARS-CoV-2 infection status were affected by FCoV serostatus (p=0.8863). Our data suggest that pre-existing immunity against enzootic coronaviruses neither prevents, nor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infection in cats. High SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence already during the first year of the pandemic substantiates frequent infection of domestic cats and raises concerns on potential SARS-CoV-2 mutations escaping human immunity upon spillback.

Among the numerous affected animals, cats are one of the most susceptible species. However, little is known about viral pathogenicity and transmissibility in the case of variants of concern (VOCs) in animal hosts, such as the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant first detected in India. Here, we have identified the B.1.617.2 (Delta) VOC in a cat living with a COVID-19 positive owner. The animal presented mild symptoms (sneezing) and a high viral load was detected in the oropharyngeal swab, suggesting that an active infection was occurring in the upper respiratory tract of the cat. Transmission from the owner to the cat occurred despite the human being fully vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. This study documents the first detection of B.1.165.2 VOC in a cat in Spain and emphasizes the importance of performing active surveillance and genomic investigation on infected animals.

Methods: We carried out a longitudinal survey from August 2020 to July 2021 at two sites in Zimbabwe with bat-human interactions: Magweto cave and Chirundu farm. A total of 1732 and 1866 individual bat fecal samples were collected, respectively. Coronaviruses and bat species were amplified using PCR systems. Results: Analysis of the coronavirus sequences revealed a high genetic diversity, and we identified different sub-viral groups in the Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus genus. The established sub-viral groups fell within the described Alphacoronavirus sub-genera: Decacovirus, Duvinacovirus, Rhinacovirus, Setracovirus and Minunacovirus and for Betacoronavirus sub-genera: Sarbecoviruses, Merbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Our results showed an overall proportion for CoV positive PCR tests of 23.7% at Chirundu site and 16.5% and 38.9% at Magweto site for insectivorous bats and Macronycteris gigas, respectively. Conclusions: The higher risk of bat coronavirus exposure for humans was found in December to March in relation to higher viral shedding peaks of coronaviruses in the parturition, lactation and weaning months of the bat populations at both sites. We also highlight the need to further document viral infectious risk in human/domestic animal populations surrounding bat habitats in Zimbabwe.																					WOS:000786783200001	35458511

However, the susceptibility of many animal species remains unknown. Furthermore, the expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors, such as the receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as well as transmembrane protease serine subtype 2 (TMPRSS2) and cathepsin L (CTSL), cellular proteases involved in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein activation, are largely unexplored in most species. Here, we generated primary cell cultures from the respiratory tract of domestic and wildlife animals to assess their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, the presence of ACE2, TMPRSS2 and CTSL within respiratory tract compartments was investigated in a range of animals, some with unknown susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Productive viral replication was observed in the nasal mucosa explants and precision-cut lung slices from dogs and hamsters, whereas culture models from ferrets and multiple ungulate species were non-permissive to infection. Overall, whereas TMPRSS2 and CTSL were equally expressed in the respiratory tract, the expression levels of ACE2 were more variable, suggesting that a restricted availability of ACE2 may contribute to reduced susceptibility. Summarized, the experimental infection of primary respiratory tract cell cultures, as well as an analysis of entry-factor distribution, enable screening for SARS-CoV-2 animal reservoirs.

In a viral discovery research program in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) pediatric patients, HPgV-1 was detected in 3 out of 14 patients (21.4%) using a target enrichment next-generation sequencing method, and the presence of the viruses was confirmed by agent-specific qRT-PCR assays. For the first time in this patient cohort, complete genomes of HPgV-1 were acquired and characterized. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that two patients had HPgV-1 genotype 2 and one had HPgV-1 genotype 3. Intra-host genomic variations were described and discussed.

Mosquito survey in Mauritania: Detection of Rift Valley fever virus and dengue virus and the determination of feeding patterns								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				16	4					e0010203	10.1371/journal.pntd.0010203				APR 2022	2022	Author summaryIn Mauritania, various mosquito-borne viruses responsible for devastating diseases in livestock and/or humans occur, threatening both human and animal health. One of these viruses is the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), which is widespread throughout the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The first outbreak in Mauritania occurred in 1987, and epidemics have recurred since then. However, little is known about the maintenance of RVFV during inter-epidemic periods, in the absence of reported outbreaks, and although there is evidence of an active circulation of the virus during these times, only limited data are available on the abundance of RVFV and its vectors in Mauritania. Therefore, this study aimed to collect and examine mosquitoes in different areas where outbreaks have already occurred. Additionally, blood of collected blood-fed mosquitoes was analyzed to identify feeding patterns and thus wildlife potentially acting as RVFV reservoir hosts. Furthermore, the collected mosquitoes were analyzed for the presence of other neglected viruses in order to participate in an elucidation of the circulation of different viruses within the mosquito population in Mauritania and to be able to better prevent disease outbreaks.In Mauritania, several mosquito-borne viruses have been reported that can cause devastating diseases in animals and humans. However, monitoring data on their occurrence and local distribution are limited. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that causes major outbreaks throughout the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The first Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in Mauritania occurred in 1987 and since then the country has been affected by recurrent outbreaks of the disease. To gain information on the occurrence of RVFV as well as other mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors in Mauritania, we collected and examined 4,950 mosquitoes, belonging to four genera and 14 species. The mosquitoes were captured during 2018 in the capital Nouakchott and in southern parts of Mauritania. Evidence of RVFV was found in a mosquito pool of female Anopheles pharoensis mosquitoes collected in December on a farm near the Senegal River. At that time, 37.5% of 16 tested Montbeliarde cattle on the farm showed RVFV-specific IgM antibodies. Additionally, we detected IgM antibodies in 10.7% of 28 indigenous cattle that had been sampled on the same farm one month earlier. To obtain information on potential RVFV reservoir hosts, blood meals captured engorged mosquitoes were analyzed. The mosquitoes mainly fed on humans (urban areas) and cattle (rural areas), but also on small ruminants, donkeys, cats, dogs and straw-colored fruit bats. Results of this study demonstrate the circulation of RVFV in Mauritania and thus the need for further research to investigate the distribution of the virus and its vectors. Furthermore, factors that may contribute to its maintenance should be analyzed more closely. In addition, two mosquito pools containing Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes showed evidence of dengue virus (DENV) 2 circulation in the city of Rosso.

Inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Infection by Human Defensin HNP1 and Retrocyclin RC-101								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				434	6	SI				167225	10.1016/j.jmb.2021.167225				MAR 30 2022	2022	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergence of new potentially more transmissible and vaccine-resistant variants of SARS-CoV-2 is an ever-present threat. Thus, it remains essential to better understand innate immune mechanisms that can inhibit the virus. One component of the innate immune system with broad antipathogen, including antiviral, activity is a group of cationic immune peptides termed defensins. The ability of defensins to neutralize enveloped and non-enveloped viruses and to inactivate numerous bacterial toxins correlate with their ability to promote the unfolding of proteins with high conformational plasticity. We found that human neutrophil a-defensin HNP1 binds to SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein with submicromolar affinity that is more than 20 fold stronger than its binding to serum albumin. As such, HNP1, as well as a 0-defensin retrocyclin RC-101, both interfere with Spike-mediated membrane fusion, Spike-pseudotyped lentivirus infection, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. These effects correlate with the abilities of the defensins to destabilize and precipitate Spike protein and inhibit the interaction of Spike with the ACE2 receptor. Serum reduces the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of HNP1, though at high concentrations, HNP1 was able to inactivate the virus even in the presence of serum. Overall, our results suggest that defensins can negatively affect the native conformation of SARS-CoV-2 Spike, and that a-and 0-defensins may be valuable tools in developing SARS-CoV-2 infection prevention strategies.(c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Numerous genes that contribute to this antiviral state remain to be identified. Using a loss-of-function strategy, we screened an original library of 1156 siRNAs targeting 386 individual curated human genes in stimulated microglial cells infected with Zika virus (ZIKV), an emerging RNA virus that belongs to the flavivirus genus. The screen recovered twenty-one potential host proteins that modulate ZIKV replication in an IFN-dependent manner, including the previously known IFITM3 and LY6E. Further characterization contributed to delineate the spectrum of action of these genes towards other pathogenic RNA viruses, including Hepatitis C virus and SARS-CoV-2. Our data revealed that APOL3 acts as a proviral factor for ZIKV and several other related and unrelated RNA viruses. In addition, we showed that MTA2, a chromatin remodeling factor, possesses potent flavivirus-specific antiviral functions induced by IFN. Our work identified previously unrecognized genes that modulate the replication of RNA viruses in an IFN-dependent manner, opening new perspectives to target weakness points in the life cycle of these viruses.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

SARS-CoV-2 induces syncytia when the viral spike (S) protein on the surface of an infected cell interacts with receptors on neighboring cells. Syncytia may potentially contribute to pathology by facilitating viral dissemination, cytopathicity, immune evasion, and inflammatory response. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern possess several mutations within the S protein that enhance receptor interaction, fusogenicity and antibody binding. In this review, we discuss the molec-ular determinants of S mediated fusion and the antiviral innate immunity components that counteract syn-cytia formation. Several interferon-stimulated genes, including IFITMs and LY6E act as barriers to S protein-mediated fusion by altering the composition or biophysical properties of the target membrane. We also summarize the effect that the mutations associated with the variants of concern have on S protein fusogenicity. Altogether, this review contextualizes the current understanding of Spike fusogenicity and the role of syncytia during SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathology. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

The broadly active innate immune response puts a strong selective pressure on viruses and drives the selection of variants with increased capabilities to subvert the induction and function of antiviral cytokines. This revolutionary process dynamically shapes the host ranges, cell tropism and pathogenesis of viruses. Recent studies on the innate immune responses to the infection of human coronaviruses (HCoV), particularly SARS-CoV-2, revealed that HCoV infections can be sensed by endosomal toll-like receptors and/or cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors in various cell types. However, the profiles of inflammatory cytokines and transcriptome response induced by a specific HCoV are usually cell type specific and determined by the virus-specific mechanisms of subverting the induction and function of interferons and inflammatory cytokines as well as the genetic trait of the host genes of innate immune pathways. We review herein the recent literatures on the innate immune responses and their roles in the pathogenesis of HCoV infections with emphasis on the pathobiological roles and therapeutic effects of type I interferons in HCoV infections and their antiviral mechanisms. The knowledge on the mechanism of innate immune control of HCoV infections and viral evasions should facilitate the development of therapeutics for induction of immune resolution of HCoV infections and vaccines for efficient control of COVID-19 pandemics and other HCoV infections.

The entry of HNVs into host cells requires the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, which are the main targets of antibody responses. To understand viral infection and host immunity, we determined a cryo-electron microscopy structure of the NiV G homotetrameric ectodomain in complex with the nAH1.3 broadly neutralizing antibody Fab fragment. We show that a cocktail of two nonoverlapping G-specific antibodies neutralizes NiV and HeV synergistically and limits the emergence of escape mutants. Analysis of polyclonal serum antibody responses elicited by vaccination of macaques with NiV G indicates that the receptor binding head domain is immunodominant. These results pave the way for implementing multipronged therapeutic strategies against these deadly pathogens.																					WOS:000778894800036	35239409

A case report								BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH				18	1					111	10.1186/s12917-022-03191-x				MAR 22 2022	2022	Background Interstitial lung disease is a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by severe radiographic changes and clinicopathological findings. However, in the vast majority of cases, the cause remains unknown. Case description In the present study, we reported the clinical case of a 3 years old female Bull Terrier presented in October 2020 to the Advanced Diagnostic Imaging Department of the Turin Veterinary Teaching Hospital with a progressive pulmonary illness characterized by dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and a diffuse and severe pulmonary interstitial pattern at imaging investigations. Considering the clinical findings, the dog was included in a serological survey for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in companion animals, showing positive results. Due to the further clinical worsening, the owners opted for euthanasia. At necroscopy, dog showed severe and chronic bronchopneumonia compatible with a Canine Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis and with serological features linked to a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Conclusions The comparison of these lesions with those reported in humans affected by Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) supports the hypothesis that these findings may be attributable to the post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dog with breed predisposition to Canine Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (CIPF), although direct evidence of SARS-CoV-2 by molecular or antigenic approaches remained unsolved.

Restriction factor screening identifies RABGAP1L-mediated disruption of endocytosis as a host antiviral defense								CELL REPORTS				38	12					110549	10.1016/j.celrep.2022.110549				MAR 22 2022	2022	Host interferons (IFNs) powerfully restrict viruses through the action of several hundred IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products, many of which remain uncharacterized. Here, using RNAi screening, we identify several ISG restriction factors with previously undescribed contributions to IFN-mediated defense. Notably, RABGAP1L, a Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16 (TBC)-domain-containing protein involved in regulation of small membrane-bound GTPases, robustly potentiates IFN action against influenza A viruses (IAVs). Functional studies reveal that the catalytically active TBC domain of RABGAP1L promotes antiviral activity, and the RABGAP1L proximal interactome uncovered its association with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, maturation, and trafficking. In this regard, RABGAP1L overexpression is sufficient to disrupt endosomal function during IAV infection and restricts an early post-attachment, but pre-fusion, stage of IAV cell entry. Other RNA viruses that enter cells primarily via endocytosis are also impaired by RABGAP1L, while entry promiscuous SARSCoV-2 is resistant. Our data highlight virus endocytosis as a key target for host defenses.																					WOS:000776436000005	35320721

Serological Evidence of Antibodies to Rift Valley Fever Virus in Wild and Domestic Animals in Bauchi State, Nigeria								VETERINARY MEDICINE INTERNATIONAL				2022						6559193	10.1155/2022/6559193				MAR 16 2022	2022	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne zoonotic disease responsible for severe outbreaks in livestock and humans with concomitant economic losses in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The study, therefore, investigated the seroprevalence of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) among wild and domestic animals. Blood samples were collected between 2013 and 2015 from 106 wild animals, 300 cattle (Bos indicus), and 200 horses (Equus caballus), respectively, in Yankari Game Reserve (YGR) and Sumu Wildlife Park (SWP) in Bauchi state, Nigeria. Harvested sera from blood were evaluated for the presence of anti-RVFV IgM/IgG antibodies. The overall seroprevalence in cattle was 11.3% (p = 0.677; 95% CI: 0.624-0.730) and in wildlife was 8.5% (p = 0.006; 95% CI: 0.00-0.60). The diversity of wildlife species sampled indicated seropositivity of 36.0% in waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymus), 25.0% in elephant (Loxodonta africana), 12.5% in eland (Taurotragus oryx), and 8.3% in wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus). Whereas, samples from zebra (Equus quagga crawshayi), kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros), and hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus caama) did not show detectable antibodies to RVFV, and seroprevalence in female (15.0%) wildlife species was higher than in males (4.5%) (p = 0.061). Classification of cattle into breed and sex showed no significant difference in seropositivity. Seropositivity of 12.0% was observed in White Fulani, 12.1% in Red Bororo, and 7.8% in Sokoto Gudali breeds of cattle (p = 0.677). Whereas, seropositivity of 13.6% was observed in females and 6.4% observed in males (p = 0.068). This study indicated the presence of antibodies to RVFV among some wild animals and cattle in the absence of a reported outbreak in the study area. The circulation of RVFV in the study area may pose a significant health risk to livestock, wildlife, and humans. Therefore, surveillance for RVFV should be intensified targeting mosquito vectors and humans in Bauchi state, Nigeria.																					WOS:000783703400001	35340539

The prodrug, initially invented for respiratory syncytial virus, was later found to have activity toward emerging RNA viruses, including Ebola and coronaviruses. Remdesivir is among the first examples of a phosphoramidate prodrug aimed at delivering a nucleoside monophosphate into lung cells to efficiently generate the nucleoside triphosphate inhibitor of viral RNA polymerases. With remdesivir as the central case study, the present work describes the antiviral potency and in vitro metabolism evidence for lung cell activation of phosphoramidates, together with their in vivo pharmacokinetics, lung distribution, and antiviral efficacy toward respiratory viruses. The lung delivery of nucleoside monophosphate analogs using prodrugs warrants further investigation toward the development of novel respiratory antivirals.

There is currently no approved vaccine against RSV infection, and the only available prevention is immunoprophylaxis utilized in high-risk infants, leaving the elderly without many options. In the elderly, the chronic low-grade inflammatory state of the body can play a significant role during infection. The cotton rat and mouse have emerged as the preferred small animal models to study RSV infection in the elderly. These animal models of aging have shown an age-dependent time course for clearance of virus correlating with a significantly diminished cytotoxic T lymphocyte and humoral immune response in old animals compared to adult animals. In addition, protection through vaccination is reduced in aging rodents. These results mirror the findings in humans. In mice and cotton rats, treatment with ibuprofen, a nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to decrease the chronic low-grade inflammation of the elderly immune system has proven successful in restoring the function of cytotoxic lymphocytes. While more research is required, these treatment types promise a beneficial effect in addition to a putative vaccine. Choosing an appropriate animal model to study RSV infection in the aging immune system is essential to benefit the growing population of elderly in the world. This review focuses on the current research of RSV infection in the cotton rat and mouse as model systems for an aging immune system.																					WOS:000773698100001	35309598

In comparison to HCV, HPgV-1 seems to be lymphotropic and connected to the viral group that infects T and B lymphocytes. HPgV-1 infection is not persuasively correlated to any known human disease; nevertheless, multiple studies have reported a connection between chronic HPgV-1 infection and improved survival in HPgV-1/HIV co-infected patients with a delayed and favorable impact on HIV infection development. While the process has not been thoroughly clarified, different mechanisms for these observations have been proposed. HPgV-1 is categorized into seven genotypes and various subtypes. Infection with HPgV-1 is relatively common globally. It can be transferred parenterally, sexually, and through vertical ways, and thereby its co-infection with HIV and HCV is common. In most cases, the clearance of HPgV-1 from the body can be achieved by developing E2 antibodies after infection. Main body In this review, we thoroughly discuss the current knowledge and recent advances in understanding distinct epidemiological, molecular, and clinical aspects of HPgV-1. Conclusion Due to the unique characteristics of the HPgV-1, so advanced research on HPgV-1, particularly in light of HIV co-infection and other diseases, should be conducted to explore the essential mechanisms of HIV clearance and other viruses and thereby suggest novel strategies for viral therapy in the future.

Despite having been discovered 25 years ago, there is still much to know regarding HPgV-1 clinical impact, as this virus is currently not associated with any pathology. Yet, HPgV-1 prevalence and molecular characterization are still unknown in many countries, including Portugal. To fill in this knowledge gap, this study aimed to determine the occurrence and molecular characterization of HPgV-1 in a group of healthy blood donors from the north of Portugal. Blood samples from 465 Portuguese blood donors were collected from a major Hospital Center in the north of Portugal. RNA was extracted and an initial nested RT-PCR was performed targeting the conserved 5 '-untranslated region region of the HPgV-1 genome. A second nested RT-PCR targeting the E2 region was performed for genotyping. Only one sample tested positive for HPgV-1 RNA, resulting in a prevalence of approximately 0.22%. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed the characterization as genotype 2, the most prevalent in Europe.																					WOS:000765826200001	35229315

Using whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis, we determined the variant had similar to 83% nt identity with prototypic HeV. In silico and in vitro comparisons of the receptor-binding protein with prototypic HeV support that the human monoclonal antibody m102.4 used for postexposure prophylaxis and current equine vaccine will be effective against this variant. An updated quantitative PCR developed for routine surveillance resulted in subsequent case detection. Genetic sequence consistency with virus detected in grey-headed flying foxes suggests the variant circulates at least among this species. Studies are needed to determine infection kinetics, pathogenicity, reservoir-species associations, viral-host coevolution, and spillover dynamics for this virus. Surveillance and biosecurity practices should be updated to acknowledge HeV spillover risk across all regions frequented by flying foxes.																					WOS:000771729200022	35202527

In this context, cases of human to animal transmission have been reported, raising concern about the potential role of companion animals in the pandemic and stressing the need for reliable animal testing. In the study, a detailed epitope mapping of SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, using both human and pet sera, allowed the identification of the most antigenic region in the C-terminus domain of the protein, which was used to develop an experimental double antigen-based ELISA. A panel of pre-pandemic sera and sera of animals immunized against (or naturally infected with) related coronaviruses was used to assess assay specificity at 99.5%. Positive sera belonging to animals housed with COVID-19 patients were confirmed with the experimental double-antigen ELISA using Plaque Reduction Neutralization test (PRNT) test as gold standard. The availability of a serolog-ical assay that targets a highly specific viral antigen represents a valuable tool for multispecies monitoring of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection in susceptible animals.

It is an emerging pathogen capable of causing a variety of clinical presentations, including encephalitis and severe acute respiratory illness, which can be fatal. Interestingly, it can also cause asymptomatic infections, which can relapse after a long period of time ranging from months to years following initial infection. Zoonotic transmission involves bats or pigs. In addition, transmission via contaminated food and occasional human to human direct transmission may also occur. It can have diverse epidemiological features and can have a very high case fatality ratio. Although a variety of immunological and molecular assays have been developed and epidemiological monitoring procedures for this disease have been introduced, there are no drugs available for this virus. Vaccines are at different stages of development. In this mini-review, we present the latest information on the Nipah virus; primarily focusing on emergence, transmission, pathogenic mechanisms and possible prophylactic and treatment options.

Nasal swabs from 667 equids with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs were tested by qPCR for SARS-CoV-2. Further, 633 serum samples collected from a cohort of 587 healthy racing Thoroughbreds with possible exposure to humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA targeting the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. All 667 horses with fever and respiratory signs tested qPCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2. A total of 35/587 (5.9%) Thoroughbred racing horses had detectable IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. While horses appear to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 when in close contact with humans with SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical disease was not observed in the study horses. Experimental challenge studies using pure inocula are needed in order to study the clinical, hematological, molecular, and serological features of adult horses infected with SARS-CoV-2. More and more studies are reporting on the natural transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans with COVID-19 and their companion animals (dogs and cats). While horses are apparently susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection based on the homology between the human and the equine ACE-2 receptor, no clinical or subclinical infection has yet been reported in the equine species. To investigate the possible clinical role of SARS-CoV-2 in equids, nasal secretions from 667 horses with acute onset of fever and respiratory signs were tested for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 by qPCR. The samples were collected from January to December of 2020 and submitted to a commercial molecular diagnostic laboratory for the detection of common respiratory pathogens (equine influenza virus, equine herpesvirus-1/-4, equine rhinitis A and B virus, Streptococcus equi subspecies equi). An additional 633 serum samples were tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 using an ELISA targeting the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein. The serum samples were collected from a cohort of 587 healthy racing Thoroughbreds in California after track personnel tested qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. While 241/667 (36%) equids with fever and respiratory signs tested qPCR-positive for at least one of the common respiratory pathogens, not a single horse tested qPCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2. Amongst the racing Thoroughbreds, 35/587 (5.9%) horses had detectable antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Similar to dogs and cats, horses do not seem to develop clinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, horses can act as incidental hosts and experience silent infection following spillover from humans with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2-infected humans should avoid close contact with equids during the time of their illness.																					WOS:000768118200001	35268183

All samples were tested by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) using specific genes N and ORF1ab in Pasteur Institute of Iran, and then partial sequence analyses of S gene were performed. All collected cats were kept in separated cages until SARS-COV-2 infection was confirmed with the RT-PCR.RT-PCR Ct values of 123 collected cats were & GE;40; thus, all of them showed negative results, but one of the collected cats with close contact with its owner, whom confirmed SARS-CoV-2 showed positive results with gene N(Ct=30) and gene ORF1ab (Ct=32). Furthermore, the positive pet cat showed respiratory and gastro-intestinal clinical manifestations, and its owner was infected with SARS-CoV-2 two weeks ago.Cats are susceptible animals to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Epidemiological evidence showed that SARS-COV-2 is able to transmit to healthy cats due to having close contact with its owner as a reverse zoonosis.

Therefore, this meta-analysis study was performed to assay the effect of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, vitamin C on respiratory tract infections. Methods: In this systematic review of data on the effects of zinc, selenium, vitamin D and vitamin C on respiratory tract infections in the last 20 years in the world (2001-2020) with a review of 30 studies (5351 cases) including English and Persian articles, Reputable domestic and foreign sites were performed. Data were analyzed using meta-analysis. Finding: The odds ratio of respiratory tract infections in vitamin D users was estimated to be 0.797 (confidence interval 95%, 0.808-0.786). The Rate of odds of respiratory infections in consumers of vitamin C, 0.0496 (confidence interval 95%, 0.55-1.441) was estimated. The odds ratio of respiratory infections in zinc users was estimated to be 0.437 (confidence interval 95, 0.51-0.366). The odds ratio of respiratory tract infections in selenium users was estimated to be 0.624 (confidence interval 95, 0.696, 0.545). Results: Respiratory infections are seen in consumers of vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, selenium. Proper use of vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and selenium is essential in addition to monitoring the epidemiology of regional respiratory infections.																					WOS:000782264600028

As of January 2022 WHO statistics shows more than 5.6 million death and about 350 million infection by SARS-CoV-2. One of the life threatening aspects of COVID-19 is secondary infections and reduced efficacy of antibiotics against them. Since the beginning of COVID-19 many researches have been done on identification, treatment, and vaccine development. Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) could offer novel approaches to detect, treat and control COVID-19. Phage therapy and in particular using phage cocktails can be used to control or eliminate the bacterial pathogen as an alternative or complementary therapeutic agent. At the same time, phage interaction with the host immune system can regulate the inflammatory response. In addition, phage display and engineered synthetic phages can be utilized to develop new vaccines and antibodies, stimulate the immune system, and elicit a rapid and well-appropriate defense response. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 new variants like delta and omicron has proved the urgent need for precise, efficient and novel approaches for vaccine development and virus detection techniques in which bacteriophages may be one of the plausible solutions. Therefore, phages with similar morphology and/or genetic content to that of coronaviruses can be used for ecological and epidemiological modeling of SARS-CoV-2 behavior and future generations of coronavirus, and in general new viral pathogens. This article is a comprehensive review/perspective of potential applications of bacteriophages in the fight against the present pandemic and the post-COVID era.

This viewpoint advocates for countries to conduct prior efficacy studies before they embark on mass vaccination and addresses the role of nanoparticles as carrier vehicles for these vaccines with a view to explore the present challenges and forge a path for a stronger and more viable future for the development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemics. We also look at the emerging prophylactics and therapeutics in the light of ongoing cases of severe and critical COVID-19.																					WOS:000759645200001	35195017

Full Genome Nobecovirus Sequences From Malagasy Fruit Bats Define a Unique Evolutionary History for This Coronavirus Clade								FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH				10						786060	10.3389/fpubh.2022.786060				FEB 11 2022	2022	Bats are natural reservoirs for both Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses and the hypothesized original hosts of five of seven known zoonotic coronaviruses. To date, the vast majority of bat coronavirus research has been concentrated in Asia, though coronaviruses are globally distributed; indeed, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2-related Betacoronaviruses in the subgenus Sarbecovirus have been identified circulating in Rhinolophid bats in both Africa and Europe, despite the relative dearth of surveillance in these regions. As part of a long-term study examining the dynamics of potentially zoonotic viruses in three species of endemic Madagascar fruit bat (Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, Rousettus madagascariensis), we carried out metagenomic Next Generation Sequencing (mNGS) on urine, throat, and fecal samples obtained from wild-caught individuals. We report detection of RNA derived from Betacoronavirus subgenus Nobecovirus in fecal samples from all three species and describe full genome sequences of novel Nobecoviruses in P. rufus and R. madagascariensis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates the existence of five distinct Nobecovirus clades, one of which is defined by the highly divergent ancestral sequence reported here from P. rufus bats. Madagascar Nobecoviruses derived from P. rufus and R. madagascariensis demonstrate, respectively, Asian and African phylogeographic origins, mirroring those of their fruit bat hosts. Bootscan recombination analysis indicates significant selection has taken place in the spike, nucleocapsid, and NS7 accessory protein regions of the genome for viruses derived from both bat hosts. Madagascar offers a unique phylogeographic nexus of bats and viruses with both Asian and African phylogeographic origins, providing opportunities for unprecedented mixing of viral groups and, potentially, recombination. As fruit bats are handled and consumed widely across Madagascar for subsistence, understanding the landscape of potentially zoonotic coronavirus circulation is essential for mitigation of future zoonotic threats.

White-tailed deer, the predominant cervid in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV- 2 infection, and experimentally infected fawns can transmit the virus. To test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in deer, 283 retropharyngeal lymph node (RPLN) samples collected from 151 freeliving and 132 captive deer in Iowa from April 2020 through January of 2021 were assayed for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Ninety-four of the 283 (33.2%) deer samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA as assessed by RT-PCR. Notably, following the November 2020 peak of human cases in Iowa, and coinciding with the onset of winter and the peak deer hunting season, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 80 of 97 (82.5%) RPLN samples collected over a 7-wk period. Whole genome sequencing of all 94 positive RPLN samples identified 12 SARS-CoV-2 lineages, with B.1.2 (n = 51; 54.5%) and B.1.311 (n = 19; 20%) accounting for similar to 75% of all samples. The geographic distribution and nesting of clusters of deer and human lineages strongly suggest multiple human-to-deer transmission events followed by subsequent deer-to-deer spread. These discoveries have important implications for the long-term persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Our findings highlight an urgent need for a robust and proactive "One Health" approach to obtain enhanced understanding of the ecology, molecular evolution, and dissemination of SARS-CoV-2.

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computing systems based on the topology of the biological brain, containing connected artificial neurons that can be tasked with solving medical problems. Aim: We expanded the previously presented HCV micro-elimination project started in September 2020 that aimed to identify HCV infection through coordinated screening in asymptomatic populations and developed two ANN models able to identify at-risk subjects selected through a targeted questionnaire. Material and method: Our study included 14,042 screened participants from a southwestern region of Oltenia, Romania. Each participant completed a 12-item questionnaire along with anti-HCV antibody rapid testing. Hepatitis-C-positive subjects were linked to care and ultimately could receive antiviral treatment if they had detectable viremia. We built two ANNs, trained and tested on the dataset derived from the questionnaires and then used to identify patients in a similar, already existing dataset. Results: We found 114 HCV-positive patients (81 females), resulting in an overall prevalence of 0.81%. We identified sharing personal hygiene items, receiving blood transfusions, having dental work or surgery and re-using hypodermic needles as significant risk factors. When used on an existing dataset of 15,140 persons (119 HCV cases), the first ANN models correctly identified 97 (81.51%) HCV-positive subjects through 13,401 tests, while the second ANN model identified 81 (68.06%) patients through only 5192 tests. Conclusions: The use of ANNs in selecting screening candidates may improve resource allocation and prioritize cases more prone to severe disease.																					WOS:000764212800001	35204437

A range of animal species have been verified for SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, either in vitro or in vivo. However, the molecular bases of such a broad host spectrum for the SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive. Here, we structurally and genetically analysed the interaction between the spike protein, with a particular focus on receptor binding domains (RBDs), of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for all conceivably susceptible groups of animals to gauge the structural bases of the SARS-CoV-2 host spectrum. We describe our findings in the context of existing animal infection-based models to provide a foundation on the possible virus persistence in animals and their implications in the future eradication of COVID-19.

In this study, we reported the results of molecular and serological surveys on migrating birds sampled during peaks of spring and autumn migration at 11 Italian sites located along important flyways, from 2012 to 2014. A total of 1335 specimens made of individual or pooled sera, and organs from 275 dead birds were tested for WNV and USUV RNA by real time PCR (RT-PCR). Furthermore, sera were tested by serum neutralization assay for detecting WNV and USUV neutralizing antibodies. Molecular tests detected WNV lineage 2 RNA in a pool made of three Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) sera sampled in autumn, and lineage 1 in kidneys of six trans-Saharan birds sampled in spring. Neutralizing antibodies against WNV and USUV were found in 5.80% (n = 72; 17 bird species) and 0.32% (n = 4; 4 bird species) of the tested sera, respectively. Our results do not exclude the role of migratory birds as potential spreaders of WNV and USUV from Africa and Central Europe to Mediterranean areas and highlight the importance of a more extensive active surveillance of zoonotic viruses.

The RVFV MP-12 vaccine strain is known to exhibit residual virulence in the case of a deficient interferon type 1 response. The hypothesis of this study is that virus replication and severity of lesions induced by the MP-12 strain in immunocompromised mice depend on the specific function of the disturbed pathway. Therefore, 10 strains of mice with deficient innate immunity (B6-IFNAR(tmAgt), C.129S7(B6)-Ifng(tm1Ts)/J, B6-TLR3(tm1Flv), B6-TLR7(tm1Aki), NOD/ShiLtJ), helper T-cell- (CD4(tm1Mak)), cytotoxic T-cell- (CD8(atm1Mak)), B-cell- (Igh-J(tm1Dhu)N?+N2), combined T- and B-cell- (NU/J) and combined T-, B-, natural killer (NK) cell- and macrophage-mediated immunity (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rg(tm1WjI)/SzJ (NSG) mice) were subcutaneously infected with RVFV MP-12. B6-IFNAR(tmAgt) mice were the only strain to develop fatal disease due to RVFV-induced severe hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis. Notably, no clinical disease and only mild multifocal hepatocellular necrosis and apoptosis were observed in NSG mice, while immunohistochemistry detected the RVFV antigen in the liver and the brain. No or low virus expression and no lesions were observed in the other mouse strains. Conclusively, the interferon type 1 response is essential for early control of RVFV replication and disease, whereas functional NK cells, macrophages and lymphocytes are essential for virus clearance.

In this model, male and female golden Syrian hamsters were inoculated intranasally with SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020. Groups of inoculated and mockinoculated uninfected control animals were euthanized at 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 days after inoculation to track consistently lost body weight during the first week of infection, had higher lung weights at terminal time points, and developed lung consolidation per histopathology and quantitative image analysis measurements. High levels of infectious virus and viral RNA were reliably present in the respiratory tract at days 2 and 4 after inoculation, corresponding with widespread necrosis and inflammation. At day 7, when the presence of infectious virus was rare, interstitial and alveolar macrophage infiltrates and marked reparative epithelial responses (type II hyperplasia) dominated in the lung. These lesions resolved over time, with only residual epithelial repair evident by day 28 after inoculation. The use of quantitative approaches to measure cellular and morphologic alterations in the lung provides valuable outcome measures for developing therapeutic and preventive interventions for COVID-19 using the hamster COVID-19 model.

Identifying Inhibitors of-1 Programmed Ribosomal Frameshifting in a Broad Spectrum of Coronaviruses								VIRUSES-BASEL				14	2					177	10.3390/v14020177				FEB 2022	2022	Recurrent outbreaks of novel zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) diseases in recent years have highlighted the importance of developing therapeutics with broad-spectrum activity against CoVs. Because all CoVs use -1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) to control expression of key viral proteins, the frameshift signal in viral mRNA that stimulates -1 PRF provides a promising potential target for such therapeutics. To test the viability of this strategy, we explored whether small-molecule inhibitors of -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2 also inhibited -1 PRF in a range of bat CoVs-the most likely source of future zoonoses. Six inhibitors identified in new and previous screens against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated against the frameshift signals from a panel of representative bat CoVs as well as MERS-CoV. Some drugs had strong activity against subsets of these CoV-derived frameshift signals, while having limited to no effect on -1 PRF caused by frameshift signals from other viruses used as negative controls. Notably, the serine protease inhibitor nafamostat suppressed -1 PRF significantly for multiple CoV-derived frameshift signals. These results suggest it is possible to find small-molecule ligands that inhibit -1 PRF specifically in a broad spectrum of CoVs, establishing frameshift signals as a viable target for developing pan-coronaviral therapeutics.

Epidemiological studies suggest that there is similar variability in susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. We propose that natural resistance is part of the disease history in some individuals exposed to this new coronavirus. Epidemiological arguments for natural resistance to SARS-CoV-2 are the lower seropositivity of children compared to adults, studies on closed environments of ships with outbreaks, and prevalence studies in some developing countries. Potential mechanisms of natural resistance include host genetic variants, viral interference, cross-protective natural antibodies, T cell immunity, and highly effective innate immune responses. Better understanding of natural resistance can help to advance preventive and therapeutic measures against infections for improved preparedness against potential future pandemics.

PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH				71	1			47	54		10.33549/physiolres.934827				FEB 2022	2022	Few peculiarities have been observed in the etiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), one such being its greater prevalence in men than women partly due to the higher expressions of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) in the male reproductive tissues. Recent scientific reports are in line with some of the evidence-based hypotheses in the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, regarding the involvement of oxidative stress (OS) and oxidant-sensitive pathways in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-mediated male reproductive disruptions. The seminal dissemination of SARS-CoV-2 or its components, testicular disruptions due to viral infection and oxidative damage in the testis have all been evidenced recently. High-dose of antioxidants, such as vitamin C, have been shown to be a useful treatment for COVID-19 patients, to alleviate systemic inflammation and OS. In addition, vitamin C is a major testicular antioxidant that neutralizes excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevents sperm agglutination, prevents lipid peroxidation, recycles vitamin E, and protects against DNA damage. Thus, the present review aims to discuss the mechanism of COVID-19-mediated male reproductive dysfunctions, based on the evidence available so far, and explore the possibility of using vitamin C in alleviating testicular OS and associated damage caused by COVID-19.

Apart from the oxygen therapy and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, Remdesivir and Dexamethasone have been proven to be efficacious against COVID-19, along with various vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibody cocktail therapy for Regeneron. All of these are currently at different stages of clinical trials. People with weak immunity are more prone to a severe infection of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, early and judicious nutritional supplementation along with pharmacological treatment and clinician collaborations are critical in restituting the current situation. Nutritional supplements help in acquiring strong immunity to prevent the progression of disease any further. Vitamin C, vitamin D, selenium, zinc and many other nutritional and dietary supplements inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines during a viral infection and prevents several unwanted symptoms of infection. Many dietary components like citrus fruits, black elderberry, ginger, and probiotics have the ability to attack viral replication. These supplements can also tame the overriding immune system during coronavirus infection. Keeping in view these facts, nutritional and dietary supplements can be used along with other management modalities. These nutritional and dietary supplements are potential candidates to curb the convulsive unfolding of novel COVID-19, in combination with other standard treatment protocols. In this review, various search engines were used to exploit available literature in order to provide a comprehensive review on nutritional and dietary supplements with respect to the viral infections. It will also provide a brief overview on some of the clinical trials that are in progress to assess the role of nutritional supplements, either alone or in combination with other pharmacological drugs, in fight against COVID-19.

Plant-Derived Recombinant Vaccines against Zoonotic Viruses								LIFE-BASEL				12	2					156	10.3390/life12020156				FEB 2022	2022	Emerging and re-emerging zoonotic diseases cause serious illness with billions of cases, and millions of deaths. The most effective way to restrict the spread of zoonotic viruses among humans and animals and prevent disease is vaccination. Recombinant proteins produced in plants offer an alternative approach for the development of safe, effective, inexpensive candidate vaccines. Current strategies are focused on the production of highly immunogenic structural proteins, which mimic the organizations of the native virion but lack the viral genetic material. These include chimeric viral peptides, subunit virus proteins, and virus-like particles (VLPs). The latter, with their ability to self-assemble and thus resemble the form of virus particles, are gaining traction among plant-based candidate vaccines against many infectious diseases. In this review, we summarized the main zoonotic diseases and followed the progress in using plant expression systems for the production of recombinant proteins and VLPs used in the development of plant-based vaccines against zoonotic viruses.

The Nipah virus (NiV) belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family was reported in Malaysia in 1998/1999. Due to its high mortality in humans, its zoonotic nature, the possibility of human-to-human transmission, and the lack of an available vaccine, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized it as a global health problem. Depending on strain specificity, neurological symptoms and severe respiratory disorders are observed in NiV infection. In most confirmed cases of NiV epidemics, the appearance of the virus in humans was associated with the presence of various animal species, but generally, bats of Pteropus species are considered the most important natural animal NiV reservoir and vector. Consumption of contaminated food, contact with animals, and "human-to-human" direct contact were identified as NiV transmission routes. Due to the lack of vaccines and drugs with proven effectiveness against NiV, treatment of patients is limited to supportive and prophylactic.																					WOS:000752589200001	35145498

Those documented in animals are typically mild and self-limiting, and infected animals have only infrequently died or been euthanized. Through a coordinated One Health initiative, necropsies were conducted on 5 animals from different premises that were exposed to humans with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The combination of epidemiologic evidence of exposure and confirmatory real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing confirmed infection in 3 cats and a tiger. A dog was a suspect case based on epidemiologic evidence of exposure but tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Four animals had respiratory clinical signs that developed 2 to 12 days after exposure. The dog had bronchointerstitial pneumonia and the tiger had bronchopneumonia; both had syncytial-like cells with no detection of SARS-CoV-2. Individual findings in the 3 cats included metastatic mammary carcinoma, congenital renal disease, and myocardial disease. Based on the necropsy findings and a standardized algorithm, SARS-CoV-2 infection was not considered the cause of death in any of the cases. Continued surveillance and necropsy examination of animals with fatal outcomes will further our understanding of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and the potential role of the virus in development of lesions.

Although several vaccines have been developed, none have succeeded in part due to our incomplete understanding of the correlates of immune protection. While both T cells and antibodies play a role, emerging data suggest that antibody-mediated mechanisms alone may be sufficient to provide protection. Therefore, to map the humoral correlates of immunity against RSV, antibody responses across six different vaccines were profiled in a highly controlled nonhuman primate-challenge model. Viral loads were monitored in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, and machine learning was used to determine the vaccine platform-agnostic antibody features associated with protection. Upper respiratory control was associated with virus-specific IgA levels, neutralization, and complement activity, whereas lower respiratory control was associated with Fc-mediated effector mechanisms. These findings provide critical compartment -specific insights toward the rational development of future vaccines.																					WOS:000748500900010	34879230

A total of 523 swab samples (nasal, oral, and rectal swabs) and 159 serum samples from dogs (n = 83) and cats (n = 93) were collected and tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies. All swab samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by real-time RT-PCR with three panels of specific primers and probes. Although all dogs and cats were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 3.14% (5/159) had anti-N-IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 by indirect multispecies ELISA. Our results demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 exposure in domestic animals living in high-risk areas during the second wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Thailand. Thus, the use of one health approach for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 in domestic animals in high-risk areas of COVID-19 outbreaks should be routinely conducted and will provide benefits to risk communications in communities.

To respond to these changes, supply chains need to quickly adapt to the new situation. This paper presents a review of literature that addresses supply chains under disruptions due to COVID-19 pandemic. Papers are classified based on issues addressed. The major findings or recommendations are discussed. These include the rising importance of safety, digitalisation, localisation, the need to revisit the meaning of efficiency, and the production and distribution of COVID-19 vaccine. We show that most mitigation actions proposed prior to COVID-19 such as redundancy and flexibility are still considered as possible strategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions due to COVID-19, but there are stronger pressures for digitalisation and supply-based localisation. The research agenda is also outlined at the end of the paper.																					WOS:000753750100006		
J	Ahmad, Faisal; Albutti, Aqel; Tariq, Muhammad Hamza; Din, Ghufranud; Tahir ul Qamar, Muhammad; Ahmad, Sajjad								Discovery of Potential Antiviral Compounds against Hendra Virus by Targeting Its Receptor-Binding Protein (G) Using Computational Approaches								MOLECULES				27	2					554	10.3390/molecules27020554				JAN 2022	2022	Hendra virus (HeV) belongs to the paramyxoviridae family of viruses which is associated with the respiratory distress, neurological illness, and potential fatality of the affected individuals. So far, no competitive approved therapeutic substance is available for HeV. For that reason, the current research work was conducted to propose some novel compounds, by adopting a Computer Aided Drug Discovery approach, which could be used to combat HeV. The G attachment Glycoprotein (Ggp) of HeV was selected to achieve the primary objective of this study, as this protein makes the entry of HeV possible in the host cells. Briefly, a library of 6000 antiviral compounds was screened for potential drug-like properties, followed by the molecular docking of short-listed compounds with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure of Ggp. Docked complexes of top two hits, having maximum binding affinities with the active sites of Ggp, were further considered for molecular dynamic simulations of 200 ns to elucidate the results of molecular docking analysis. MD simulations and Molecular Mechanics Energies combined with the Generalized Born and Surface Area (MMGBSA) or Poisson-Boltzmann and Surface Area (MMPBSA) revealed that both docked complexes are stable in nature. Furthermore, the same methodology was used between lead compounds and HeV Ggp in complex with its functional receptor in human, Ephrin-B2. Surprisingly, no major differences were found in the results, which demonstrates that our identified compounds can also perform their action even when the Ggp is attached to the Ephrin-B2 ligand. Therefore, in light of all of these results, we strongly suggest that compounds (S)-5-(benzylcarbamoyl)-1-(2-(4-methyl-2-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-oxoethyl)-6-oxo-3,6-dihydropyridin-1-ium-3-ide and 5-(cyclohexylcarbamoyl)-1-(2-((2-(3-fluorophenyl)-2-methylpropyl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-6-oxo-3,6-dihydropyridin-1-ium-3-ide could be considered as potential therapeutic agents against HeV; however, further in vitro and in vivo experiments are required to validate this study.

The nasal cavity is the promising gateway of SARS-CoV-2 to reach the brain via systemic circulatory distribution. Recent reports have revealed that the loss of involuntary process of breathing control into the brainstem that results in death is a signal of neuro-logical involvement. Early neurological symptoms, like loss of smell, convulsions, and ataxia, are the clues of the involvement of the central nervous system that makes the entry of SARS-CoV-2 further fatal and life-threatening, requiring artificial respiration and emergency admission in hospi-tals. Studies performed on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 has revealed three-stage involve-ment of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in the progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection: Direct in-volvement of CNS with headache, ataxia, dizziness, altered or impaired consciousness, acute stroke or seizures as major symptoms, peripheral involvement with impaired taste, smell, vision, and altered nociception, and skeletal muscle impairment that includes skeletal muscle disorders leading to acute paralysis in a particular area of the body. In the previous era, most studied and re-searched viruses were beta coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus, which were studied for acute and chronic encephalitis and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Although the early symptoms of SARS-CoV are respiratory pathogenesis, the differential diagnosis should always be considered for neurologi -cal perspective to stop the mortalities.

The susceptibility of young domestic swine to RVFV and this species' role in geographic expansion and establishment of viral endemicity is unclear. Six commercially bred Landrace-cross piglets were inoculated subcutaneously with 105 plaque-forming units of RVFV ZH501 strain and two piglets received a sham inoculum. All animals were monitored for clinical signs, viremia, viral shed-ding, and antibody response for 14 days. Piglets did not develop evidence of clinical disease, become febrile, or experi-ence decreased weight gain during the study period. A brief lymphopenia followed by progressive lymphocytosis was observed following inoculation in all piglets. Four piglets developed a brief viremia for 2 days post-inoculation and three of these had detectable virus in oronasal secretions three days post-inoculation. Primary inoculated piglets serocon-verted and those that developed detectable viremias had the highest titers assessed by serum neutralization (1:64-1:256). Two viremic piglets had a lymphoplasmacytic encephalitis with glial nodules; RVFV was not detected by immunohistochemistry in these sections. While young piglets do not appear to readily develop clinical disease following RVFV infection, results suggest swine could be subclinically infected with RVFV.

The advent of efficient methods for isolating broad and potently neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies is enabling us to develop antibodies with unprecedented activities. The discovery of IgG Fc region modifications that extend antibody half-life in humans to three months or more suggests that antibodies could become the principal tool with which we manage future viral epidemics. Antibodies for members of most virus families that cause severe disease in humans have been isolated, and many of them are in clinical development, an area that has accelerated during the effort to prevent or treat COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). Broad and potently neutralizing antibodies are also important research reagents for identification of protective epitopes that can be engineered into active vaccines through structure-based reverse vaccinology.

Whether vertebrates other than humans are involved in ZIKV transmission cycles remained unclear. Here, we investigate the role of different animals as ZIKV reservoirs by testing 1723 sera of pets, peri-domestic animals and African non-human primates (NHP) sampled during 2013-2018 in Brazil and 2006-2016 in Cote d'Ivoire. Exhaustive neutralization testing substantiated co-circulation of multiple flaviviruses and failed to confirm ZIKV infection in pets or peri-domestic animals in Cote d'Ivoire (n=259) and Brazil (n=1416). In contrast, ZIKV seroprevalence was 22.2% (2/9, 95% CI, 2.8-60.1) in West African chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and 11.1% (1/9, 95% CI, 0.3-48.3) in king colobus (Colobus polycomos). Our results indicate that while NHP may represent ZIKV reservoirs in Africa, pets or peri-domestic animals likely do not play a role in ZIKV transmission cycles.

SARS-CoV-2: the prospects of the virus spreading and the course of the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection in various species of animals								SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT				17	1			6	16		10.18470/1992-1098-2022-1-6-16				2022	2022	Aim. Analyse available literature data about the possibility of coronavirus infection with and the severity of the course of infection in various animal species in order to evaluate the significance of this possibility in the context of preservation of the well-being of both wild and domestic animals.Discussion. SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated from bat CoV. The virus enters the cell by binding to the ACE2 receptor, the affinity for which differs depending on the animal species. Infected animals show viral RNA and may show clinical symptoms. It is known that the virus originated from some animals, while others may be carriers. Moreover, it can be that wild as well as domestic and farm animals are in close contact with humans. Therefore, it is advisable to conduct a study of the degree of threat to humans associated with the persistence of the virus in animal communities.Conclusion. There is ample literature on the possibility of infection in various animals. However, it is not enough to fully understand how significant is the role that animals can play in the spread of coronavirus infection among humans and how much harm it can bring to themselves.

Several spillover events from bats to humans have been reported, causing severe epidemic or endemic diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV), henipaviruses, and filoviruses. In this study, a novel rhabdovirus species, provisionally named Rhinolophus rhabdovirus DPuer (DPRV), was identified from the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus affinis) in Yunnan province, China, using next-generation sequencing. DPRV shedding in the spleen, liver, lung, and intestinal contents of wild bats with high viral loads was detected by real-time quantitative PCR, indicating that DPRV has tropism for multiple host tissues. Furthermore, DPRV can replicate in vitro in multiple mammalian cell lines, including BHK-21, A549, and MA104 cells, with the highest efficiency in hamster kidney cell line BHK-21, suggesting infectivity of DPRV in these cell line-derived hosts. Ultrastructure analysis revealed a characteristic bullet-shaped morphology and tightly clustered distribution of DPRV particles in the intracellular space. DPRV replicated efficiently in suckling mouse brains and caused death of suckling mice; death rates increased with passaging of DPRV in suckling mice. Moreover, 421 serum samples were collected from individuals who lived near the bat collection site and had fever symptoms within 1 year. DPRV-specific antibodies were detected in 20 (4.75%) human serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Furthermore, 10 (2.38%) serum samples were DPRV positive according to plaque reduction neutralization assay, which revealed potential transmission of DPRV from bats to humans and highlighted the potential public health risk. Potential vector association with DPRV was not found with negative viral RNA in bloodsucking arthropods.IMPORTANCE We identified a novel rhabdovirus from the horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus thomasi) in China with probable infectivity in humans. DPRV was isolated in vitro from several mammalian cell lines, indicating wide host tropism, excluding bats, of DPRV. DPRV replicated in the brains of suckling mice, and the death rate of suckling mice increased with passaging of DPRV in vivo. Serological tests indicated the possible infectivity of DPRV in humans and the potential transmission to humans. The present findings provide preliminary evidence for the potential risk of DPRV to public health. Additional studies with active surveillance are needed to address interspecies transmission and determine the pathogenicity of DPRV in humans.																					WOS:000766860400010	35164557

The Human Nose Organoid Respiratory Virus Model: an Ex Vivo Human Challenge Model To Study Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Pathogenesis and Evaluate Therapeutics								MBIO				13	1					e0351					JAN-FEB 2022	2022	There is an unmet need for preclinical models to understand the pathogenesis of human respiratory viruses and predict responsiveness to immunotherapies. Airway organoids can serve as an ex vivo human airway model to study respiratory viral pathogenesis; however, they rely on invasive techniques to obtain patient samples. Here, we report a noninvasive technique to generate human nose organoids (HNOs) as an alternative to biopsy-derived organoids. We made air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures from HNOs and assessed infection with two major human respiratory viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Infected HNO-ALI cultures recapitulate aspects of RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection, including viral shedding, ciliary damage, innate immune responses, and mucus hypersecretion. Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the HNO-ALI respiratory virus model system to test the efficacy of palivizumab to prevent RSV infection. Palivizumab was administered in the basolateral compartment (circulation), while viral infection occurred in the apical ciliated cells (airways), simulating the events in infants. In our model, palivizumab effectively prevented RSV infection in a concentration dependent manner. Thus, the HNO-ALI model can serve as an alternative to lung organoids to study respiratory viruses and test therapeutics. IMPORTANCE Preclinical models that recapitulate aspects of human airway disease are essential for the advancement of novel therapeutics and vaccines. Here, we report a versatile airway organoid model, the human nose organoid (HNO), that recapitulates the complex interactions between the host and virus. HNOs are obtained using noninvasive procedures and show divergent responses to SARS-CoV-2 and RSV infection. SARS-CoV-2 induces severe damage to cilia and the epithelium, no interferon -l response, and minimal mucus secretion. In striking contrast, RSV induces hypersecretion of mucus and a profound interferon -l response with ciliary damage. We also demonstrated the usefulness of our ex vivo HNO model of RSV infection to test the efficacy of palivizumab, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody to prevent severe RSV disease in high-risk infants. Our study reports a breakthrough in both the development of a novel nose organoid model and in our understanding of the host cellular response to RSV and SARS-CoV-2 infection.

With so many variants discovered the CDC and WHO created its own classification system for SARS-CoV-2 variants, dividing them into variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs). Convalescent plasma, antiviral medicines, dexamethasone, monoclonal antibodies, and immuno modulators, which are currently available to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, could help manage SARS-CoV-2 infection, although their effectiveness is limited. COVID-19 vaccines have been created in a variety of techniques, all of which are briefly discussed in this article. The development of affordable and effective oral anti-COVID-19 drugs along with increased vaccination uptake, will go a long way toward not just reducing COVID-19's progression but also bringing hope for the end of this devastating pandemic caused by Covid 19.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infection in paediatrics. While antivirals are apparent candidates to treat RSV-induced diseases, they have not yet met expectations and have remained in infancy. There is growing evidence to suggest that modulating the exacerbated inflammation during RSV infection can improve disease outcome.Hypothesis. Curcumin-loaded niosomes have anti-inflammatory effects against RSV-induced respiratory disease by reducing immune cells' infiltration and inflammatory cytokines' production.Aim. This study evaluated the effects of curcumin-loaded niosomes on RSV-induced immunopathology in a mice model.Methodologies. Curcumin-loaded niosomes were prepared using the thin-film hydration method and characterized in vitro. Female Balb/c mice were infected by RSV-A2 and treated daily with curcumin-loaded niosomes. The potential anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin-loaded niosomes were evaluated on day 5 after infection.Results. Using curcumin-loaded niosomes decreased immune cell influx and the inflammatory mediators (MIP-1 alpha, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) production in the lung, resulting in alleviated lung pathology following RSV infection.Conclusion. These findings indicate that curcumin-loaded niosomes have anti-inflammatory potential and could be a promising candidate to alleviate RSV-associated immunopathology.

In December 2019, a new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) characterized by severe respiratory symptoms was discovered. The causative pathogen was a novel coronavirus known as 2019-nCoV and later as SARS-CoV-2. Within two months of its discovery, COVID-19 became a pandemic causing widespread morbidity and mortality. Methodology: Whole genome sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from Nigerian COVID-19 cases were retrieved by downloading from GISAID database. A total of 18 sequences that satisfied quality assurance (length >= 29,700 nts and number of unknown bases denoted as "N " <= 5%) were used for the study. In addition, genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 obtained from Nigeria's COVID-19 index case (Accession ID: EPI_ISL_413550) and the reference genome (Accession NC_ 045512.2) were obtained from GISAID and the GenBank databases, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was done in MAFFT (Version 7.471) while SNP calling was implemented in DnaSP (Version 6.12.03), respectively and then visualized in Jalview (Version 2.11.1.0). Phylogenetic analysis was with MEGA X software. Results: Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 had 99.9% genomic similarity with four large conserved genomic regions. A total of 66 SNPs were identified out of which 31 were informative. Nucleotide diversity assessment gave Pi = 0.00048 and average SNP frequency of 2.22 SNPs per 1000 nts. Non-coding genomic regions particularly 50UTR and 30UTR had a SNP density of 3.77 and 35.4, respectively. The region with the highest SNP density was ORF10 with a frequency of 8.55 SNPs/1000 nts). This value was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than that of the spike gene, the region of greatest interest in SARS-CoV-2 genomics. Majority (72.2%) of viruses in Nigeria are of L lineage with preponderance of D614G mutation which accounted for 11 (61.1%) out of the 18 viral sequences. Nigeria SARS-CoV-2 revealed 3 major clades namely Oyo, Ekiti and Osun on a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree. Conclusion and Recommendation: There was a preponderance of L lineage (to include the new lineage scheme) and D614G mutants. Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 genome revealed ORF1ab as the region containing the highest SNP density as compared to the spike gene. The implication of this distribution of SNPs for the empirical lower infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in Nigeria is discussed. This also underscores the need for more aggressive testing and treatment of COVID-19 in Nigeria. Additionally, attempt to produce testing kits for COVID-19 in Nigeria should consider the conserved regions identified in this study. Strict adherence to COVID-19 preventive measure is recommended in view of Nigerian SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic clustering pattern, which suggests intensive community transmission possibly rooted in communal culture characteristic of many ethnicities in Nigeria.(c) 2022 The Authors.

Virtual screening by targeting proteolytic sites of furin and TMPRSS2 to propose potential compounds obstructing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 virus into human host cells								JOURNAL OF TRADITIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE				12	1			6	15		10.1016/j.jtcme.2021.04.001				JAN 2022	2022	Background and aim: The year 2020 begins with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that cause the disease COVID-19, and continue till today. As of March 23, 2021, the outbreak has infected 124,313,054 worldwide with a total death of 2,735,707. The use of traditional medicines as an adjuvant therapy with western drugs can lower the fatality rate due to the COVID-19. Therefore, in silico molecular docking study was performed to search potential phytochemicals and drugs that can block the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells by inhibiting the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Experimental procedure: The protein-protein docking of the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2 was carried out with the virus spike (S) protein to examine the conformational details and residues involved in the complex formation. Subsequently, a library of 163 ligands containing phytochemicals and drugs was virtually screened to propose potential hits that can inhibit the proteolytic cleavage activity of furin and TMPRSS2. Results and conclusion: The phytochemicals like limonin, gedunin, eribulin, pedunculagin, limonin glycoside and betunilic acid bind at the active site of both furin and TMPRSS2. Limonin and gedunin found mainly in the citrus fruits and neem showed the highest binding energy at the active site of furin and TMPRSS2, respectively. The polyphenols found in green tea can also be useful in suppressing the furin activity. Among the drugs, the drug nafamostat may be more beneficial than the camostat in suppressing the activity of TMPRSS2. (c) 2021 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University.

J	Zelka, Fatmanur Zehra; Kocaturk, Rumeysa Rabia; Ozcan, Oznur Ozge; Karahan, Mesut								Can Nutritional Supports Beneficial in Other Viral Diseases Be Favorable for COVID-19?								KOREAN JOURNAL OF FAMILY MEDICINE				43	1			3	15		10.4082/kjfm.20.0134				JAN 2022	2022	The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2), has rapidly spread worldwide, causing many deaths, the number of which continues to increase. Global public health organizations and governments have advised on the adoption of various handwashing and hygiene guidelines, use of masks, and social distancing, along with isolation or lockdown protocols to prevent SARS-COV-2 spread. There are vaccines and drugs that are confirmed but still many human suffer from this disease. Important risk factors for SARS-COV-2 infection are similar to other viral infectious diseases as including influenza, hepatitis B, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and other lung infections. These diseases might be related to poor nutritional support, affecting the patient outcomes against COVID-19. In this review, we discuss some of the nutritional therapies currently being investigated for infectious diseases. Studies have shown that nutrition has the potential to prevent and mitigate viral infections. Micronutrients (vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D, and E, B9, and trace elements, such as iron, zinc, copper, selenium, magnesium, and polyphenols) and macronutrients (carbohydrates, prebiotics, probiotics, protein [amino acids], and lipids [fatty acids]) affect the whole body, including the immune system, preventing viral entry and modulating clinical symptoms. This review discusses the importance of nutrition as a strategy to understand food groups and key nutrients that may affect the clinical outcomes of COVID-19 patients during the ongoing pandemic. Scientists believe that the likelihood of another pandemic is imminent. COVID-19 remains important and scientists believe it will continue will in the future. We emphasize the lack of studies on the nutritional impact of COVID-19 in terms of nutrition, even though nutritional interventions has been shown to have many advantages during the treatment of viral infections.

Whether this impact can be extrapolated to kidney transplantation (KT) remains largely unknown. Methods We measured plasma HPgV-1 RNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting the 5 ' untranslated region at various points (pretransplantation, day 7, months 1, 3, 6, and 12) in 199 KT recipients. Study outcomes included posttransplant serious infection, immunosuppression-related adverse event (opportunistic infection and/or de novo cancer), and acute graft rejection. Results HPgV-1 infection was demonstrated in 52 (26.1%) patients, with rates increasing from 14.7% at baseline to 19.1% by month 12 (p-value = .071). De novo infection occurred in 13.8% of patients with no detectable HPgV-1 RNA before transplantation. Double-organ (liver-kidney or kidney-pancreas) transplantation (odds ratio [OR]: 5.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52-20.82) and donation after brain death (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.00-4.88) were associated with posttransplant HPgV-1 infection, whereas pretransplant hypertension was protective (OR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.09-0.55). There were no significant differences in the incidence of study outcomes according to HPgV-1 status. Plasma HPgV-1 RNA levels at different points did not significantly differ between patients that subsequently developed outcomes and those remaining free from these events. No correlation between HPgV-1 RNA and immune parameters or torque teno virus DNA load was observed either. Conclusion Unlike patients living with HIV, HPgV-1 infection does not seem to influence patient or graft outcomes after KT.																					WOS:000735901300001	34921747

Exosomes originating from infection with the cytoplasmic single-stranded RNA virus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) protect recipient cells by inducing RIG-I mediated IFN-B response that leads to activation of autophagy								CELL AND BIOSCIENCE				11	1					220	10.1186/s13578-021-00732-z				DEC 25 2021	2021	Background Although multiple studies have demonstrated a role for exosomes during virus infections, our understanding of the mechanisms by which exosome exchange regulates immune response during viral infections and affects viral pathogenesis is still in its infancy. In particular, very little is known for cytoplasmic single-stranded RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). We have used RVFV infection as a model for cytoplasmic single-stranded RNA viruses to address this gap in knowledge. RVFV is a highly pathogenic agent that causes RVF, a zoonotic disease for which no effective therapeutic or approved human vaccine exist. Results We show here that exosomes released from cells infected with RVFV (designated as EXi-RVFV) serve a protective role for the host and provide a mechanistic model for these effects. Our results show that treatment of both naive immune cells (U937 monocytes) and naive non-immune cells (HSAECs) with EXi-RVFV induces a strong RIG-I dependent activation of IFN-B. We also demonstrate that this strong anti-viral response leads to activation of autophagy in treated cells and correlates with resistance to subsequent viral infection. Since we have shown that viral RNA genome is associated with EXi-RVFV, RIG-I activation might be mediated by the presence of packaged viral RNA sequences. Conclusions Using RVFV infection as a model for cytoplasmic single-stranded RNA viruses, our results show a novel mechanism of host protection by exosomes released from infected cells (EXi) whereby the EXi activate RIG-I to induce IFN-dependent activation of autophagy in naive recipient cells including monocytes. Because monocytes serve as reservoirs for RVFV replication, this EXi-RVFV-induced activation of autophagy in monocytes may work to slow down or halt viral dissemination in the infected organism. These findings offer novel mechanistic insights that may aid in future development of effective vaccines or therapeutics, and that may be applicable for a better molecular understanding of how exosome release regulates innate immune response to other cytoplasmic single-stranded RNA viruses.

Evaluation of reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					24234	10.1038/s41598-021-03623-y				DEC 20 2021	2021	The main strategy for response and control of COVID-19 demands the use of rapid, accurate diagnostic tests aimed at the first point of health care. During the emergency, an increase in asymptomatic and symptomatic cases results in a great demand for molecular tests, which is promoting the development and application of rapid diagnostic technologies. In this study, we describe the development and evaluation of RT-LAMP to detect SARS-CoV-2 based on three genes (ORF1ab, M and N genes) in monoplex and triplex format. RT-LAMP assays were compared with the gold standard method RT-qPCR. The triplex format (RdRp, M and N genes) allowed obtaining comparable results with de RT-qPCR (RdRp and E genes), presented a sensitivity of 98.9% and a specificity of 97.9%, opening the opportunity to apply this method to detect SARS-CoV-2 at primary health-care centers.

The RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2, which is highly infectious and prone to rapid mutation, encodes both structural and nonstructural proteins. Vaccination is currently the only effective method to prevent COVID-19, and structural proteins are critical targets for vaccine development. Currently, many vaccines are in clinical trials or are already on the market. This review highlights ongoing advances in the design of prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines against COVID-19, including viral vector vaccines, DNA vaccines, RNA vaccines, live-attenuated vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines and bionic nanoparticle vaccines. In addition to traditional inactivated virus vaccines, some novel vaccines based on viral vectors, nanoscience and synthetic biology also play important roles in combating COVID-19. However, many challenges persist in ongoing clinical trials.																					WOS:000730547700001	34911569

COVID-19 and gut immunomodulation								WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY				27	46			7925	7942		10.3748/wjg.v27.i46.7925				DEC 14 2021	2021	The disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe respiratory illness that has emerged as a devastating health problem worldwide. The disease outcome is heterogeneous, and severity is likely dependent on the immunity of infected individuals and comorbidities. Although symptoms of the disease are primarily associated with respiratory problems, additional infection or failure of other vital organs are being reported. Emerging reports suggest a quite common co-existence of gastrointestinal (GI) tract symptoms in addition to respiratory symptoms in many COVID-19 patients, and some patients show just the GI symptoms. The possible cause of the GI symptoms could be due to direct infection of the epithelial cells of the gut, which is supported by the fact that (1) The intestinal epithelium expresses a high level of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 and transmembrane protease serine 2 protein that are required for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) entry into the cells; (2) About half of the severe COVID-19 patients show viral RNA in their feces and various parts of the GI tract; and (3) SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect gut epithelial cells in vitro (gut epithelial cells and organoids) and in vivo (rhesus monkey). The GI tract seems to be a site of active innate and adaptive immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 as clinically, stool samples of COVID-19 patients possess proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin 8), calprotectin (neutrophils activity), and immunoglobulin A antibodies. In addition to direct immune activation by the virus, impairment of GI epithelium integrity can evoke immune response under the influence of systemic cytokines, hypoxia, and changes in gut microbiota (dysbiosis) due to infection of the respiratory system, which is confirmed by the observation that not all of the GI symptomatic patients are viral RNA positive. This review comprehensively summarizes the possible GI immunomodulation by SARS-CoV-2 that could lead to GI symptoms, their association with disease severity, and potential therapeutic interventions.

Chimeric Fusion (F) and Attachment (G) Glycoprotein Antigen Delivery by mRNA as a Candidate Nipah Vaccine								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				12						772864	10.3389/fimmu.2021.772864				DEC 8 2021	2021	Nipah virus (NiV) represents a significant pandemic threat with zoonotic transmission from bats-to-humans with almost annual regional outbreaks characterized by documented human-to-human transmission and high fatality rates. Currently, no vaccine against NiV has been approved. Structure-based design and protein engineering principles were applied to stabilize the fusion (F) protein in its prefusion trimeric conformation (pre-F) to improve expression and increase immunogenicity. We covalently linked the stabilized pre-F through trimerization domains at the C-terminus to three attachment protein (G) monomers, forming a chimeric design. These studies detailed here focus on mRNA delivery of NiV immunogens in mice, assessment of mRNA immunogen-specific design elements and their effects on humoral and cellular immunogenicity. The pre-F/G chimera elicited a strong neutralizing antibody response and a superior NiV-specific Tfh and other effector T cell response compared to G alone across both the mRNA and protein platforms. These findings enabled final candidate selection of pre-F/G Fd for clinical development.																					WOS:000732727500001	34956199

SARS-CoV-2 binds to the host cell's angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor through the viral surface spike glycoprotein (S-protein). ACE2 is expressed in the oral mucosa and can therefore constitute an essential route for entry of SARS-CoV-2 into hosts through the tongue and lung epithelial cells. At present, no effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2 are yet in place. Blocking entry of the virus by inhibiting ACE2 is more advantageous than inhibiting the subsequent stages of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle. Based on current published evidence, we have summarized the different in silico based studies and repurposing of anti-viral drugs to target ACE2, SARS-CoV-2 S-Protein: ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD: ACE2. This review will be useful to researchers looking to effectively recognize and deal with SARS-CoV-2, and in the development of repurposed ACE2 inhibitors against COVID-19.

Serum Neutralization Profiles of Straw-Colored Fruit Bats (Eidolon helvum) in Makurdi (Nigeria), against Four Lineages of Lagos Bat Lyssavirus								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	12					2378	10.3390/v13122378				DEC 2021	2021	Lagos bat lyssavirus (LBV) comprising four lineages (A, B, C and D) can potentially cause the fatal disease rabies. Although LBV-B was initially isolated in Nigeria in 1956, there is no information on LBV lineages circulating in Nigeria. This study was undertaken for the first time to measure the neutralizing antibodies against four lineages of LBVs in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Makurdi, Nigeria. Serum samples (n = 180) collected during two periods (November 2017-March 2018 and November 2018-March 2019) from terminally bled bats captured for human consumption were tested using a modified fluorescent antibody virus neutralization (mFAVN) assay. A high proportion of bat sera (74%) neutralized at least one lineage of LBV (with reciprocal titers from 9 to >420.89) and most of them neutralized LBV-A (63%), followed by LBV-D (49%), LBV-C (45%) and LBV-B (24%). The majority of positive sera (75%, n = 100) neutralized multiple LBV lineages while the remaining 25% (n = 33) neutralized only a single lineage, i.e., LBV-A (n = 23), LBV-D (n = 8) and LBV-C (n = 2). None exclusively neutralized LBV-B. The results suggest that exposure to LBV is common in E. helvum and that LBV-A (but not LBV-B) is likely to be circulating in this region of Nigeria.

Pteropus bats are identified as a reservoir of henipaviruses and the source of transmission of the infection to humans over the past 20 years. A better understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms allowing bats to control viral infections requires the development of relevant, stable, and permissive cellular experimental models. By applying a somatic reprogramming protocol to Pteropus bat primary cells, using a combination of ESRRB (Estrogen Related Receptor Beta), CDX2 (Caudal type Homeobox 2), and c-MYC (MYC proto-oncogene) transcription factors, we generated bat reprogrammed cells. These cells exhibit stem cell-like characteristics and neural stem cell molecular signature. In contrast to primary fibroblastic cells, these reprogrammed stem cells are highly permissive to henipaviruses and exhibit specific transcriptomic profiles with the particular expression of certain susceptibility factors such as interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), which may be related to viral infection. These Pteropus bat reprogrammed stem cells should represent an important experimental tool to decipher interactions during henipaviruses infection in Pteropus bats, facilitate isolation and production of bat-borne viruses, and to better understand the bat biology.

Infection of Glia by Human Pegivirus Suppresses Peroxisomal and Antiviral Signaling Pathways								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				95	23					e01074-21	10.1128/JVI.01074-21				DEC 2021	2021	Human pegivirus (HPgV) infects peripheral leukocytes but was recently shown to be a neurotropic virus associated with leukoencephalitis in humans. In the present study, we investigated the neural cell tropism of HPgV as well as its effects on host immune responses. HPgV wild type (WT) and a mutant virus with a deletion in the HPgV NS2 gene (Delta NS2) were able to productively infect human astrocytes and microglia but not neurons or an oligodendrocyte-derived cell line. Of note, the Delta NS2 virus replicated better than WT pegivirus in astrocytes, with both viruses being able to subsequently infect and spread in fresh human astrocyte cultures. Infection of human glia by HPgV WT and Delta NS2 viruses resulted in suppression of peroxisome-associated genes, including PEX11B, ABCD1, PEX7, ABCD3, PEX3, and PEX5L, during peak viral production, which was accompanied by reduced expression of IFNB, IRF3, IRF1, and MAVS, particularly in Delta NS2-infected cells. These data were consistent with analyses of brain tissue from patients infected with HPgV in which we observed suppression of peroxisome and type I interferon gene transcripts, including PEX11B, ABCD3, IRF1, and IRF3, with concurrent loss of PMP70 immunoreactivity in glia. Our data indicate that human astrocytes and microglia are permissive to HPgV infection, resulting in peroxisome injury and suppressed antiviral signaling that is influenced by viral diversity.IMPORTANCE Human pegiviruses are detected in 1 to 5% of the general population, principally infecting leukocytes, although their effects on human health remain uncertain. Here, we show that human pegivirus infects specific neural cell types in culture and human brain and, like other neurotropic flaviviruses, causes suppression of peroxisome and antiviral signaling pathways, which could favor ongoing viral infection and perhaps confer susceptibility to the development of neurological disease.

Among the 6101 mosquitoes tested in 722 pools of up to 12 specimens, one pool of 10 Culex pipiens complex mosquitoes collected in early March 2021 in the cellar of a medieval castle in Rosslau, federal state of Saxony-Anhalt, tested positive. Subsequent mosquito DNA analysis produced Culex pipiens biotype pipiens. The pool homogenate remaining after nucleic acid extraction failed to grow the virus on Vero and C6/36 cells. Sequencing of the viral NS2B-NS3 coding region, however, demonstrated high homology with virus strains previously collected in Germany, e.g., from humans, birds, and mosquitoes, which have been designated the East German WNV clade. The finding confirms the expectation that WNV can overwinter in mosquitoes in Germany, facilitating an early start to the natural transmission season in the subsequent year. On the other hand, the calculated low infection prevalence of 0.016-0.20%, depending on whether one or twelve of the mosquitoes in the positive pool was/were infected, indicates a slow epidemic progress and mirrors the still-hypoendemic situation in Germany. In any case, local overwintering of the virus in mosquitoes suggests its long-term persistence and an enduring public health issue.																					WOS:000741512000001	34960732

Occurrence of Spike Antigen Specific SARS-CoV-2 Antibodies in Pre-Pandemic Samples of Domestic Cats Raises New Questions								BIOLOGY BULLETIN				48	SUPPL 2			S75	S81		10.1134/S1062359021150103			2	DEC 2021	2021	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Former studies showed the high similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to coronavirus (RaTG13) isolated from intermediate horseshoe bat and that the bats, ferrets, domestic cats were capable of transmitting the virus to contact conspecifics, which supports the virus circulation. We estimated the occurrence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in domestic cats after the outbreak in Moscow and corresponded it with earlier data. Among the domestic cats of Moscow sampled in 2020 10% were positive for IgG against RBD antigen of SARS-CoV-2, however, five cats (of 172; 2.9%) from Moscow 2018 were IgG-positive for RBD peptide of SARS CoV-2. There were no positive domestic cats sampled in the Russian Far East. The antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were not detected in archive human samples from Moscow. These results forced us to suggest either the exposure of cats to SARS-CoV-2 in Moscow in 2018 which is highly unlikely, or the effect of other viral peptides on the false-positive results. All in all, these proteins were found only in cats in one region of Russia and were not related to the feline coronavirus.																					WOS:000772063100007

We compared these responses to gene expression in PVM-infected mice treated with Lactobacillus plantarum, an immunobiotic agent that limits inflammation and averts the negative clinical sequelae typically observed in response to acute infection with this pathogen. Our findings revealed prominent differential expression of inflammation-associated genes as well as numerous genes and gene families implicated in mitosis and cell-cycle regulation, including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, cell division cycle genes, E2F transcription factors, kinesins, centromere proteins, and aurora kinases, among others. Of particular note was the differential expression of the cell division cycle gene Cdc20b, which was previously identified as critical for the ex vivo differentiation of multi-ciliated cells. Collectively, these findings provided us with substantial insight into post-viral repair processes and broadened our understanding of the mechanisms underlying Lactobacillus-mediated protection.

Although not yet identified, bats and rodents may be implicated in RVF virus (RVFV) epidemiology. In this study, we investigated the putative role of Egyptian frugivorous and insectivorous bats in RVFV epidemiology in Egypt.Methods: From 2019 to 2021, 200 bats of two different species from six Egyptian governorates were tested for phleboviruses using real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and sequence analysis.Results: Screening through rRT-PCR showed evidence of the RVFV genome only in insectivorous bats. Partial sequence and phylogenetic analysis based on S and M genome segments showed that these viruses are genetically similar to those circulating (clade A) in livestock and humans during previously reported RVFV outbreaks in 1977/78 and 2003 in Egypt.Conclusions: Our molecular data suggest that the bat Pipistrellus deserti could play a role in RVFV ecology in Egypt.

COVID-19 has emerged as a worldwide pandemic with a high number of fatalities. Approximately 112,654,202 people have been infected so far with this disease which has led to the death of more than one point seven million (2,496,749) till 24th Feb, 2021. Measures to counter this disease have led to a global economic slowdown. Multiple drug trials are ongoing and several putative candidates for vaccination against the virus have been approved and are in the pipeline. Many studies have also characterized the immunological profile of patients infected with COVID-19. Some studies suggest that the severity of the COVID-19 infection is directly associated with the cytokine storm. In this review, we aim to compile the available knowledge and describe the nature of immune responses in patients infected with COVID-19 infection in different age groups, comorbidity, and immune-compromised state and their association with disease severity.

Despite major efforts, no vaccine is available for RSV. A live attenuated vaccine is one of the most promising vaccine approaches for RSV. However, a major problem is that natural RSV infection does not induce long-lived protection. The reason likely lies in its NS1 and NS2 proteins' strong inhibition of type I interferon (IFN) induction, which impairs subsequent adaptive immunity. We found that RSV RNA contains N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and that recombinant RSVs lacking m(6)A methylation induce significantly higher type I IFN in cell culture and in mice compared to the parental RSV. Despite the fact that these m(6)A-deficient RSVs are significantly attenuated, they induce higher RSV-specific antibody and T cell immune responses in mice and provide complete protection against RSV challenge in cotton rats. Thus, m(6)A-deficient RSVs are more immunogenic than the parental RSV, highlighting that suppression of viral RNA m(6)A methylation is a novel strategy to enhance innate immunity which, in turn, enhances adaptive immunity.Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory tract infections in humans. A well-known challenge in the development of a live attenuated RSV vaccine is that interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral responses are strongly suppressed by RSV nonstructural proteins which, in turn, dampens the subsequent adaptive immune responses. Here, we discovered a novel strategy to enhance innate and adaptive immunity to RSV infection. Specifically, we found that recombinant RSVs deficient in viral RNA N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) and RSV grown in m(6)A methyltransferase (METTL3)-knockdown cells induce higher expression of RIG-I, bind more efficiently to RIG-I, and enhance RIG-I ubiquitination and IRF3 phosphorylation compared to wild-type virion RNA, leading to enhanced type I IFN production. Importantly, these m(6)A-deficient RSV mutants also induce a stronger IFN response in vivo, are significantly attenuated, induce higher neutralizing antibody and T cell immune responses in mice and provide complete protection against RSV challenge in cotton rats. Collectively, our results demonstrate that inhibition of RSV RNA m(6)A methylation enhances innate immune responses which in turn promote adaptive immunity.

Large-scale study on virological and serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in cats and dogs in Spain								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES											10.1111/tbed.14366		NOV 2021			2021	The disease produced by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently one of the primary concerns worldwide. Knowing the zoonotic origin of the disease and that several animal species, including dogs and cats, are susceptible to viral infection, it is critical to assess the relevance of pets in this pandemic. Here, we performed a large-scale study on SARS-CoV-2 serological and viral prevalence in cats and dogs in Spain in order to elucidate their role and susceptibility. Samples from animals in contact with COVID-19 positive people and/or compatible symptoms (n = 492), as well as from random animals (n = 1024), were taken. Despite the large number of animals analyzed, only 12 animals (eight dogs and four cats), which represents 0.79% of the total analyzed animals (n = 1516), were positive for viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in which viral isolation was possible in four animals. We detected neutralizing antibodies in 34 animals, four of them were also positive for PCR. This study evidences that pets are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection in natural conditions but at a low level, as evidenced by the low percentage of positive animals detected, being infected humans the main source of infection. However, the inclusion of animals in the surveillance of COVID-19 is still recommended.																					WOS:000719075300001	34724350

The development of preventive strategies for RSV has faced different challenges, including the legacy of the first vaccine attempt, and an incomplete understanding of the host immune response to the virus. However, promising preventive strategies against RSV are in the pipeline and their development has advanced rapidly in the past decade due in part to our improved knowledge about the structural conformation of key RSV proteins. These strategies include monoclonal antibodies and different vaccines platforms directed towards the main target populations.																					WOS:000719983900002	34781106

Areas covered This work reviews the current animal models for in vivo tests with SARS-CoV-2 as well as the challenges involved in the safety and efficacy trials. Expert opinion Studies have reported the use of nonhuman primates, ferrets, mice, Syrian hamsters, lagomorphs, mink, and zebrafish in experiments that aimed to understand the course of COVID-19 or test vaccines and other drugs. In contrast, the assays with animal hyperimmune sera have only been used in in vitro assays. Finding an animal that faithfully reproduces all the characteristics of the disease in humans is difficult. Some models may be more complex to work with, such as monkeys, or require genetic manipulation so that they can express the human ACE2 receptor, as in the case of mice. Although some models are more promising, possibly the use of more than one animal model represents the best scenario. Therefore, further studies are needed to establish an ideal animal model to help in the development of other treatment strategies besides vaccines.																					WOS:000714271500001	34727803

Exploring the Diversity of the Human Blood Virome								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	11					2322	10.3390/v13112322				NOV 2021	2021	Metagenomics is greatly improving our ability to discover new viruses, as well as their possible associations with disease. However, metagenomics has also changed our understanding of viruses in general. The vast expansion of currently known viral diversity has revealed a large fraction of non-pathogenic viruses, and offers a new perspective in which viruses function as important components of many ecosystems. In this vein, studies of the human blood virome are often motivated by the search for new viral diseases, especially those associated with blood transfusions. However, these studies have revealed the common presence of apparently non-pathogenic viruses in blood, particularly human anelloviruses and, to a lower extent, human pegiviruses (HPgV). To shed light on the diversity of the human blood virome, we subjected pooled plasma samples from 587 healthy donors in Spain to a viral enrichment protocol, followed by massive parallel sequencing. This showed that anelloviruses were clearly the major component of the blood virome and showed remarkable diversity. In total, we assembled 332 complete or near-complete anellovirus genomes, 50 of which could be considered new species. HPgV was much less frequent, but we, nevertheless, recovered 17 different isolates that we subsequently used for characterizing the diversity of this virus. In-depth investigation of the human blood virome should help to elucidate the ecology of these viruses, and to unveil potentially associated diseases.

Transplacental Antibody Transfer of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Specific IgG in Non-Human Primate Mother-Infant Pairs								PATHOGENS				10	11					1441	10.3390/pathogens10111441				NOV 2021	2021	One approach to protect new-borns against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is to vaccinate pregnant women in the last trimester of pregnancy. The boosting of circulating antibodies which can be transferred to the foetus would offer immune protection against the virus and ultimately the disease. Since non-human primates (NHPs) have similar reproductive anatomy, physiology, and antibody architecture and kinetics to humans, we utilized this preclinical species to evaluate maternal immunization (MI) using an RSV F subunit vaccine. Three species of NHPs known for their ability to be infected with human RSV in experimental challenge studies were tested for RSV-specific antibodies. African green monkeys had the highest overall antibody levels of the old-world monkeys evaluated and they gave birth to offspring with anti-RSV titers that were proportional to their mother. These higher overall antibody levels are associated with greater durability found in their offspring. Immunization of RSV seropositive AGMs during late pregnancy boosts RSV titers, which consequentially results in significantly higher titers in the vaccinated new-borns compared to the new-borns of unvaccinated mothers. These findings, accomplished in small treatment group sizes, demonstrate a model that provides an efficient, resource sparing and translatable preclinical in vivo system for evaluating vaccine candidates for maternal immunization.

Methodologies for Generating Brain Organoids to Model Viral Pathogenesis in the CNS								PATHOGENS				10	11					1510	10.3390/pathogens10111510				NOV 2021	2021	(1) Background: The human brain is of interest in viral research because it is often the target of viruses. Neurological infections can result in consequences in the CNS, which can result in death or lifelong sequelae. Organoids modeling the CNS are notable because they are derived from stem cells that differentiate into specific brain cells such as neural progenitors, neurons, astrocytes, and glial cells. Numerous protocols have been developed for the generation of CNS organoids, and our goal was to describe the various CNS organoid models available for viral pathogenesis research to serve as a guide to determine which protocol might be appropriate based on research goal, timeframe, and budget. (2) Methods: Articles for this review were found in Pubmed, Scopus and EMBASE. The search terms used were "brain + organoid " and "CNS + organoid " (3) Results: There are two main methods for organoid generation, and the length of time for organoid generation varied from 28 days to over 2 months. The costs for generating a population of organoids ranged from USD 1000 to 5000. (4) Conclusions: There are numerous methods for generating organoids representing multiple regions of the brain, with several types of modifications for fine-tuning the model to a researcher's specifications. Organoid models of the CNS can serve as a platform for characterization and mechanistic studies that can reduce or eliminate the use of animals, especially for viruses that only cause disease in the human CNS.

Detection of Antibodies to Lokern, Main Drain, St. Louis Encephalitis, and West Nile Viruses in Vertebrate Animals in Chihuahua, Guerrero, and Michoacan, Mexico								VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES											10.1089/vbz.2021.0028		OCT 2021			2021	We conducted serologic surveillance for flaviviruses and orthobunyaviruses in vertebrate animals in Mexico in 2018-2019. Sera were collected from 856 vertebrate animals, including 323 dogs, 223 horses, and 121 cows, from 16 species. The animals were from 3 states: Chihuahua in northwest Mexico (704 animals) and Guerrero and Michoacan on the Pacific Coast (27 and 125 animals, respectively). Sera were assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test using four flaviviruses (dengue type 2, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile, and Zika viruses) and six orthobunyaviruses from the Bunyamwera (BUN) serogroup (Cache Valley, Lokern, Main Drain, Northway, Potosi, and Tensaw viruses). Antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) were detected in 154 animals of 9 species, including 89 (39.9%) horses, 3 (21.4%) Indian peafowl, and 41 (12.7%) dogs. Antibodies to St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) were detected in seven animals, including three (0.9%) dogs. Antibodies to Lokern virus (LOKV) were detected in 22 animals: 19 (8.5%) horses, 2 (1.7%) cows, and a dog (0.3%). Antibodies to Main Drain virus (MDV) were detected in three (1.3%) horses. WNV and LOKV activity was detected in all three states, SLEV activity was detected in Chihuahua and Michoacan, and MDV activity was detected in Chihuahua. None of the animals was seropositive for Cache Valley virus, the most common and widely distributed BUN serogroup virus in North America. In conclusion, we provide serologic evidence that select flaviviruses and BUN serogroup viruses infect vertebrate animals in Chihuahua, Guerrero, and Michoacan. We also provide the first evidence of LOKV and MDV activity in Mexico.																					WOS:000707976200001	34652234

Each year a huge number of lives are lost as a result of these viral infections. Worldwide, MeV infection alone is responsible for over a hundred thousand deaths each year despite available vaccine. Therefore, there is an urgent need for treatment options to counteract these viral infections. The development of antiviral drugs in general stands as a huge challenge due to the rapid emergence of viral escape mutants. Here, we disclose the discovery of a small-molecule antiviral, compound 1 (ZHAWOC9045), active against several pneumo-/paramyxoviruses, including MeV, NiV, CDV, RSV, and parain-fluenza virus type 5 (PIV-5). A series of mechanistic characterizations revealed that compound 1 targets a host factor which is indispensable for viral genome replication. Drug resistance profiling against a paramyxovirus model (CDV) demonstrated no detectable adaptation despite prolonged time of investigation, thereby mitigating the rapid emergence of escape variants. Furthermore, a thorough structure-activity relationship analysis of compound 1 led to the invention of 100-times-more potent-derivatives, e.g., compound 2 (ZHAWOC21026). Collectively, we present in this study an attractive host-directed pneumoviral/paramyxoviral replication inhibitor with potential therapeutic application.IMPORTANCE Measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, canine distemper virus, and Nipah virus are some of the clinically significant RNA viruses that threaten substantial number of lives each year. Limited to no availability of treatment options for these viral infections makes it arduous to handle the outbreaks. This highlights the major importance of developing antivirals to fight not only ongoing infections but also potential future epidemics. Most of the discovered antivirals, in clinical trials currently, are virus targeted, which consequently poses the challenge of rapid emergence of escape variants. Here, we present compound 1 (ZHAWOC9045), discovered to target viral replication in a host-dependent manner, thereby exhibiting broad-spectrum activity against several members of the family Pneumo-/Paramyxoviridae.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine based on a propagation-defective RNA replicon elicited sterilizing immunity in mice								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				118	43					e2111075118	10.1073/pnas.2111075118j1of11				OCT 26 2021	2021	Self-amplifying RNA replicons are promising platforms for vaccine generation. Their defects in one or more essential functions for viral replication, particle assembly, or dissemination make them highly safe as vaccines. We previously showed that the deletion of the envelope (E) gene from the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) produces a replication-competent propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-Delta E). Evaluation of this replicon in mice expressing human dipeptidyl peptidase 4, the virus receptor, showed that the single deletion of the E gene generated an attenuated mutant. The combined deletion of the E gene with accessory open reading frames (ORFs) 3, 4a, 4b, and 5 resulted in a highly attenuated propagation-defective RNA replicon (MERS-CoV-Delta[3,4a,4b,5,E]). This RNA replicon induced sterilizing immunity in mice after challenge with a lethal dose of a virulent MERS-CoV, as no histopathological damage or infectious virus was detected in the lungs of challenged mice. The four mutants lacking the E gene were genetically stable, did not recombine with the E gene provided in trans during their passage in cell culture, and showed a propagation-defective phenotype in vivo. In addition, immunization with MERS-CoV-Delta[3,4a,4b,5,E] induced significant levels of neutralizing antibodies, indicating that MERS-CoV RNA replicons are highly safe and promising vaccine candidates.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING				9	6					106595	10.1016/j.jece.2021.106595		OCT 2021		DEC 2021	2021	The human coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 is now a global pandemic. Personal hygiene such as hand-washing, the use of personal protective equipment, and social distancing via local and national lockdowns are used to reduce the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns may have significant impacts on environmental quality and ergonomics. However, limited studies exists on the impacts of COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns on environmental quality and ergonomics in low-income settings. Therefore, the present study investigated the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on socioeconomics, ergonomics and environment (water quality, air quality and noise) in Uttarakhand, India. Approximately 55% of respondents experienced headaches, and the other common health-related issue was back pain, with 45% of respondents having problems with their backs. Water and air quality significantly improved during the lockdown relative to the pre-lockdown period, but was observed to return to their previous characteristics afterwards. Lockdowns significant increased the concentration of indoor air pollutants while noise pollution levels significantly declined. In summary, lockdowns have adverse impacts on ergonomics, resulting in work-related human health risks. The impacts of lockdowns on environmental quality are mixed: temporary improvements on water and air quality, and noise reduction were observed, but indoor air quality deteriorated. Therefore, during lockdowns there is a need to minimize the adverse environmental and ergonomic impacts of lockdowns while simultaneously enhancing the beneficial impacts.

Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) plays an important role in the detection of these viruses. Although these viruses are not mainly prevalent in China, occasionally imported cases have been reported with the increase in population mobility and entry-exit activities. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the ability of major domestic laboratories to detect and identify exotic arbovirus infections in travelers. Methods: An external quality assessment program for the molecular detection of EEEV, VEEV, WEEV, SLEV, WNV, YFV, TBEV, HeV and NiV was organized. The assessment panel included 26 negative and positive samples with different concentrations of virus-like particles and distributed to 31 laboratories to evaluate the accuracy of virus detection. Results: At the laboratory level, 87.5% (7/8, EEEV), 85.7% (12/14, WEEV), 100% (13/13, VEEV), 87.5% (7/8, HeV), 76.5% (13/17, NiV), 92.6% (25/27, YFV), 81.3% (13/16, WNV), 100% (5/5, SLEV) and 75.0% (6/8, TBEV) of the participants were considered "competent". Of all the results, the false-positive and false-negative rates were 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. The sensitivity of most detection assays (15/17, 88.2%) was more than 90%. In addition, we observed significantly different cycle threshold values when using primer-probe sets in different target regions to detect EEEV and SLEV. Conclusions: Most laboratories have reliable virus detection capabilities. However, laboratory testing capabilities need to be improved to avoid cross-contamination and to better manage undetected false-negative samples.																					WOS:000713274700004	34653568

In each phase, two camel herds were studied. These herds were located in Al-azraq and in Al-ramtha area and were named Al-azraq and Al-ramtha herds, respectively. The same camel herd of Al-zarqa area was sampled in both phases while two different camel herds, one in each phase, were sampled in Al-ramtha area. Blood and nasal swabs were collected from same selected animals in all visits to each herd in both phases. Additionally, nasal swabs and retropharyngeal lymph node tissue samples were collected from sixty-one camels slaughtered at Al-ramtha abattoir during phase 2 to enhance virus isolation opportunities and phylogenetic analysis. All sampled ani-mals from Al-azraq camel herd were either borderline or seropositive on spike 1 based ELISA assay and negative on quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in both phases. In Al-ramtha camel herds, an unsteady pattern prevailed in animals' seropositivity in both phases and viral RNA was detected in all animals in the end of phase 1 and in one animal during phase 2. For the seroconversion, anti-MERS-CoV spike 1 antibodies were detected in two animals in phase 1 in the first collection only. While, in phase 2, intermittent seroconversion pattern was observed in several samples over time of collections that ended with all animals became seropositive in the last collection (after nineteen days from viral RNA detection). In addition, viral RNA was detected in nasal swabs of 3 slaughtered camels. Phylogenetic analysis of a partial fragment of spike 1 gene sequences of all MERS-CoV isolates clustered together with clade B of MERS-CoV.

Excessive mucus secretion is one of the primary symbols in RSV related lower respiratory tract infections (RSV-related LRTI). However, the pathological processes of mucus hypersecretion in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells remains unclear. The current study explores the involvement of miR-34b/miR-34c in mucus hypersecretion in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells by targeting FGFR1. First, miR-34b/miR-34c and FGFR1 mRNA were quantified by qPCR in throat swab samples and cell lines, respectively. Then, the luciferase reporters' assay was designed to verify the direct binding between FGFR1 and miR-34b/miR-34c. Finally, the involvement of AP-1 signalling was assessed by western blot. This study identified that miR-34b/miR-34c was involved in c-Jun-regulated MUC5AC production by targeting FGFR1 in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells. These results provide some useful insights into the molecular mechanisms of mucus hypersecretion which may also bring new potential strategies to improve mucus hypersecretion in RSV disease.

Thus, the main objective of this study was to examine the usefulness of Nutritional status-2002 (NRS-2002) among COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Material and Methods In this cross-sectional study, 73 patients with definitive corona diagnosis admitted to the ICUs of Al-Zahra hospital, Isfahan, Iran in October 2020 to January 2021 were recruited. Dietary intake, NRS-2002, demographic, anthropometric and biochemical indices of patients were recorded. Results The majority of patients were at risk for moderate (69.9%) to severe (12.3%) malnutrition. Daily calorie intake (P = .001) and albumin (P = .001) levels in deceased patients were significantly lower than the recovered group. A direct correlation between NRS-2002 and age (P < .001) and an inverse correlation with daily calorie intake (P = .002), albumin (P = .05) and PaO2 (P = .034) was found. Moreover, there is a strong correlation between NRS-2002 score and chance of death among COVID-19 patients (OR=34.5, 95%CI:(5.2 - 228.93), P-value<0.001). Likewise, the levels of bilirubin direct (OR=8, 95%CI:(1.30 - 49.38), P-value=0.025) and creatine-phosphokinase (OR=0.9, 95%CI:(0.99 - 1.00), P-value=0.035) have a significant direct association with chance of death. Conclusion Results showed patients with COVID-19 admitted to the ICU did not have appropriate nutritional status and mortality was higher among patients with lower amounts of the serum albumin and daily calorie intakes. Furthermore, there is a strong association between the NRS-2002 index and the chance of mortality in these patients.																					WOS:000705550500001	34606153

Phylogenetic analysis of human pegivirus from anti-hepatitis C virus IgG-positive patients								INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION				96						105099	10.1016/j.meegid.2021.105099		OCT 2021		DEC 2021	2021	Human pegivirus type 1 (HPgV-1) is a non-pathogenic RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family that usually occurs as a co-infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), though some evidence suggests it may play a role in certain cancers. The present study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPgV-1 infection in Iraqi antiHCV IgG-positive patients, the risk factors associated with this infection, and the genotype of local isolates of this virus. A total of 88 anti-HCV IgG-positive patients participated in this cross-sectional study. Viral RAN was extracted from whole blood samples, and cDNA was produced using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR). Two pairs of primers were used in nested PCR to amplify the virus genome's 5 '-untranslated region (5'UTR). For direct sequencing, fourteen PCR products from the second round of PCR were chosen at random. A homology search was performed using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) program to identify the resultant sequencing. The phylogenetic tree of the local isolates and 31 reference isolates was constructed using MEGA X software to estimate the virus's genetic diversity and relatedness. Out of 88 patients included in this study, 27(30.68%) of patients were found to be positive for HPgV-1 RNA. The nucleotide homology between the 14 local isolates and the reference isolates. was found to be 87-97%. Phylogenetic analysis results in a tree with four main parts, which are distributed as follows: 10 local isolates are genotype 2; 2 are genotype 1; 1 is genotype 5, and 1 is genotype 6. We conclude that when compared to other countries, the infection rate of Iraqi anti-HCV IgG-positive patients with HPgV-1 is relatively high (30.68%). The most common HPgV-1 genotype in Iraq is genotype 2.																					WOS:000708680000006	34601095

Until now, its role has only been considered in studies on respiratory and salivary gland infections. The scant literature data, consisting mainly of papers from the last century, do not sufficiently address the topic of SDAV infections. The ongoing pandemic has demonstrated, once again, the role of the Coronaviridae family as extremely dangerous etiological agents of human zoonoses. The ability of coronaviruses to cross the species barrier and change to hosts commonly found in close proximity to humans highlights the need to characterize SDAV infections. The main host of the infection is the rat, as mentioned above. Rats inhabit large urban agglomerations, carrying a vast epidemic threat. Of the 2277 existing rodent species, 217 are reservoirs for 66 zoonotic diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. This review provides insight into the current state of knowledge of SDAV characteristics and its likely zoonotic potential.</p>																					WOS:000713027700001	34696425

Utilizing the VirIdAl Pipeline to Search for Viruses in the Metagenomic Data of Bat Samples								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	10					2006	10.3390/v13102006				OCT 2021	2021	According to various estimates, only a small percentage of existing viruses have been discovered, naturally much less being represented in the genomic databases. High-throughput sequencing technologies develop rapidly, empowering large-scale screening of various biological samples for the presence of pathogen-associated nucleotide sequences, but many organisms are yet to be attributed specific loci for identification. This problem particularly impedes viral screening, due to vast heterogeneity in viral genomes. In this paper, we present a new bioinformatic pipeline, VirIdAl, for detecting and identifying viral pathogens in sequencing data. We also demonstrate the utility of the new software by applying it to viral screening of the feces of bats collected in the Moscow region, which revealed a significant variety of viruses associated with bats, insects, plants, and protozoa. The presence of alpha and beta coronavirus reads, including the MERS-like bat virus, deserves a special mention, as it once again indicates that bats are indeed reservoirs for many viral pathogens. In addition, it was shown that alignment-based methods were unable to identify the taxon for a large proportion of reads, and we additionally applied other approaches, showing that they can further reveal the presence of viral agents in sequencing data. However, the incompleteness of viral databases remains a significant problem in the studies of viral diversity, and therefore necessitates the use of combined approaches, including those based on machine learning methods.

They are a small, genetically modifiable animal for which a large arsenal of genetic and immunologic tools is available for evaluation of pathogenesis and potential vaccines and therapeutics. SARS-CoV-2, the betacoronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, does not naturally replicate in wild-type mice, due to structural differences between human and mouse ACE2, the primary receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. However, several mouse strains have been developed that allow for SARS-CoV-2 replication and clinical disease. Two broad strategies have primarily been deployed for developing mouse strains susceptible to COVID-19-like disease: adding in the human ACE2 gene and adapting the virus to the mouse ACE2 receptor. Both approaches result in mice that develop several of the clinical and pathologic hallmarks of COVID-19, including acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute lung injury. In this review, we describe key acute pulmonary and extrapulmonary pathologic changes seen in COVID-19 patients that mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection ideally replicate, the essential development of mouse models for the study of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and the basis of many of the models of COVID-19, and key clinical and pathologic features of currently available mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Like all human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 originated in a wildlife reservoir, most likely from bats. As SARS-CoV-2 has spread across the globe in humans, it has spilled over to infect a variety of non-human animal species in domestic, farm, and zoo settings. Additionally, a broad range of species, including one neotropical monkey, have proven to be susceptible to experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Together, these findings raise the specter of establishment of novel enzootic cycles of SARS-CoV-2. To assess the potential exposure of free-living non-human primates to SARS-CoV-2, we sampled 60 neotropical monkeys living in proximity to Manaus and Sao Jose do Rio Preto, two hotspots for COVID-19 in Brazil. Our molecular and serological tests detected no evidence of SAR-CoV-2 infection among these populations. While this result is reassuring, sustained surveillance efforts of wildlife living in close association with human populations is warranted, given the stochastic nature of spillover events and the enormous implications of SARS-CoV-2 spillover for human health.

FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH				9						717941	10.3389/fpubh.2021.717941				SEP 30 2021	2021	Coronaviruses cause respiratory and digestive diseases in vertebrates. The recent pandemic, caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2, is taking a heavy toll on society and planetary health, and illustrates the threat emerging coronaviruses can pose to the well-being of humans and other animals. Coronaviruses are constantly evolving, crossing host species barriers, and expanding their host range. In the last few decades, several novel coronaviruses have emerged in humans and domestic animals. Novel coronaviruses have also been discovered in captive wildlife or wild populations, raising conservation concerns. The evolution and emergence of novel viruses is enabled by frequent cross-species transmission. It is thus crucial to determine emerging coronaviruses' potential for infecting different host species, and to identify the circumstances under which cross-species transmission occurs in order to mitigate the rate of disease emergence. Here, I review (broadly across several mammalian host species) up-to-date knowledge of host range and circumstances concerning reported cross-species transmission events of emerging coronaviruses in humans and common domestic mammals. All of these coronaviruses had similar host ranges, were closely related (indicative of rapid diversification and spread), and their emergence was likely associated with high-host-density environments facilitating multi-species interactions (e.g., shelters, farms, and markets) and the health or well-being of animals as end- and/or intermediate spillover hosts. Further research is needed to identify mechanisms of the cross-species transmission events that have ultimately led to a surge of emerging coronaviruses in multiple species in a relatively short period of time in a world undergoing rapid environmental change.</p>																					WOS:000707462500001	34660513

We correlated sensitivity data of SARS-CoV-2 rapid antigen tests (RATs) to viral RNA genome equivalents analyzed by real-time reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further, we checked their suitability for testing animals by assessing saliva and VOC effects. Viral loads up to 2 logs (RNA copy number) under the hypothetical SARS-CoV-2 infectivity threshold were detected by most analyzed RATs. However, while saliva from various animal species showed generally no adverse effects on the RATs' analytical sensitivities, the detection of VOCs B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 was in some RATs inferior to non-VOC viruses.

In addition, these new variants hindered the efforts of vaccines and other therapeutic developments. In this review article, we explained the emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, their transmission risk, mortality rate, and, more importantly, the impact of each new variant on the efficacy of the developed vaccines reported in different literature and findings. The literature reported that with the emergence of new variants, the efficacy of different vaccines is declined, hospitalization and the risk of reinfection is increased. The reports concluded that the emergence of a variant that entirely evades the immune response triggered by the vaccine is improbable. The emergence of new variants and reports of re-infections are creating a more distressing situation and therefore demands further investigation to formulate an effective therapeutic strategy.

We developed a mathematical metapopulation model describing RVF virus transmission in livestock across the four islands of the Comoros archipelago, accounting for island-specific environments and inter-island animal movements. By fitting our model in a Bayesian framework to 2004-2015 surveillance data, we estimated the importance of environmental drivers and animal movements on disease persistence, and tested the impact of different control scenarios on reducing disease burden throughout the archipelago. Here we report that (i) the archipelago network was able to sustain viral transmission in the absence of explicit disease introduction events after early 2007, (ii) repeated outbreaks during 2004-2020 may have gone under-detected by local surveillance, and (iii) co-ordinated within-island control measures are more effective than between-island animal movement restrictions.Rift Valley fever is a zoonotic haemorrhagic fever with complex transmission dynamics influenced by environmental variables and animal movements. Here, the authors develop a metapopulation model incorporating these factors and use it to identify the main drivers of transmission in the Comoros archipelago.

A human recombinant analogue to plasma-derived vaccinia immunoglobulin prophylactically and therapeutically protects against lethal orthopoxvirus challenge								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				195						105179	10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105179		SEP 2021		NOV 2021	2021	Orthopoxviruses such as variola and monkeypox viruses continue to threaten the human population. Monkeypox virus is endemic in central and western Africa and outbreaks have reached as far as the U.S. Although variola virus, the etiologic agent of smallpox, has been eradicated by a successful vaccination program, official and likely clandestine stocks of the virus exist. Moreover, studies with ectromelia virus (the etiological agent of mousepox) have revealed that IL-4 recombinant viruses are significantly more virulent than wild-type viruses even in mice treated with vaccines and/or antivirals. For these reasons, it is critical that antiviral modalities are developed to treat these viruses should outbreaks, or deliberate dissemination, occur. Currently, 2 antivirals (brincidofovir and tecovirimat) are in the U.S. stockpile allowing for emergency use of the drugs to treat smallpox. Both antivirals have advantages and disadvantages in a clinical and emergency setting. Here we report on the efficacy of a recombinant immunoglobulin (rVIG) that demonstrated efficacy against several orthopoxviruses in vitro and in vivo in both a prophylactic and therapeutic fashion. A single intraperitoneal injection of rVIG significantly protected mice when given up to 14 days before or as late as 6 days post challenge. Moreover, rVIG reduced morbidity, as measured by weight-change, as well as several previously established biomarkers of disease. In rVIG treated mice, we found that vDNA levels in blood were significantly reduced, as was ALT (a marker of liver damage) and infectious virus levels in the liver. No apparent adverse events were observed in rVIG treated mice, suggesting the immunoglobulin is well tolerated. These findings suggest that recombinant immunoglobulins could be candidates for further evaluation and possible licensure under the FDA Animal Rule.																					WOS:000702838600005	34530009

The cell membrane protein Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the initiation point for both the coronavirus infections in humans. Here, we model the molecular interactions and mechanical properties of ACE2 with both SARS-CoV and COVID-19 spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD). We report that the COVID-19 spike RBD interacts with ACE2 more strongly and at only two protein residues, as compared to multi-residue interaction of the SARSCoV. Although both coronaviruses stiffen the ACE2, the impact of COVID-19 is six times larger, which points towards differences in the severity of the reported respiratory distress. The recognition of specific residues of ACE2 attachments to coronaviruses is important as the residues suggest potential sites of intervention to inhibit attachment and subsequent entry of the COVID-19 into human host cells																					WOS:000709405400002	34511698

PDCoV was initially reported in Hong Kong (China) in 2012 and subsequently emerged in swine herds with diarrhea in Ohio (USA) in 2014. Since then, it has spread to Canada, South Korea, mainland China, and several Southeast Asian countries. Information about the epidemiology, evolution, prevention, and control of PDCoV and its prevalence in China has not been comprehensively reported, especially in the last five years. This review is an update of current information on the general characteristics, epidemiology, geographical distribution, and evolutionary relationships, and the status of PDCoV vaccine development, focusing on the prevalence of PDCoV in China and vaccine research in particular.

We describe the community engagement in containing a bovine paralytic rabies outbreak in two rural communities of Mexico. We carried out a participatory rapid appraisal using different community participation techniques for 2 weeks, including information sharing, community meetings, prioritization of activities, and training. In addition to the animal census and vaccination, necropsy and immunofluorescence tests were performed to diagnose rabies. Cattle mortality during the outbreak of bovine paralytic rabies was 4.5% (15/331); 1446 anti-rebies vacines were applied, directly benefiting 94 families. Members of two rural communities were trained. The continuous exchange of information among the stakeholders allowed us to inform, consult, involve, and empower community members. Community participation played an essential role in identifying a common problem, implementing activities to contain it, and successfully safeguarding public health, animal production, and food security.

Applied ecoimmunology: using immunological tools to improve conservation efforts in a changing world								CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY				9						coab074	10.1093/conphys/coab074		SEP 2021		SEP 7 2021	2021	Ecoimmunology is a rapidly developing field that explores how the environment shapes immune function, which in turn influences host-parasite relationships and disease outcomes. Host immune defence is a key fitness determinant because it underlies the capacity of animals to resist or tolerate potential infections. Importantly, immune function can be suppressed, depressed, reconfigured or stimulated by exposure to rapidly changing environmental drivers like temperature, pollutants and food availability. Thus, hosts may experience trade-offs resulting from altered investment in immune function under environmental stressors. As such, approaches in ecoimmunology can provide powerful tools to assist in the conservation of wildlife. Here, we provide case studies that explore the diverse ways that ecoimmunology can inform and advance conservation efforts, from understanding how Galapagos finches will fare with introduced parasites, to using methods from human oncology to design vaccines against a transmissible cancer in Tasmanian devils. In addition, we discuss the future of ecoimmunology and present 10 questions that can help guide this emerging field to better inform conservation decisions and biodiversity protection. From better linking changes in immune function to disease outcomes under different environmental conditions, to understanding how individual variation contributes to disease dynamics in wild populations, there is immense potential for ecoimmunology to inform the conservation of imperilled hosts in the face of new and re-emerging pathogens, in addition to improving the detection and management of emerging potential zoonoses.

The development of organoid technology has led to better recapitulation of the in vivo environment of organs, and can overcome the constraints of existing disease models. However, for more precise disease modeling, engineering approaches such as microfluidics and biomaterials, that aid in mimicking human physiology, need to be integrated with the organoid models. In this review, we introduce key elements for disease modeling and recent engineering advances using both liver and lung organoids. Due to the importance of personalized medicine, we also emphasize patient-derived cancer organoid models and their engineering approaches. These organoid-based disease models combined with microfluidics, biomaterials, and co-culture systems will provide a powerful research platform for understanding disease mechanisms and developing precision medicine; enabling preclinical drug screening and drug development.

In this review, we introduce liver, lung, and cancer organoids integrated with various engineering approaches as a novel platform for personalized disease modeling. These engineered organoid-based disease models will provide a powerful research platform for understanding disease mechanisms and developing precision medicine. (c) 2021 Acta Materialia Inc.

Studies of the pathway in mice have strongly shaped the view that mammalian piRNAs are essential for male but not for female fertility. Here, we report that the role of the piRNA pathway substantially differs in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), the piRNA pathway setup of which more closely resembles that of other mammals, including humans. The loss of the Mov10l1 RNA helicase-an essential piRNA biogenesis factor-leads to striking phenotypes in both sexes. In contrast to mice, female Mov10l1(-/-) hamsters are sterile because their oocytes do not sustain zygotic development. Furthermore, Mov10l1(-/-) male hamsters have impaired establishment of spermatogonia accompanied by transcriptome dysregulation and an expression surge of a young retrotransposon subfamily. Our results show that the mammalian piRNA pathway has essential roles in both sexes and its adaptive nature allows it to manage emerging genomic threats and acquire new critical roles in the germline.

Based on an expert survey, we examine key aspects that are likely to influence the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe. The challenges and developments will strongly depend on the progress of national and global vaccination programs, the emergence and spread of variants of concern (VOCs), and public responses to non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). In the short term, many people remain unvaccinated, VOCs continue to emerge and spread, and mobility and population mixing are expected to increase. Therefore, lifting restrictions too much and too early risk another damaging wave. This challenge remains despite the reduced opportunities for transmission given vaccination progress and reduced indoor mixing in summer 2021. In autumn 2021, increased indoor activity might accelerate the spread again, whilst a necessary reintroduction of NPIs might be too slow. The incidence may strongly rise again, possibly filling intensive care units, if vaccination levels are not high enough. A moderate, adaptive level of NPIs will thus remain necessary. These epidemiological aspects combined with economic, social, and health-related consequences provide a more holistic perspective on the future of the COVID-19 pandemic. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

Comparing these two threats allowed us to consider existing vulnerabilities and expected and uncertain consequences: infants born into disability, neurological symptoms across age groups, disease transmission pathways, national surveillance and control systems, and vaccine availability. We found that 1) human sexual ZIKV disease transmission, specifically the complexities of asymptomatic transmission and 2) verification that humans are the primary disease amplification reservoir are significant indicators of ZIKV threat severity. Novel public health messaging that describes disease transmission pathways in plain language must be developed to assure the health of all populations, not only those covered by protective legislation and defined as at-risk. Surveillance and mosquito control systems must be reestablished nationally and globally to enable a One Health approach to pandemic and global epidemic prevention and mitigation in a time of increasing climate change.

A prime example is the currently active severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV2, which presumably originated from bats, demonstrating that the risk of a new outbreak of bat coronavirus is always latent. Therefore, an in-depth investigation to better comprehend bat CoVs has become an important issue within the international community, a group that aims to attenuate the consequences of future outbreaks. In this review, we present a concise introduction to CoVs found in bats and discuss their distribution in Southeast Asia. We also discuss the unique adaptation features in bats that confer the ability to be a potential coronavirus reservoir. In addition, we review the bat coronavirus-linked diseases that have emerged in the last two decades. Finally, we propose key factors helpful in the prediction of a novel coronavirus outbreak and present the most recent methods used to forecast an evolving outbreak.

Drivers and Distribution of Henipavirus-Induced Syncytia: What Do We Know?								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	9					1755	10.3390/v13091755				SEP 2021	2021	Syncytium formation, i.e., cell-cell fusion resulting in the formation of multinucleated cells, is a hallmark of infection by paramyxoviruses and other pathogenic viruses. This natural mechanism has historically been a diagnostic marker for paramyxovirus infection in vivo and is now widely used for the study of virus-induced membrane fusion in vitro. However, the role of syncytium formation in within-host dissemination and pathogenicity of viruses remains poorly understood. The diversity of henipaviruses and their wide host range and tissue tropism make them particularly appropriate models with which to characterize the drivers of syncytium formation and the implications for virus fitness and pathogenicity. Based on the henipavirus literature, we summarized current knowledge on the mechanisms driving syncytium formation, mostly acquired from in vitro studies, and on the in vivo distribution of syncytia. While these data suggest that syncytium formation widely occurs across henipaviruses, hosts, and tissues, we identified important data gaps that undermined our understanding of the role of syncytium formation in virus pathogenesis. Based on these observations, we propose solutions of varying complexity to fill these data gaps, from better practices in data archiving and publication for in vivo studies, to experimental approaches in vitro.

COVID-19, the current global health emergency, is wreaking havoc on human health systems and, to a lesser degree, on animals globally. The outbreak has continued since the first report of COVID-19 in China in December 2019, and the second and third waves of the outbreak have already begun in several countries. COVID-19 is expected to have adverse effects on crop production, food security, integrated pest control, tourism, the car industry, and other sectors of the global economy. COVID-19 induces a range of effects in livestock that is reflected economically since human health and livelihood are intertwined with animal health. We summarize the potentially harmful effects of COVID-19 on livestock and possible mitigation steps in response to this global outbreak. Mitigation of the negative effects of COVID-19 and future pandemics on livestock requires the implementation of current guidelines.																					WOS:000703675600013	34840464

Because these viruses rely entirely on the host cellular machinery for survival, their evolution is likely to be guided by the link between the codon usage of the virus and that of its host. As a result, specific cellular microenvironments of the diverse hosts and/or host tissues imprint peculiar molecular signatures in virus genomes. Our study is aimed at deciphering some of these signatures. Using a variety of genetic methods we demonstrated that trends in codon usage across chiroptera-hosted CoVs are collaboratively driven by geographically different host-species and temporal-spatial distribution. We not only found that chiroptera-hosted CoVs are the ancestors of SARS-CoV-2, but we also revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has the codon usage characteristics similar to those seen in CoVs infecting the Rhinolophus sp. Surprisingly, the envelope gene of beta-CoVs infecting Rhinolophus sp., including SARS-CoV-2, had extremely high CpG levels, which appears to be an evolutionarily conserved trait. The dissection of the furin cleavage site of various CoVs infecting hosts revealed host-specific preferences for arginine codons; however, arginine is encoded by a wider variety of synonymous codons in the murine CoV (MHV-A59) furin cleavage site. Our findings also highlight the latent diversity of CoVs in mammals that has yet to be fully explored.																					WOS:000702087400001	34578428

Among micro-organisms, viruses form a separate taxon of organisms. Viruses are obligate parasites, being inactive without a host and becoming active once in contact with specific hosts. Viruses, with an inherent ability to infect and hijack cellular structures, have been utilised as vectors to introduce foreign genetic material in a variety of biological species, e.g. adenoviral vectors. However, viruses have also been the root cause of many infectious diseases, most notable being HIV-AIDS, for its resistance to treatment and omnipresent occurrence. There are many families of viruses like retroviridae, picornaviridae and poxviridae. This review focuses on a specific member of the coronaviridae, the SARS-CoV-2. This virus is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarises its transmission, molecular mechanism by which it causes disease, associated clinical symptoms and the strategies available to control it from sources like PubMed, Google Scholar, webservers of National Institute of Health (NIH), European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), World Health Organisation (WHO), United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) available as on 1st May 2021.

Nevertheless, viruses have evolved different strategies to evade innate immune control. In this review, we describe recent findings delineating the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and type I IFN response in vitro and in vivo and report current studies using IFN-based therapy for COVID-19 treatment. Among the many activities attributed to the type I interferon (IFN) multigene family, their roles as mediators of the antiviral immune response have emerged as important components of the host response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Viruses likewise have evolved multiple immune evasion strategies to circumvent the host immune response and promote virus propagation and dissemination. Therefore, a thorough characterization of host-virus interactions is essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we summarize the virus-mediated evasion of the IFN responses and the viral functions involved, the genetic basis of IFN production in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the progress of clinical trials designed to utilize type I IFN as a potential therapeutic tool.

RVF virus (RVFV) is transmitted by mosquito vectors to ruminants, causing epizootics, and then from animals to humans, triggering epidemics. During its cycle, RVFV infects a wide range of hosts, but the associated pathogenesis has yet to be elucidated. RVFV displays a predominant hepatic tropism, but also has a multicellular tropism inducing physiopathological effects in several tissues. However, there is variability between species in terms of physiopathology : a common clinical picture is found (severe hepatitis, hemorrhages, leukopenia), but certain forms are mainly found in humans (neurological and ocular damage) or in ruminant herds (waves of abortions). Although the molecular mechanisms involved are still poorly understood, it seems that early inflammatory response is related to the severity of the pathology. A better understanding of the pathogenesis of RVFV seems essential, especially since no specific treatment exists to date.																					WOS:000718307400004	34762049

The virus can infect different animal species under experimental conditions, and mink on fur farms in Europe and other areas are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We investigated SARS-CoV-2 infection in 91 mink from a farm in northern Poland. Using reverse transcription PCR, antigen detection, and next-generation sequencing, we confirmed that 15 animals were positive for SARS-CoV-2. We verified this finding by sequencing full viral genomes and confirmed a virus variant that has sporadic mutations through the full genome sequence in the spike protein (G75V and C1247F). We were unable to find other SARS-CoV-2 sequences simultaneously containing these 2 mutations. Country-scale monitoring by veterinary inspection should be implemented to detect SARS-CoV-2 in other mink farms.																					WOS:000699711800010	34423763

Pirahy virus: Identification of a new and potential emerging arbovirus in South Brazil								VIRUS EVOLUTION				7	2						10.1093/ve/veab105				SEP 1 2021	2021	Genomic and epidemiological surveillance are paramount for the discovery of new viruses with the potential to cross species barriers. Here, we present a new member of the genus Alphavirus found in Trichoprosopon and Wyeomia mosquitoes, tentatively named Pirahy virus (PIRAV). PIRAV was isolated from mosquito pools collected in a rural area of Pirai do Sul, South Brazil. In vitro assays revealed that PIRAV replicates and causes cytopathic effects in vertebrate cell lines such as Vero E6, SH-SY5Y, BHK-21 and UMNSAH/DF-1. Genomic signature analysis supports these results showing a dinucleotide and codon usage balance compatible with several hosts. Phylogenetic analyses placed PIRAV basal to the Venezuelan equine encephalitis complex. Genome analyses, electron microscopy, and biological characterization show findings that may alert for the emergence of a new arbovirus in South America.

However, understanding how bats can harbor several microorganisms without developing illnesses is still a matter under discussion. Viruses and other pathogens are often studied as stand-alone entities, despite that, in nature, they mostly live in multispecies associations called biofilms-both externally and within the host. Microorganisms in biofilms are enclosed by an extracellular matrix that confers protection and improves survival. Previous studies have shown that viruses can secondarily colonize preexisting biofilms, and viral biofilms have also been described. In this review, we raise the perspective that CoVs can persistently infect bats due to their association with biofilm structures. This phenomenon potentially provides an optimal environment for nonpathogenic and well-adapted viruses to interact with the host, as well as for viral recombination. Biofilms can also enhance virion viability in extracellular environments, such as on fomites and in aquatic sediments, allowing viral persistence and dissemination. Moreover, understanding the biofilm lifestyle of CoVs in reservoirs might contribute to explaining several burning questions as to persistence and transmissibility of highly pathogenic emerging CoVs.

We isolated a panel of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from the B cells of an individual with prior exposure to equine Hendra virus (HeV) vaccine, targeting distinct antigenic sites. The most potent class of cross-reactive antibodies achieves neutralization by blocking viral attachment to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3, with a second class being enhanced by receptor binding. mAbs from both classes display synergistic activity in vitro. In a stringent hamster model of NiV Bangladesh (NiVB) infection, antibodies from both classes reduce morbidity and mortality and achieve synergistic protection in combination. These candidate mAbs might be suitable for use in a cocktail therapeutic approach to achieve synergistic potency and reduce the risk of virus escape.

Taking flight: An ecological, evolutionary and genomic perspective on bat telomeres								MOLECULAR ECOLOGY											10.1111/mec.16117		AUG 2021			2021	Over 20% of all living mammals are bats (order Chiroptera). Bats possess extraordinary adaptations including powered flight, laryngeal echolocation and a unique immune system that enables them to tolerate a diversity of viral infections without presenting clinical disease symptoms. They occupy multiple trophic niches and environments globally. Significant physiological and ecological diversity occurs across the order. Bats also exhibit extreme longevity given their body size with many species showing few signs of ageing. The molecular basis of this extended longevity has recently attracted attention. Telomere maintenance potentially underpins bats' extended healthspan, although functional studies are still required to validate the causative mechanisms. In this review, we detail the current knowledge on bat telomeres, telomerase expression, and how these relate to ecology, longevity and life-history strategies. Patterns of telomere shortening and telomerase expression vary across species, and comparative genomic analyses suggest that alternative telomere maintenance mechanisms evolved in the longest-lived bats. We discuss the unique challenges faced when working with populations of wild bats and highlight ways to advance the field including expanding long-term monitoring across species that display contrasting life-histories and occupy different environmental niches. We further review how new high quality, chromosome-level genome assemblies can enable us to uncover the molecular mechanisms governing telomere dynamics and how phylogenomic analyses can reveal the adaptive significance of telomere maintenance and variation in bats.

This puzzling mismatch suggests substantial barriers to establishment. We detail hypotheses that might contribute to explain the low numbers of endemic coronaviruses, despite their considerable evolutionary and emergence potential. We assess possible explanations ranging from issues of ascertainment, historically lower opportunities for spillover, aspects of human demographic changes, and features of pathogen biology and pre-existing adaptive immunity to related viruses. We describe how successful emergent viral species must triangulate transmission, virulence, and host immunity to maintain circulation. Characterizing the factors that might shape the limits of viral persistence can delineate promising research directions to better understand the combinations of pathogens and contexts that are most likely to lead to spillover.

As of July 25, 2021, there are 194,372,584 cases and 4,167,937 deaths with high variability in clinical manifestations, disease burden, and post-disease complications among different people around the globe. Overall, COVID-19 is manifested as mild to moderate in almost 90% of the cases and only the rest 10% of the cases need hospitalization. However, patients with older age and those having different comorbidities have made worst the pandemic scenario. The variability of pathological consequences and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 is associated with differential host-SARS-CoV-2 interactions, which are influenced by the factors that originated from the SARS-CoV-2 and the host. These factors usually include the genomic attributes and virulent factors of the SARS-CoV-2, the burden of coinfection with other viruses and bacteria, age and gender of the individuals, different comorbidities, immune suppressions/deficiency, genotypes of major histocompatibility complex, and blood group antigens and antibodies. We herein retrieved and reviewed literatures from PubMed, Scopus, and Google relevant to clinical complications and pathogenesis of COVID-19 among people of different age, sex, and geographical locations; genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its variants, host response under different variables, and comorbidities to summarize the dynamics of the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection; and host response toward approved vaccines and treatment strategies against COVID-19. After reviewing a large number of published articles covering different aspects of host response to SARS-CoV-2, it is clear that one aspect from one region is not working with the scenario same to others, as studies have been done separately with a very small number of cases from a particular area/region of a country. Importantly, to combat such a pandemic as COVID-19, a conclusive understanding of the disease dynamics is required. This review emphasizes on the identification of the factors influencing the dynamics of host responses to SARS-CoV-2 and offers a future perspective to explore the molecular insights of COVID-19.

J	Snell-Rood, Emilie C.; Smirnoff, Dimitri; Cantrell, Hunter; Chapman, Kaila; Kirscht, Elizabeth; Stretch, Elizabeth								Bioinspiration as a method of problem-based STEM education: A case study with a class structured around the COVID-19 crisis								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				11	23			16374	16386		10.1002/ece3.8044		AUG 2021		DEC 2021	2021	Bioinspiration is a promising lens for biology instruction as it allows the instructor to focus on current issues, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. From social distancing to oxygen stress, organisms have been tackling pandemic-related problems for millions of years. What can we learn from such diverse adaptations in our own applications? This review uses a seminar course on the COVID-19 crisis to illustrate bioinspiration as an approach to teaching biology content. At the start of the class, students mind-mapped the entire problem; this range of subproblems was used to structure the biology content throughout the entire class. Students came to individual classes with a brainstormed list of biological systems that could serve as inspiration for a particular problem (e.g., absorptive leaves in response to the problem of toilet paper shortages). After exploration of relevant biology content, discussion returned to the focal problem. Students dug deeper into the literature in a group project on mask design and biological systems relevant to filtration and transparency. This class structure was an engaging way for students to learn principles from ecology, evolution, behavior, and physiology. Challenges with this course design revolved around the interdisciplinary and creative nature of the structure; for instance, the knowledge of the participants was often stretched by engineering details. While the present class was focused on the COVID-19 crisis, a course structured through a bioinspired approach can be applied to other focal problems, or subject areas, giving instructors a powerful method to deliver interdisciplinary content in an integrated and inquiry-driven way.

J	Harder, Olivia E.; Martinez, Margaret; Niewiesk, Stefan								Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs restore immune function to respiratory syncytial virus in geriatric cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus)								VIROLOGY				563				28	37		10.1016/j.virol.2021.08.006		AUG 2021		NOV 2021	2021	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is not only a childhood disease, but also a serious health risk for the elderly. We investigated in cotton rats how age affected viral clearance, immune responses, and whether pharmacological intervention was beneficial. Our results demonstrated that in geriatric animals, virus grew to similar titers, but with delayed clearance, compared to adult animals. After primary infection with RSV, geriatric animals were susceptible to secondary infection and results indicated a defective humoral immune response. Depletion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) during primary infection delayed clearance, indicating the necessary role of CTL. Pharmacological intervention through nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen resulted in faster viral clearance and complete protection after immunization. In addition, the CTL response in the presence of ibuprofen seemed to be restored. It appears that in geriatric animals, immune functions are not as effective as in adult animals and that anti-inflammatory therapy may restore effective immune function.

While all known human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are speculated to have originated in animals, very little is known about their evolutionary history and factors that enable some CoVs to co-exist with humans as low pathogenic and endemic infections (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), while others, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have evolved to cause severe disease. In this review, we highlight the origins of all known HCoVs and map positively selected for mutations within HCoV proteins to discuss the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we discuss emerging mutations within SARS-CoV-2 and variants of concern (VOC), along with highlighting the demonstrated or speculated impact of these mutations on virus transmission, pathogenicity, and neutralization by natural or vaccine-mediated immunity.

The development of new drugs to manage COVID-19 effectively is a challenging and time-consuming process, thus encouraging extensive investigation of drug repurposing and repositioning candidates. Several medications, including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine, lopinavir, favipiravir, ribavirin, ritonavir, interferons, azithromycin, capivasertib and bevacizumab, are currently under clinical trials for COVID-19. In addition, several medicinal plants with considerable antiviral activities are potential therapeutic candidates for COVID-19. Statistical data show that the pandemic is yet to slow down, and authorities are placing their hopes on vaccines. Within a short period, four types of vaccines, namely, whole virus, viral vector, protein subunit, and nucleic acid (RNA/DNA), which can confer protection against COVID-19 in different ways, were already in a clinical trial. SARS-CoV-2 variants spread is associated with antibody escape from the virus Spike epitopes, which has grave concerns for viral re-infection and even compromises the effectiveness of the vaccines. Despite these efforts, COVID-19 treatment is still solely based on clinical management through supportive care. We aim to highlight the recent trends in COVID-19, relevant statistics, and clinical findings, as well as potential therapeutics, including in-line treatment methods, preventive measures, and vaccines to combat the prevalence of COVID-19.

J	Patino-Galindo, Juan Angel; Filip, Ioan; Chowdhury, Ratul; Maranas, Costas D.; Sorger, Peter K.; AlQuraishi, Mohammed; Rabadan, Raul								Recombination and lineage-specific mutations linked to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2								GENOME MEDICINE				13	1					124	10.1186/s13073-021-00943-6				AUG 6 2021	2021	Background The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 underscores the need to better understand the evolutionary processes that drive the emergence and adaptation of zoonotic viruses in humans. In the betacoronavirus genus, which also includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination frequently encompasses the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the Spike protein, which is responsible for viral binding to host cell receptors. In this work, we reconstruct the evolutionary events that have accompanied the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, with a special emphasis on the RBD and its adaptation for binding to its receptor, human ACE2. Methods By means of phylogenetic and recombination analyses, we found evidence of a recombination event in the RBD involving ancestral linages to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. We then assessed the effect of this recombination at protein level by reconstructing the RBD of the closest ancestors to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and other Sarbecoviruses, including the most recent common ancestor of the recombining clade. The resulting information was used to measure and compare, in silico, their ACE2-binding affinities using the physics-based trRosetta algorithm. Results We show that, through an ancestral recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share an RBD sequence that includes two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), as well as the variants 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts directly with the human ACE2 (hACE2) receptor. Reconstruction of ancestral states, combined with protein-binding affinity analyses, suggests that the recombination event involving ancestral strains of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 led to an increased affinity for hACE2 binding and that alleles 427N and 436Y significantly enhanced affinity as well. Conclusions We report an ancestral recombination event affecting the RBD of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 that was associated with an increased binding affinity to hACE2. Structural modeling indicates that ancestors of SARS-CoV-2 may have acquired the ability to infect humans decades ago. The binding affinity with the human receptor would have been subsequently boosted in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 through further mutations in RBD.																					WOS:000682519300001	34362430	
J	Orlandin, Jessica Rodrigues; Machado, Luciana Cristina; Ambrosio, Carlos Eduardo; Travagli, Valter								Ozone and its derivatives in veterinary medicine: A careful appraisal								VETERINARY AND ANIMAL SCIENCE				13						100191	10.1016/j.vas.2021.100191		AUG 2021		SEP 2021	2021	The therapeutic use of ozone and its derivatives in the veterinary medicine it is still in an emergent stage. Gaseous ozone chemical instability makes necessary its extemporaneous preparation and the accordance about ozone treatments with the highest quality standards in publications is of paramount importance. Moreover, the numerous method of administration in different animal species, the prevalence of case reports, the deficiency of consistent evaluation of the outcomes, as well as the lack of standardization of the treatment operating procedures represents an open question for its spreading and official approval. The keywords "ozone", "ozonated", "ozonation" "ozonized", "ozonization", "oxygen-ozone therapy", "veterinary", "pets", "animal" were used to perform a literature review using PubMed, Cochrane, Google Scholar, Zotero databases with the temporal restriction for published manuscripts starting from 2010. All the researches were critically evaluated, regardless of the impact factor, if any, of the journals in which they were presented. The deepening of the mechanisms of action of this bio-oxidative therapy can open new horizons on its use. The distinctive condition to achieve such a scenario is an improved knowledge of the qualitative/quantitative characteristics of ozone and its derivatives. All with the aim of taking nothing away to the cited original research papers, but of improving the promising therapeutic implications of ozone therapy in veterinary medicine as a standardization stimulus about this therapeutic resource with multiple application specificities.

J	Ohimain, Elijah Ige								Ecology of Ebolaviruses								CURRENT OPINION IN PHARMACOLOGY				60				66	71		10.1016/j.coph.2021.06.009		AUG 2021		OCT 2021	2021	Africa is becoming known for the emergence and re-emergence of Ebola virus. The virus, which was initially restricted to East and Central Africa, is now emerging in West Africa. Ecological aspects of Ebola virus diseases are poorly understood. It is suspected that the virus is circulating in the forests of Africa, mostly hosted by migratory bats, which spread the virus to other wildlife particularly great apes and duikers. Spillovers occur when humans have contacts with wildlife. Transmission of the virus within human systems occurs through contacts with body fluids of an infected person. Several factors seem to be responsible for the emergence and re-emergence of the virus in Africa including circulation of the virus in forest ecosystems, persistence of the virus in body fluids (during sickness, upon death, and in survivors), transmission through diverse routes (direct contacts, fomites, oral), presence of infected migratory bats and other wildlife species, forest encroachment, and climatic and seasonal changes. Recent studies show that fresh outbreaks can emerge not only from wildlife but also from survivors of previous outbreaks. It is therefore important to understand the ecology of the virus in order to mitigate future emergence.																					WOS:000701245000010	34358792

Stanford COVID-19 Biobank						Multi-omic profiling reveals widespread dysregulation of innate immunity and hematopoiesis in COVID-19								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE				218	8					e20210582	10.1084/jem.20210582				AUG 2 2021	2021	Our understanding of protective versus pathological immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is limited by inadequate profiling of patients at the extremes of the disease severity spectrum. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell immune profiling of 64 COVID-19 patients across the full range of disease severity, from outpatients with mild disease to fatal cases. Our transcriptomic, epigenomic, and proteomic analyses revealed widespread dysfunction of peripheral innate immunity in severe and fatal COVID-19, including prominent hyperactivation signatures in neutrophils and NK cells. We also identified chromatin accessibility changes at NF-kappa B binding sites within cytokine gene loci as a potential mechanism for the striking lack of pro-inflammatory cytokine production observed in monocytes in severe and fatal COVID-19. We further demonstrated that emergency myelopoiesis is a prominent feature of fatal COVID-19. Collectively, our results reveal disease severity-associated immune phenotypes in COVID-19 and identify pathogenesis-associated pathways that are potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by World Health Organization in March 2020 for its continuous and rapid spread worldwide. Rapidly emerging COVID-19 epicenters and mutants of concerns have created mammoth chaos in healthcare sectors across the globe. With over 185 million infections and approximately 4 million deaths globally, COVID-19 continues its unchecked spread despite all mitigation measures. Until effective and affordable antiretroviral drugs are made available and the population at large is vaccinated, timely diagnosis of the infection and adoption of COVID-appropriate behavior remains major tool available to curtail the still escalating COVID-19 pandemic. This review provides an updated overview of various techniques of COVID-19 testing in human samples and also discusses, in brief, the biochemical composition and mode of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. Technological advancement in various molecular, serological and immunological techniques including mainly the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), CRISPR, lateral flow assays (LFAs), and immunosensors are reviewed.

Three Immunocompetent Small Animal Models That Do Not Support Zika Virus Infection								PATHOGENS				10	8					971	10.3390/pathogens10080971				AUG 2021	2021	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. ZIKV causes disease in infected humans with added complications of Guillain-Barre syndrome and birth defects in infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy. There are several large immunocompetent animal models for ZIKV including non-human primates (NHPs). NHP models closely reflect human infection; however, due to sample size restrictions, investigations into the effects of transmission route and the impacts on disease dynamics have been understudied. Mice have been widely used for modeling ZIKV infection, yet there are few ZIKV-susceptible immunocompetent mouse models and none of these have been used to investigate sexual transmission. In an effort to identify a small immunocompetent animal model to characterize sexual transmission of ZIKV, we attempt experimental infection of multimammate mice, New Zealand white rabbits, and Hartley guinea pigs. The multimammate mouse is the natural reservoir of Lassa fever virus and has been identified to harbor other human pathogens. Likewise, while NZW rabbits are susceptible to West Nile virus, they have not yet been examined for their susceptibility to infection with ZIKV. Guinea pigs have been successfully used as models for ZIKV infection, but only in immunocompromised life stages (young or pregnant). Here, it was found that the multimammate mouse and New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits are not susceptible ZIKV infection as determined by a lack viral RNA in tissues and fluids collected. Sexually mature male Hartley guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously and by mosquito bite, but found to be refractory to ZIKV infection, contrary to findings of other studies in young and pregnant guinea pigs. Interestingly, here it is shown that adult male guinea pigs are not susceptible to ZIKV infection, even when infected by natural route (e.g., mosquito bite). Although a new small animal model for the sexual transmission for ZIKV was not established through this study, these findings provide information on outbred animal species that are not permissive to infection (NZW rabbits and multimammate mice) and new information surrounding limitations of a previously established animal model (guinea pigs).

Common Themes in Zoonotic Spillover and Disease Emergence: Lessons Learned from Bat- and Rodent-Borne RNA Viruses								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	8					1509	10.3390/v13081509				AUG 2021	2021	Rodents (order Rodentia), followed by bats (order Chiroptera), comprise the largest percentage of living mammals on earth. Thus, it is not surprising that these two orders account for many of the reservoirs of the zoonotic RNA viruses discovered to date. The spillover of these viruses from wildlife to human do not typically result in pandemics but rather geographically confined outbreaks of human infection and disease. While limited geographically, these viruses cause thousands of cases of human disease each year. In this review, we focus on three questions regarding zoonotic viruses that originate in bats and rodents. First, what biological strategies have evolved that allow RNA viruses to reside in bats and rodents? Second, what are the environmental and ecological causes that drive viral spillover? Third, how does virus spillover occur from bats and rodents to humans?																					WOS:000690085300001	34452374

This novel pegivirus strain is phylogenetically distinct from previously known Pegivirus species, Pegivirus A-K, and qualifies as a candidate new Pegivirus species, GPgV. GPgV is tentatively named Pegivirus M. Here, to better understand the epidemic of GPgV infection and the coinfection of this virus with other viruses in Southwest China, 25 geese in poor health from Sichuan Province and 24 geese in poor health from the municipality of Chongqing were collected. The geese were tested for 9 types of goose viruses (goose hemorrhagic polyomavirus, GPgV, astrovirus, parvovirus, circovirus, reovirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, and avian influenza virus) by RT-PCR or nested RT-PCR. GPgV RNA was detected in 2 out of 25 monoinfections and 8 out of 25 coinfections with other viruses on Sichuan farms and 2 out of 24 monoinfections and 10 out of 24 coinfections on Chongqing farms. Overall, 22 of the 49 (44.9%) geese were positive for GPgV, which indicated a high infection rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of GPgV coinfection with other epidemic viruses. This study enhances our understanding of the emergence and epidemiology of Pegivirus.																					WOS:000681749100044	34175799

The transmission routes primarily involve blood products, and infections are worldwide, leading up to 25% of persistent infections. To date, no effective therapeutic means are available to clear Pegivirus infections. Effective vaccine therapeutics is the best alternative to manage this disease and any associated potential pandemic. Thus, whole proteome-based mining of immunogenic peptides, i.e., CTL (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), HTL (helper T lymphocytes), and B cell epitopes, was mapped to design a vaccine ensemble. Our investigation revealed that 29 different epitopes impart a critical role in immune response induction, which was also validated by exploring its physiochemical properties and experimental feasibility. In silico expression and host immune simulation were examined using an agent-based modeling approach and confirmed the induction of both primary and secondary immune factors such as IL, cytokines, and antibodies. The current study warrants further lab experiments to demonstrate its efficacy and safety.																					WOS:000690229800001	34451943

However, the underlying mechanisms and diagnostic approaches remain to be determined. We interrogated the expression of virus-related host factors in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets of normal human kidneys and kidneys with pre-existing diseases and validated the results with urinary proteomics of COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals. We also assessed the effects of genetic variants on kidney susceptibility using expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) databases. We identified a subtype of tubular cells, which we named PT-3 cells, as being vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infections in the kidneys. PT-3 cells were enriched in viral entry factors and replication and assembly machinery but lacked antiviral restriction factors. Immunohistochemistry confirmed positive staining of PT-3 cell marker SCL36A2 on kidney sections from COVID-19 patients. Urinary proteomic analyses of COVID-19 patients revealed that markers of PT-3 cells were significantly increased, along with elevated viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. We further found that the proportion of PT-3 cells increased in diabetic nephropathy but decreased in kidney allografts and lupus nephropathy, suggesting that kidney susceptibility varied among these diseases. We finally identified several eQTLs that regulate the expression of host factors in kidney cells. PT-3 cells may represent a key determinant for the kidney tropism of SARS-CoV-2, and detection of PT-3 cells may be used to assess the risk of renal infection during COVID-19.

J	Gortazar, Christian; Barroso, Patricia; Nova, Rodrigo; Caceres, German								The role of wildlife in the epidemiology and control of Foot-and-mouth-disease And Similar Transboundary (FAST) animal diseases: A review								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES											10.1111/tbed.14235		JUL 2021			2021	Transboundary Animal Diseases (TADs) are notifiable diseases which are highly transmissible and have the potential for rapid spread regardless of national borders. Many TADs are shared between domestic animals and wildlife, with the potential to affect both livestock sector and wildlife conservation and eventually, public health in the case of zoonosis. The European Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD), a commission of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has grouped six TADs as 'Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) And Similar Transboundary animal diseases' (FAST diseases). FAST diseases are ruminant infections caused by viruses, for which vaccination is a control option. The EuFMD hold-FAST strategy aims primarily at addressing the threat represented by FAST diseases for Europe. Prevention and control of FAST diseases might benefit from assessing the role of wildlife. We reviewed the role of wildlife as indicators, victims, bridge hosts or maintenance hosts for the six TADs included in the EuFMD hold-FAST strategy: FMD, peste des petits ruminants, lumpy skin disease, sheep and goatpox, Rift Valley fever and bovine ephemeral fever. We observed that wildlife can act as indicator species. In addition, they are occasionally victims of disease outbreaks, and they are often relevant for disease management as either bridge or maintenance hosts. Wildlife deserves to become a key component of future integrated surveillance and disease control strategies in an ever-changing world. It is advisable to increase our knowledge on wildlife roles in relevant TADs to improve our preparedness in case of an outbreak in previously disease-free regions, where wildlife may be significant for disease surveillance and control.

Epidemiological surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in dogs requires testing to distinguish it from other canine coronaviruses. In the last year, significant advances have been made in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, allowing its surveillance in both human and animal populations. Here, using ELISA and automated western blotting (AWB) assays, we performed a longitudinal study on 809 apparently healthy dogs from different regions of France to investigate anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. There were three main groups: (i) 356 dogs sampled once before the pandemic, (ii) 235 dogs sampled once during the pandemic, and (iii) 218 dogs, including 82 dogs sampled twice (before and during the pandemic), 125 dogs sampled twice during the pandemic and 11 dogs sampled three times (once before and twice during the pandemic). Using ELISA, seroprevalence was significantly higher during the pandemic [5.5% (25/453)] than during the pre-pandemic period [1.1% (5/449)]. Among the 218 dogs sampled twice, at least 8 ELISA-seroconversions were observed. ELISA positive pre-pandemic sera were not confirmed in serial tests by AWB, indicating possible ELISA cross-reactivity, probably with other canine coronaviruses. A significant difference was observed between these two serological tests (Q = 88, p = 0.008). A clear correlation was observed between SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in dogs and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in human population from the same area. AWB could be used as a second line assay to confirm the doubtful and discrepant ELISA results in dogs. Our results confirm the previous experimental models regarding the susceptibility of dogs to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that viral transmission from and between dogs is weak or absent. However, the new variants with multiple mutations could adapt to dogs; this hypothesis cannot be ruled out in the absence of genomic data on SARS-CoV-2 from dogs.

There are currently no approved antiviral therapeutics or vaccines for use in humans to treat or prevent NiV or HeV infection. To facilitate development of henipavirus antivirals, a high-throughput screening (HTS) platform was developed based on a well-characterized recombinant version of the nonpathogenic Henipavirus, Cedar virus (rCedV). Using reverse genetics, a rCedV encoding firefly luciferase (rCedV-Luc) was rescued and its utility evaluated for high-throughput antiviral compound screening. The luciferase reporter gene signal kinetics of rCedV-Luc in different human cell lines was characterized and validated as an authentic real-time measure of viral growth. The rCedV-Luc platform was optimized as an HTS assay that demonstrated high sensitivity with robust Z' scores, excellent signal-to-background ratios and coefficients of variation. Eight candidate compounds that inhibited rCedV replication were identified for additional validation and demonstrated that 4 compounds inhibited authentic NiV-Bangladesh replication. Further evaluation of 2 of the 4 validated compounds in a 9-point dose response titration demonstrated potent antiviral activity against NiV-Bangladesh and HeV, with minimal cytotoxicity. This rCedV reporter can serve as a surrogate yet authentic BSL-2 henipavirus platform that will dramatically accelerate drug candidate identification in the development of anti-henipavirus therapies.

In the last two decades the world has withstood many contagious disease crashes. SARS-CoV-2 has put the world and the mankind in danger. It is spreading unstoppably all over the world. The virus is evolving and thus the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 strains has been different and making it difficult to develop a broad-spectrum anti-viral molecule that would be effective against all the SARS-CoV-2 variants. This imperative situation demands development of molecules for effective treatment against SARS-CoV-2. The phytomolecules or the bioactive molecules of plants could be a great alternative to combat SARS-CoV-2. The bioactive molecules with their antiviral properties and the secondary metabolites may effectively deactivate the functioning of viral proteins. The structural configuration of 2019-nCoV proteins and genomic information are available, thus contributing immensely for fast molecular docking studies and hence, enables screening of numerous accessible phytomolecules. In the current study, we have essentially highlighted common phytomolecules against the known viral proteins and described the mode of action of few plant-derived molecules which have the potential to suppress the activity of the viral proteins.[GRAPHICS].

Different strains of these viruses have caused pandemic in the past such as Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 and recently Severe Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known as COVID-19 in December 2019. Scientists utilised different approaches for the detection and characterisation of CoVs using samples such as serum, throat swabs, nose swabs, nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavages. The two common approaches include antigen-based approach and molecular diagnostic approach, which are hindered by limitations such as low sensitivity and requirement for high level of biosafety during isolation of the virus from cell culture. Thus, there is a need for developing a more rapid, sensitive, simple and cheap diagnostic kit for diagnosis of different strains of coronavirus. In this article, we overview 2019 novel coronavirus, pandemic, prior epidemics, diagnosis, treatments, identification of drugs detection based on classification and prediction using artificial intelligence-driven tools. We also overview in-lab molecular testing and on-site testing using CRISPR-based biosensing tools. We also outline limitations of laboratory techniques and open-research issues in the current state of CRISPR-based biosensing applications and artificial intelligence for treatment of Coronaviruses.

J	Chazal, Nathalie								Coronavirus, the King Who Wanted More Than a Crown: From Common to the Highly Pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, Is the Key in the Accessory Genes?								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				12						682603	10.3389/fmicb.2021.682603				JUL 14 2021	2021	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), that emerged in late 2019, is the etiologic agent of the current "coronavirus disease 2019" (COVID-19) pandemic, which has serious health implications and a significant global economic impact. Of the seven human coronaviruses, all of which have a zoonotic origin, the pandemic SARS-CoV-2, is the third emerging coronavirus, in the 21st century, highly pathogenic to the human population. Previous human coronavirus outbreaks (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV) have already provided several valuable information on some of the common molecular and cellular mechanisms of coronavirus infections as well as their origin. However, to meet the new challenge caused by the SARS-CoV-2, a detailed understanding of the biological specificities, as well as knowledge of the origin are crucial to provide information on viral pathogenicity, transmission and epidemiology, and to enable strategies for therapeutic interventions and drug discovery. Therefore, in this review, we summarize the current advances in SARS-CoV-2 knowledges, in light of pre-existing information of other recently emerging coronaviruses. We depict the specificity of the immune response of wild bats and discuss current knowledge of the genetic diversity of bat-hosted coronaviruses that promotes viral genome expansion (accessory gene acquisition). In addition, we describe the basic virology of coronaviruses with a special focus SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we highlight, in detail, the current knowledge of genes and accessory proteins which we postulate to be the major keys to promote virus adaptation to specific hosts (bat and human), to contribute to the suppression of immune responses, as well as to pathogenicity.

In this study, a large-scale serological survey of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in dogs and cats was conducted during the first and second waves of COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand, from April to December 2020. A total of 3215 serum samples were collected from dogs (n = 2102) and cats (n = 1113) living in Bangkok and in the vicinities. Serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies by using an indirect multispecies enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Positive and suspected samples were additionally tested for neutralizing antibodies by the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT). The indirect ELISA results showed that 1.66% (35 out of 2103) of dogs and 0.36% (four out of 1112) of cats were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The sVNT results showed that all ELISA-positive and suspected samples were negative for neutralizing antibodies. Positive serum samples (35 dogs and four cats) were obtained from clinically healthy animals and animals with mild respiratory signs aged <1-13 years living in Bangkok and Samutprakarn Provinces. In summary, a serological survey revealed evidence of anti-N-IgG antibodies suggesting SARS-CoV-2 exposure in both dogs and cats during the first and second COVID-19 outbreaks in Thailand.

Post COVID-19: a solution scan of options for preventing future zoonotic epidemics								BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS				96	6			2694	2715		10.1111/brv.12774		JUL 2021		DEC 2021	2021	The crisis generated by the emergence and pandemic spread of COVID-19 has thrown into the global spotlight the dangers associated with novel diseases, as well as the key role of animals, especially wild animals, as potential sources of pathogens to humans. There is a widespread demand for a new relationship with wild and domestic animals, including suggested bans on hunting, wildlife trade, wet markets or consumption of wild animals. However, such policies risk ignoring essential elements of the problem as well as alienating and increasing hardship for local communities across the world, and might be unachievable at scale. There is thus a need for a more complex package of policy and practical responses. We undertook a solution scan to identify and collate 161 possible options for reducing the risks of further epidemic disease transmission from animals to humans, including potential further SARS-CoV-2 transmission (original or variants). We include all categories of animals in our responses (i.e. wildlife, captive, unmanaged/feral and domestic livestock and pets) and focus on pathogens (especially viruses) that, once transmitted from animals to humans, could acquire epidemic potential through high rates of human-to-human transmission. This excludes measures to prevent well-known zoonotic diseases, such as rabies, that cannot readily transmit between humans. We focused solutions on societal measures, excluding the development of vaccines and other preventive therapeutic medicine and veterinary medicine options that are discussed elsewhere. We derived our solutions through reading the scientific literature, NGO position papers, and industry guidelines, collating our own experiences, and consulting experts in different fields. Herein, we review the major zoonotic transmission pathways and present an extensive list of options. The potential solutions are organised according to the key stages of the trade chain and encompass solutions that can be applied at the local, regional and international scales. This is a set of options targeted at practitioners and policy makers to encourage careful examination of possible courses of action, validating their impact and documenting outcomes.

Here, the authors present the crystal structure of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) bound to its receptor, dog angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (dACE2), and show that the RBD N501Y mutation increases the infectivity and host range of SARS-CoV-2, which highlights the need to monitor emerging SARS-CoV-2 mutations in domestic animals.SARS-CoV-2 can infect many domestic animals, including dogs. Herein, we show that dog angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (dACE2) can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein receptor binding domain (RBD), and that both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 can infect dACE2-expressing cells. We solved the crystal structure of RBD in complex with dACE2 and found that the total number of contact residues, contact atoms, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges at the binding interface in this complex are slightly fewer than those in the complex of the RBD and human ACE2 (hACE2). This result is consistent with the fact that the binding affinity of RBD to dACE2 is lower than that of hACE2. We further show that a few important mutations in the RBD binding interface play a pivotal role in the binding affinity of RBD to both dACE2 and hACE2. Our work reveals a molecular basis for cross-species transmission and potential animal spread of SARS-CoV-2, and provides new clues to block the potential transmission chains of this virus.

Animal Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the Welfare of Animals during the COVID-19 Pandemic								ANIMALS				11	7					2044	10.3390/ani11072044				JUL 2021	2021	Simple Summary The accelerated pace of research into Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitates periodic summaries of current research. The present paper reviews virus susceptibilities in species commonly in contact with humans and predictors of susceptibility. With few exceptions, species selected for review were those in contact with humans through the entertainment, pet, or agricultural trades, and for whom report-either anecdotal or published-exist regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or the resulting disease state COVID-19. The possibility of humans transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to animals and fear of animals transmitting the virus to humans endangers animal wellbeing; use of animals as research models also has welfare implications. As the search for appropriate animal models for SARS-CoV-2 continues, it is important to determine which species are most appropriate, so that the "three R's" of animal research (replacement, reduction, and refinement) may be put into practice. The present review suggests that ferrets, golden Syrian hamsters, and some Old World nonhuman primates may be the best animal models for COVID-19-related research, as these species display the greatest similarity in factors underlying viral infection, as well as clinical symptoms upon viral exposure most similar to those seen in humans. The accelerated pace of research into Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) necessitates periodic summaries of current research. The present paper reviews virus susceptibilities in species with frequent human contact, and factors that are best predictors of virus susceptibility. Species reviewed were those in contact with humans through entertainment, pet, or agricultural trades, and for whom reports (either anecdotal or published) exist regarding the SARS-CoV-2 virus and/or the resulting disease state COVID-19. Available literature was searched using an artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted engine, as well as via common databases, such as Web of Science and Medline. The present review focuses on susceptibility and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and polymorphisms in transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that contribute to species differences. Dogs and pigs appear to have low susceptibility, while ferrets, mink, some hamster species, cats, and nonhuman primates (particularly Old World species) have high susceptibility. Precautions may therefore be warranted in interactions with such species, and more selectivity practiced when choosing appropriate species to serve as models for research.

This and other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, have been suggested to be related to coronaviruses that are hosted in bats. This work shows, through a bibliographic review, the frequency of detection of coronavirus in bats species of the Americas. The presence of coronavirus in bats has been examined in 25 investigations in 11 countries of the Americas between 2007 and 2020. Coronaviruses have been explored in 9371 individuals from 160 species of bats, and 187 coronavirus sequences have been deposited in GenBank distributed in 43 species of bats. While 91% of the coronaviruses sequences identified infect a single species of bat, the remainder show a change of host, dominating the intragenera change. So far, only Mex-CoV-6 is related to MERS-CoV, a coronavirus pathogenic for humans, so further coronavirus research effort in yet unexplored bat species is warranted.

It is an infectious disease that has caused concern since ancient times, due to the fear that it has produced, and which did not cease despite the discovery of a vaccine in 1885. The main objective of this article is the study of this disease in the context of Hispanic America, with its contrasts with respect to theEuropean world, in its origin and development, as well as its medical and superstitious solutions. Therefore, it is of interest, in addition to the manifestations of the disease, the social and cultural aspects that it generated, including, in reference to criollismo, the promotion of purely American remedies. Consequently, a selective bibliography was used and American and Spanish libraries, newspaper libraries and archives were consulted from which were obtained the necessary materials to reach some conclusions that nuance what has already been stated, especially by experimental scientists, paying attention to the influence that the disease had, not only on the individual, but also on the society around them, and on the powers of the state, which was forced to make decisions in accordance with the problem.

Body size affects immune cell proportions in birds and non-volant mammals, but not bats								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY				224	13					jeb241109	10.1242/jeb.241109				JUL 2021	2021	Powered flight has evolved several times in vertebrates and constrains morphology and physiology in ways that likely have shaped how organisms cope with infections. Some of these constraints probably have impacts on aspects of immunology, such that larger fliers might prioritize risk reduction and safety. Addressing how the evolution of flight may have driven relationships between body size and immunity could be particularly informative for understanding the propensity of some taxa to harbor many virulent and sometimes zoonotic pathogens without showing clinical disease. Here, we used a comparative framework to quantify scaling relationships between body mass and the proportions of two types of white blood cells - lymphocytes and granulocytes (neutrophils/heterophils) - across 63 bat species, 400 bird species and 251 nonvolant mammal species. By using phylogenetically informed statistical models on field-collected data from wild Neotropical bats and from captive bats, non-volant mammals and birds, we show that lymphocyte and neutrophil proportions do not vary systematically with body mass among bats. In contrast, larger birds and non-volant mammals have disproportionately higher granulocyte proportions than expected for their body size. Our inability to distinguish bat lymphocyte scaling from birds and bat granulocyte scaling from all other taxa suggests there may be other ecological explanations (i.e. not flight related) for the cell proportion scaling patterns. Future comparative studies of wild bats, birds and non-volant mammals of similar body mass should aim to further differentiate evolutionary effects and other aspects of life history on immune defense and its role in the tolerance of (zoonotic) infections.

However, the findings of interdisciplinary research are susceptible to miscommunication among both professional and non-professional audiences due to differences in training, language, experience, and understanding. Such miscommunication contributes to the misunderstanding of key concepts or processes and hinders the development of effective research agendas and public policy. These misunderstandings can also provoke unnecessary fear in the public and have devastating effects for wildlife conservation. For example, inaccurate communication and subsequent misunderstanding of the potential associations between certain bats and zoonoses has led to persecution of diverse bats worldwide and even government calls to cull them. Here, we identify four types of miscommunication driven by the use of terminology regarding bats and the emergence of zoonotic diseases that we have categorized based on their root causes: (1) incorrect or overly broad use of terms; (2) terms that have unstable usage within a discipline, or different usages among disciplines; (3) terms that are used correctly but spark incorrect inferences about biological processes or significance in the audience; (4) incorrect inference drawn from the evidence presented. We illustrate each type of miscommunication with commonly misused or misinterpreted terms, providing a definition, caveats and common misconceptions, and suggest alternatives as appropriate. While we focus on terms specific to bats and disease ecology, we present a more general framework for addressing miscommunication that can be applied to other topics and disciplines to facilitate more effective research, problem-solving, and public policy.

Blood and nasopharyngeal samples were taken simultaneously at the referring time. The diagnostic accuracy of ELISA-based IgM and IgG antibody tests for COVID-19 were compared with the rRT-PCR.ResultsThe calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, overall diagnostic accuracy, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.5745, 0.9767, 0.9643, 0.6774, 24.66, 0.4357, 0.7667, and 56.60 for IgM; and 0.6170, 0.9302, 0.9355, 0.6897, 8.84, 0.4117, 0.7667, and 21.47 for IgG, respectively.ConclusionDue to the lower sensitivity of antibody detection-based serological tests compared to rRT-PCR, they cannot be considered as initial and reliable tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19. It can be suggested that the serological tests be only used as complementary tests to rRT-PCR or for monitoring the immune response of children with COVID-19.

To identify these molecules, we followed a combinatorial structure-based strategy, which includes high-throughput virtual screening, molecular docking and WaterMap calculations. The study was carried out using Protein Data Bank structures 5R82 and 6Y2G. DrugBank, Enamine, Natural product and Specs databases, along with a few known antiviral drugs, were used for the screening.

J	Piplani, Sakshi; Singh, Puneet Kumar; Winkler, David A.; Petrovsky, Nikolai								In silico comparison of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-ACE2 binding affinities across species and implications for virus origin								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					13063	10.1038/s41598-021-92388-5				JUN 24 2021	2021	The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has raised important questions about its origins and the mechanism of its transfer to humans. A further question was whether companion or commercial animals could act as SARS-CoV-2 vectors, with early data suggesting susceptibility is species specific. To better understand SARS-CoV-2 species susceptibility, we undertook an in silico structural homology modelling, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulation study of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein's ability to bind angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from relevant species. Spike protein exhibited the highest binding to human (h)ACE2 of all the species tested, forming the highest number of hydrogen bonds with hACE2. Interestingly, pangolin ACE2 showed the next highest binding affinity despite having a relatively low sequence homology, whereas the affinity of monkey ACE2 was much lower despite its high sequence similarity to hACE2. These differences highlight the power of a structural versus a sequence-based approach to cross-species analyses. ACE2 species in the upper half of the predicted affinity range (monkey, hamster, dog, ferret, cat) have been shown to be permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection, supporting a correlation between binding affinity and infection susceptibility. These findings show that the earliest known SARS-CoV-2 isolates were surprisingly well adapted to bind strongly to human ACE2, helping explain its efficient human to human respiratory transmission. This study highlights how in silico structural modelling methods can be used to rapidly generate information on novel viruses to help predict their behaviour and aid in countermeasure development.

Using imagery and computer vision as remote monitoring methods for early detection of respiratory disease in pigs								COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE				187						106283	10.1016/j.compag.2021.106283		JUN 2021		AUG 2021	2021	Respiratory diseases in pigs impact the wellbeing of animals and increase the cost of production. One of the most appropriate approaches to minimizing these negative effects is the early detection of ill animals. The use of cameras coupled with computer-based techniques could assist the early detection of physiological changes in pigs when they are beginning to become ill and prior to exhibiting clinical signs. This study consisted of two experiments that aimed to (a) evaluate the use of computer-based techniques over RGB (red, green, and blue) and thermal infrared imagery to measure heart rate and respiration rate of pigs, and (b) to investigate whether eyetemperature, heart rate and respiration rate assessed remotely could be used to identify early signs of respiratory diseases in free-moving, and group-housed growing pigs in a commercial piggery. In the first experiment, the remotely-obtained heart rate and respiration rate were compared with the measures obtained with standard methods, showing positive correlations (r = 0.61 - 0.66; p < 0.05). In the second experiment, pigs were recorded by overhead cameras and the remotely-obtained physiological measures were analysed to identify whether physiological changes could be detected in sick pigs before clinical signs were observed. The changes in eyetemperature and heart rate remotely obtained showed clear differences between sick and healthy pigs two days before clinical signs were detected. While significant changes in respiration rate occurred the day before clinical signs of illness were identified. The results of the present study indicate the possible use of computer vision technique for constant animal monitoring and rapid detection of physiological changes related to illness in commercial pigs. Further research is recommended to continue the development, automatization, and commercial practicality of this novel technology.																					WOS:000696737400002

Despite the authorized treatment against COVID-19 by the European Union (EU), the safety and effectiveness of this therapeutic strategy for a wide variety of patients have remained a significant challenge. In this respect, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, as essential factors, can be considered for improving the function of the immune system and accelerating the treatment procedure. Dietary supplements can attenuate vascular and inflammatory manifestations related to infectious diseases in large part due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, it has been revealed that poor nutritional status may be one of the notable risk factors in severe COVID-19 infections. In the current review, we focus on the micronutrient therapy of COVID-19 patients and provide a comprehensive insight into the essential vitamins/minerals and their role in controlling the severity of the COVID-19 infection. We also discuss the recent advancements, challenges, negative and positive outcomes in relevance to this approach.																					WOS:000664850700001	34160789

The Immunopathobiology of SARS-CoV-2 Infection								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS				45	6					fuab035	10.1093/femsre/fuab035		JUN 2021		NOV 2021	2021	Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Virus-specific immunity controls infection, transmission and disease severity. With respect to disease severity, a spectrum of clinical outcomes occur associated with age, genetics, comorbidities and immune responses in an infected person. Dysfunctions in innate and adaptive immunity commonly follow viral infection. These are heralded by altered innate mononuclear phagocyte differentiation, activation, intracellular killing and adaptive memory, effector, and regulatory T cell responses. All of such affect viral clearance and the progression of end-organ disease. Failures to produce effective controlled antiviral immunity leads to life-threatening end-organ disease that is typified by the acute respiratory distress syndrome. The most effective means to contain SARS-CoV-2 infection is by vaccination. While an arsenal of immunomodulators were developed for control of viral infection and subsequent COVID-19 disease, further research is required to enable therapeutic implementation.

Zoonotic and Reverse Zoonotic Transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2								VIRUS RESEARCH				302						198473	10.1016/j.virusres.2021.198473		JUN 2021		SEP 2021	2021	The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus. Its causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), appears to be capable of infecting different mammalian species. Recent detections of this virus in pet, zoo, wild, and farm animals have compelled inquiry regarding the zoonotic (animal-to-human) and reverse zoonotic (human-to-animal) transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 with the potential of COVID-19 pandemic evolving into a panzootic. It is important to monitor the global spread of disease and to assess the significance of genomic changes to support prevention and control efforts during a pandemic. An understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology provides opportunities to prevent the risk of repeated re-infection of humans and requires a robust One Healthbased investigation. This review paper describes the known properties and the existing gaps in scientific knowledge about the zoonotic and reverse zoonotic transmissibility of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 and the COVID-19 disease it causes.

They are long living effector cells equipped with different receptors that allow microbial recognition. Once activated, MCs release numerous biologically active mediators in the site of pathogen contact, which induce vascular endothelium modification, inflammation development and extracellular matrix remodeling. Efficient and direct antimicrobial mechanisms of MCs involve phagocytosis with oxidative and non-oxidative microbial destruction, extracellular trap formation, and the release of antimicrobial substances. MCs also contribute to host defense through the attraction and activation of phagocytic and inflammatory cells, shaping the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, as part of their response to pathogens and under an impaired, sustained, or systemic activation, MCs may contribute to tissue damage. This review will focus on the current knowledge about direct and indirect contribution of MCs to pathogen clearance. Antimicrobial mechanisms of MCs are addressed with special attention to signaling pathways involved and molecular weapons implicated. The role of MCs in a dysregulated host response that can increase morbidity and mortality is also reviewed and discussed, highlighting the complexity of MCs biology in the context of host-pathogen interactions.

Due to the profound effects of novel coronaviruses, growing tides of research are emerging in various research fields. This paper employs a co-word analysis approach to map the intellectual structure of the coronavirus literature for a better understanding of how coronavirus research and the disease itself have developed during the target timeframe. A strategic diagram has been drawn to depict the coronavirus domain's structure and development. A detailed picture of coronavirus literature has been extracted from a huge number of papers to provide a quick overview of the coronavirus literature. The main themes of past coronavirus-related publications are (a) "Antibody-Virus Interactions," (b) "Emerging Infectious Diseases," (c) "Protein Structure-based Drug Design and Antiviral Drug Discovery," (d) "Coronavirus Detection Methods," (e) "Viral Pathogenesis and Immunity," and (f) "Animal Coronaviruses." The emerging infectious diseases are mostly related to fatal diseases (such as Middle East respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and COVID-19) and animal coronaviruses (including porcine, turkey, feline, canine, equine, and bovine coronaviruses and infectious bronchitis virus), which are capable of placing animal-dependent industries such as the swine and poultry industries under strong economic pressure. Although considerable research into coronavirus has been done, this unique field has not yet matured sufficiently. Therefore, "Antibody-virus Interactions," "Emerging Infectious Diseases," and "Coronavirus Detection Methods" hold interesting, promising research gaps to be both explored and filled in the future.

Pathogenesis, MicroRNA-122 Gene-Regulation, and Protective Immune Responses After Acute Equine Hepacivirus Infection								HEPATOLOGY				74	3			1148	1163		10.1002/hep.31802		JUN 2021		SEP 2021	2021	Background and Aims Equine hepacivirus (EqHV) is phylogenetically the closest relative of HCV and shares genome organization, hepatotropism, transient or persistent infection outcome, and the ability to cause hepatitis. Thus, EqHV studies are important to understand equine liver disease and further as an outbred surrogate animal model for HCV pathogenesis and protective immune responses. Here, we aimed to characterize the course of EqHV infection and associated protective immune responses.Approach and Results Seven horses were experimentally inoculated with EqHV, monitored for 6 months, and rechallenged with the same and, subsequently, a heterologous EqHV. Clearance was the primary outcome (6 of 7) and was associated with subclinical hepatitis characterized by lymphocytic infiltrate and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Seroconversion was delayed and antibody titers waned slowly. Clearance of primary infection conferred nonsterilizing immunity, resulting in shortened duration of viremia after rechallenge. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses in horses were minimal, although EqHV-specific T cells were identified. Additionally, an interferon-stimulated gene signature was detected in the liver during EqHV infection, similar to acute HCV in humans. EqHV, as HCV, is stimulated by direct binding of the liver-specific microRNA (miR), miR-122. Interestingly, we found that EqHV infection sequesters enough miR-122 to functionally affect gene regulation in the liver. This RNA-based mechanism thus could have consequences for pathology.Conclusions EqHV infection in horses typically has an acute resolving course, and the protective immune response lasts for at least a year and broadly attenuates subsequent infections. This could have important implications to achieve the primary goal of an HCV vaccine; to prevent chronicity while accepting acute resolving infection after virus exposure.

Bat E-Commerce: Insights Into the Extent and Potential Implications of This Dark Trade								FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				8						651304	10.3389/fvets.2021.651304				JUN 10 2021	2021	Little is known about the global bat souvenir trade despite previous research efforts into bat harvest for bushmeat. We screened eBay listings of bats in Australia, Canada, Italy, Switzerland, United Kingdom and USA to assess the nature and extent of the online offers. A total of 237 listings were retrieved in between the 11th and 25th of May 2020 with a median price per item of US$38.50 (range: US$8.50-2,500.00). Items on offer were mostly taxidermy (61.2%) or skull (21.1%) specimens. Overall, 32 different species of bat were advertised, most of which (n = 28) are listed as "Least Concern" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. One species (Nycteris javanica) is classified as "Vulnerable" and one (Eidolon helvum) as "Near Threatened." Pteropus spp. specimens were the most expensive specimens on offer and the conservations status of these species may range from "Critically Endangered" to "Data Deficient" by IUCN and the entire genus is listed in the Appendix II by the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). However, the exact species concerned, and their respective conservation status, could not be confirmed based on the listings' photos. The sourcing of bat was restricted to mostly South-East Asian countries (a third of items sourced from Indonesia) and to two African countries. Our survey revealed that the online offer of bat products is diverse, abundant, and facilitated by worldwide sellers although most offered bats species are from South-East Asia. With a few exceptions, the species on offer were of little present conservation concern, however, many unknowns remain on the potential animal welfare, biosecurity, legal implications, and most importantly public health risks associated with this dark trade.

COVID-19 poses a threat to human health around the world. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been confirmed as the pathogenic virus of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the beta-coronavirus family of viruses and is mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract. It has been proven that SARS-CoV-2 mainly targets angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) receptors on the surface of various cells in humans. The main clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Current evidence suggests that the damage caused by the virus may be closely related to the induction of cytokine storms in COVID-19. No specific drugs or measures have yet to be shown to cure COVID-19 completely. Cell-based approaches, primarily mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), have been identified to have anti-inflammatory and immune functions in COVID-19. Clinical studies about using MSCs and its derivatives-exosomes for COVID-19 treatment-are under investigation. Here, we review the current progress of the biological characteristics, clinical manifestations, and cell-based treatment development for COVID-19. Providing up-to-date information on COVID-19 and potential MSC therapies will help highlight routes to prevent and treat the disease.																					WOS:000665814700002	34211556

As most diseases emerge out of the human-animal interface, a better understanding of the specific drivers and mechanisms involved is crucial to prepare for future disease outbreaks. Interactions between wildlife and livestock systems contribute to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, especially in the face of globalization, habitat fragmentation and destruction and climate change. As several groups of viruses and bacteria are more likely to emerge, we focus on pathogenic viruses of the Bunyavirales, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae, as well as bacterial species including Mycobacterium sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus anthracis and Coxiella burnetii. Noteworthy, it was difficult to predict the drivers of disease emergence in the past, even for well-known pathogens. Thus, an improved surveillance in hotspot areas and the availability of fast, effective, and adaptable control measures would definitely contribute to preparedness. We here propose strategies to mitigate the risk of emergence and/or re-emergence of prioritized pathogens to prevent future epidemics. (C) 2021 The Authors.

As a primary receptor of SARS-CoV-2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) exists in different hosts that are in close contact with humans, especially cats and dogs. However, the underlying mechanism of how the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 cooperates with human ACE2 (hACE2), cat ACE2 (cACE2) and dog ACE2 (dACE2) and the variation in binding remains largely unsolved. Therefore, we explored the binding behavior of the spike RBD with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2 via all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. In accordance with the binding free energies and residue interactions, the spike RBD has respective binding specificities with cACE2, dACE2 and hACE2, and the binding affinities decrease in the order of hACE2, cACE2, dACE2, mainly due to changes in the amino acids Q24L, H34Y, and M82T in cACE2 or dACE2. Furthermore, alanine scanning analysis results validated some key residues of the spike RBD interact with ACE2 and provided clues to the variation of amino acid that could influence the transmissibility or immune responses of SARS-CoV-2. Decreasing dynamic correlations strengths of ACE2 with the RBD were found in all hACE2-RBD, cACE2-RBD and dACE2-RBD systems. The ACE2 protein shows variable motion modes across the zinc metallopeptidase domain, which induces different interactions between ACE2 and the RBD. Our studies reveal that the motion pattern of the zinc metallopeptidase domain is critical to the binding behavior of RBD with ACE2. These findings could aid our understanding of selective recognition involving various ACE2 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike and shed further light on the binding mechanisms.

No vaccines against RSV are currently in clinical use. Vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) caused by excess Th2 type responses was observed in a clinical trial of formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) in antigen-na & iuml;ve infants. Thus, inducing a balanced immune response is a crucial issue in the development of an RSV vaccine.Methods: In this study, we constructed, expressed, and purified a recombinant RSV vaccine candidate (i.e., HR & Oslash;24) containing the two heptad repeat regions and the antigenic sites & Oslash;, II, and IV of the RSV F protein. The RSV vaccine candidate was intranasally administrated to BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice in combination with virus-like particles (VLPs) derived from the core protein of the hepatitis B virus (HBc). Mucosal immunity to HR & Oslash;24 was then assessed. Results: Intranasal administration of HBc VLPs in combination with HR & Oslash;24 induced serum IgGs against HR & Oslash;24 as well as lung HR & Oslash;24-specific sIgAs in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mouse models. The secretion of IFN-c from splenocyte re-stimulation and an elevated ratio of serum IgG2a to IgG1 indicated that the immune response induced by the HBc VLPs/HR & Oslash;24 mixture was Th1-biased. Weight loss of <5% and no to low eosinophil infiltration was observed in histological analysis of the lung following a challenge with the RSV A2 strain. These results suggest that the HBc VLPs/HR & Oslash;24 combination conferred substantial partial protection against RSV-induced illness in mice. Conclusions: Long-term immunity to RSV-induced illness was achieved via intranasal vaccination using a mixture of HBc VLPs and HR & Oslash;24 in mouse models.

Mosquito-bite infection of humanized mice with chikungunya virus produces systemic disease with long-term effects								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				15	6					e0009427	10.1371/journal.pntd.0009427				JUN 2021	2021	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an emerging, mosquito-borne alphavirus responsible for acute to chronic arthralgias and neuropathies. Although it originated in central Africa, recent reports of disease have come from many parts of the world, including the Americas. While limiting human CHIKV cases through mosquito control has been used, it has not been entirely successful. There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments specific for CHIKV disease, thus more work is needed to develop effective countermeasures. Current animal research on CHIKV is often not representative of human disease. Most models use CHIKV needle inoculation via unnatural routes to create immediate viremia and localized clinical signs; these methods neglect the natural route of transmission (the mosquito vector bite) and the associated human immune response. Since mosquito saliva has been shown to have a profound effect on viral pathogenesis, we evaluated a novel model of infection that included the natural vector, Aedes species mosquitoes, transmitting CHIKV to mice containing components of the human immune system. Humanized mice infected by 3-6 mosquito bites showed signs of systemic infection, with demonstrable viremia (by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescent antibody assay), mild to moderate clinical signs (by observation, histology, and immunohistochemistry), and immune responses consistent with human infection (by flow cytometry and IgM ELISA). This model should give a better understanding of human CHIKV disease and allow for more realistic evaluations of mechanisms of pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatments.Author summary In humans, CHIKV infections are mostly symptomatic, resulting in fever, viremia, and debilitating joint disease; viremia is present up to 13 days after the onset of fever and peaks at the onset of clinical signs. Previous studies in mice and nonhuman primates (NHPs) have often neglected the mosquito vector, leading to variable viremias and infection of tissues primarily at the sites of CHIKV injection (legs in mice, ankles or spleen/liver in NHPs). This is the first study to demonstrate systemic CHIKV infection caused by infected mosquito bites in humanized laboratory mice. Disease seen with this humanized mouse model mimics human clinical signs and symptoms, with signs of inflammation in muscle and joints due to viral replication. This humanized mouse model provides a basis for assessing human CHIKV pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment, under natural conditions of infection.

From RNA World to SARS-CoV-2: The Edited Story of RNA Viral Evolution								CELLS				10	6					1557	10.3390/cells10061557				JUN 2021	2021	The current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underscores the importance of understanding the evolution of RNA genomes. While RNA is subject to the formation of similar lesions as DNA, the evolutionary and physiological impacts RNA lesions have on viral genomes are yet to be characterized. Lesions that may drive the evolution of RNA genomes can induce breaks that are repaired by recombination or can cause base substitution mutagenesis, also known as base editing. Over the past decade or so, base editing mutagenesis of DNA genomes has been subject to many studies, revealing that exposure of ssDNA is subject to hypermutation that is involved in the etiology of cancer. However, base editing of RNA genomes has not been studied to the same extent. Recently hypermutation of single-stranded RNA viral genomes have also been documented though its role in evolution and population dynamics. Here, we will summarize the current knowledge of key mechanisms and causes of RNA genome instability covering areas from the RNA world theory to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic of today. We will also highlight the key questions that remain as it pertains to RNA genome instability, mutations accumulation, and experimental strategies for addressing these questions.

The susceptibility of experimentally infected pets, such as dogs, ferrets and cats, has been described in the recent bibliography; furthermore, the exposure of pets (dogs and cats) to SARS-CoV-2-infected owners under natural conditions was also reported. Most of the cats infected or exposed to SARS-CoV-2 were reported to be mildly symptomatic, while no study has described the clinical features and diagnostic management of symptomatic cats. This work reports the case of an indoor cat that developed clinical signs of disease after being in contact with SARS-CoV-2-infected owners and focuses on the importance of implementing a multisectoral One Health approach. Even though the viral shedding from pets does not appear sufficient to infect family members or other animals, the usual precautionary measures should urgently be considered as part of a global control system, as this integrated approach encompassing both humans and pets is pivotal for the early detection of any possible viral mutation. Despite the reported increase in SARS-CoV-2-infected pets, the description of the clinical features from natural infection and the medical follow up in symptomatic pets is still not sufficiently documented. This study reports the case of an indoor cat that displayed respiratory signs and a gastrointestinal syndrome, following the COVID-19 diagnosis of his owners. Thoracic radiographies were suggestive of bronchial pneumonia, while blood tests were indicative of a mild inflammatory process. Nasal and oropharyngeal swabs tested positive through RT-qPCR assays targeting SARS-CoV-2 genes 14 days after his owners tested positive for the virus. Nasal swabs persisted to be RT-qPCR positive after 31 days. Serology confirmed the presence of antibodies through ELISA, electrochemiluminescence analysis and plaque reduction neutralization test, recording a high antibody titre after 31 days. The cat improved after medical treatment and clinically recovered. This study suggests that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 could lead to a natural infection with bronchial pneumonia in cats along with a possible prolonged persistence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper airways, albeit at a low level. The cat developed neutralizing antibodies, reaching a high titre after 31 days. Further descriptions of SARS-CoV-2 naturally infected pets, their medical management and diagnostic findings would be useful to enhance knowledge about COVID-19 in susceptible animals.

Results of in-vivo, in-vitro and field studies suggested that amphibians and reptiles may play a role as reservoir hosts of RVFV, promoting its maintenance during inter-epidemic periods. To elucidate this hypothesis, we examined two newly established reptile-derived cell lines (Egyptian cobra and Chinese pond turtle) and five previously generated reptile- and amphibian-derived cell lines for their replicative capacity for three low- and high-pathogenic RVFV strains. At different time points after infection, viral loads (TCID50), genome loads and the presence of intracellular viral antigen (immunofluorescence) were assessed. Additionally, the influence of temperatures on the replication was examined. Except for one cell line (read-eared slider), all seven cell lines were infected by all three RVFV strains. Two different terrapin-derived cell lines (Common box turtle, Chinese pond turtle) were highly susceptible. A temperature-dependent replication of RVFV was detected for both amphibian and reptile cells. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate the general permissiveness of amphibian and reptile cell lines to RVFV and propose a potential involvement of terrapins in the virus ecology.

Vampire bat feeding habits enable their contact with mammalian hosts and may enhance zoonotic spillover. Moreover, they may carry several pathogenic organisms, including coronaviruses (CoVs), for which they are important hosts. The human pathogens that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and possibly coronavirus disease 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) all originated in bats but required bridge hosts to spread into human populations. To monitor the presence of potential zoonotic viruses in bats, the present work evaluated the presence of CoVs in vampire bats from southern Brazil. A total of 101 vampire bats were captured and euthanized between 2017 and 2019 in Rio Grande do Sul state, southern Brazil. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys and intestines were collected and macerated individually. The samples were pooled and submitted to high-throughput sequencing (HTS) using the Illumina MiSeq platform and subsequently individually screened using a pancoronavirus RT-PCR protocol. We detected CoV-related sequences in HTS, but only two (2/101; 1.98%) animals had CoV detected in the intestines by RT-PCR. Partial sequences of RdRp and spike genes were obtained in the same sample and the RdRp region in the other sample. The sequences were classified as belonging to Alphacoronavirus. The sequences were closely related to alphacoronaviruses detected in vampire bats from Peru. The continuous monitoring of bat CoVs may help to map and predict putative future zoonotic agents with great impacts on human health.																					WOS:000655690200001	33977671

Fifty-nine cases were evaluated during an 11-year period (2008-2019), including representatives from four families: Pteropodidae (Yinpterochiroptera), Phyllostomidae, Vespertilionidae and Molossidae (Yangochiroptera). Pathology reports were reviewed to determine the primary pathological process resulting in death or the decision to euthanize. Cases were categorized as non-infectious (34/59; 58%), infectious/inflammatory (17/59; 29%) or undetermined due to advanced autolysis (8/59; 14%). Musculoskeletal diseases and reproductive losses were the most frequent pathological processes. Among the infectious processes identified, bacterial infections of the reproductive and haemolymphatic systems were most frequently observed. The first two reports of neoplasia in small flying foxes (Pteropus hypomelanus) are described. Bats under managed care present with a wide range of histopathological lesions. In this cohort, non-infectious disease processes were common. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000660063500012	34119238

Old vaccines for new infections: Exploiting innate immunity to control COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				118	21					e2101718118	10.1073/pnas.2101718118				MAY 25 2021	2021	The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unparalleled pursuit of vaccines to induce specific adaptive immunity, based on virus-neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses. Although several vaccines have been developed just a year after SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019, global deployment will take months or even years. Meanwhile, the virus continues to take a severe toll on human life and exact substantial economic costs. Innate immunity is fundamental to mammalian host defense capacity to combat infections. Innate immune responses, triggered by a family of pattern recognition receptors, induce interferons and other cytokines and activate both myeloid and lymphoid immune cells to provide protection against a wide range of pathogens. Epidemiological and biological evidence suggests that the live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) targeting tuberculosis, measles, and polio induce protective innate immunity by a newly described form of immunological memory termed "trained immunity." An LAV designed to induce adaptive immunity targeting a particular pathogen may also induce innate immunity that mitigates other infectious diseases, including COVID-19, as well as future pandemic threats. Deployment of existing LAVs early in pandemics could complement the development of specific vaccines, bridging the protection gap until specific vaccines arrive. The broad protection induced by LAVs would not be compromised by potential antigenic drift (immune escape) that can render viruses resistant to specific vaccines. LAVs might offer an essential tool to "bend the pandemic curve," averting the exhaustion of public health resources and preventing needless deaths and may also have therapeutic benefits if used for postexposure prophylaxis of disease.

Health monitoring in birds using bio-loggers and whole blood transcriptomics								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					10815	10.1038/s41598-021-90212-8				MAY 24 2021	2021	Monitoring and early detection of emerging infectious diseases in wild animals is of crucial global importance, yet reliable ways to measure immune status and responses are lacking for animals in the wild. Here we assess the usefulness of bio-loggers for detecting disease outbreaks in free-living birds and confirm detailed responses using leukocyte composition and large-scale transcriptomics. We simulated natural infections by viral and bacterial pathogens in captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), an important natural vector for avian influenza virus. We show that body temperature, heart rate and leukocyte composition change reliably during an acute phase immune response. Using genome-wide gene expression profiling of whole blood across time points we confirm that immunostimulants activate pathogen-specific gene regulatory networks. By reporting immune response related changes in physiological and behavioural traits that can be studied in free-ranging populations, we provide baseline information with importance to the global monitoring of zoonotic diseases.

The role of syncytia during viral infections								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY				525						110749	10.1016/j.jtbi.2021.110749		MAY 2021		SEP 2021	2021	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common, contagious infection of the lungs and the respiratory tract. RSV is characterized by syncytia, which are multinuclear cells created by cells that have fused together. We use a mathematical model to study how different assumptions about the viral production and lifespan of syncytia change the resulting infection time course. We find that the effect of syncytia on viral titer is only apparent when the basic reproduction number for infection via syncytia formation is similar to the reproduction number for cell free viral transmission. When syncytia fusion rate is high, we find the presence of syncytia can lead to slowly growing infections if viral production is suppressed in syncytia. Our model provides insight into how the presence of syncytia can affect the time course of a viral infection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evolution, Ecology, and Zoonotic Transmission of Betacoronaviruses: A Review								FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				8						644414	10.3389/fvets.2021.644414				MAY 20 2021	2021	Coronavirus infections have been a part of the animal kingdom for millennia. The difference emerging in the twenty-first century is that a greater number of novel coronaviruses are being discovered primarily due to more advanced technology and that a greater number can be transmitted to humans, either directly or via an intermediate host. This has a range of effects from annual infections that are mild to full-blown pandemics. This review compares the zoonotic potential and relationship between MERS, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. The role of bats as possible host species and possible intermediate hosts including pangolins, civets, mink, birds, and other mammals are discussed with reference to mutations of the viral genome affecting zoonosis. Ecological, social, cultural, and environmental factors that may play a role in zoonotic transmission are considered with reference to SARS-CoV, MERS, and SARS-CoV-2 and possible future zoonotic events.

Similar to that in SARS-CoV, the entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is ACE2. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 is the critical to the virus infection. Recently multiple species (human, Chinese chrysanthemum, Malay pangolin and cat) have been reported to be susceptible to the virus infection. However, the binding capacity and the detailed binding mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 of these species remains unexplored. Herein free energy calculations with MM-GBSA and Potential of Mean Forces together reveal that the Human-SARS-CoV-2 has a higher stability tendency than Human-SARS-CoV. Meanwhile, we uncover that SARS-CoV-2 has an enhanced ability to bind with the ACE2 in humans, pangolins and cats compared to that in bats. Analysis of key residues with energy decomposition and residue contact maps reveal several important consensus sites in ACE2s among the studied species, and determined the more favorable specified residues among the different types of amino acids. These results provide important implications for understanding SARS-CoV-2 host range which will make it possible to control the spread of the virus and use of animal models, targeted drug screening and vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV2.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. and Societe Francaise de Biochimie et Biologie Moleculaire (SFBBM).

This is primarily attributed to the exaggerated immune response (inflammatory disease), which may prove detrimental to the host, as evidenced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. From the experiences of Novel Coronavirus Disease-19 to date, male patients are likely to suffer from high-intensity inflammation and disease severity than the female population. Hormones are considered the significant pillars of sex differences responsible for the discrepancy in immune response exhibited by males and females. Females appear to be better equipped to counter invading respiratory viral pathogens, including the novel SARS-CoV-2, than males. It can be hypothesized that females are more shielded from disease severity, probably owing to the diverse action/influence of estrogen and other sex hormones on both cellular (thymus-derived T lymphocytes) and humoral immunity (antibodies).

Limited cross-species transmission and absence of mutations associated with SARS-CoV-2 adaptation in cats: A case study of infection in a small household setting								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				69	3			1606	1616		10.1111/tbed.14132		MAY 2021		MAY 2022	2022	In the present study, the course of SARS-CoV-2 natural infection in two asymptomatic cats, which were negative for immunosuppressive retroviral infections, is investigated. The source of the virus for the cats was their COVID-19-affected owner, with whom they were in continuous proximity in a small household setting. The owner's signs included fatigue, sneezing, anosmia and loss of taste, and diagnosis was confirmed 4 days after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal and faecal swabs were collected from the cats, to investigate the course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, as well as the directionality of the chain of virus transmission. Both infected cats were real-time RT-PCR-positive on various time-points. Pharyngeal shedding of at least 6 days was observed in them, with high SARS-CoV-2 titres (> 7 Log(10) copies/swab) on the first sampling time-point, that is, 7 days after the onset of owner's clinical signs. In one cat, after the initial decline, slightly increasing virus titres were measured 3 to 6 days after the first real-time RT-PCR-positive swab. Serological testing of this cat revealed absence of seroconversion. The course of viral RNA concentrations in the faecal swabs of the other cat was similar to that in its pharynx. The detected SARS-CoV-2 strains, from both infected cats and their owner, underwent whole-genome sequencing, revealing the absence of emergence of cross-species adaptive mutations in cats. The results support the notion that human SARS-CoV-2 strains are relatively well-adapted to cats. It is still unclear whether asymptomatic animals could play a role in COVID-19 epidemiology, in case of interaction with naive animals and/or people. Our findings highlight difficulties in SARS-CoV-2 transmission to cats, as neither the two infected cats nor their owner was able to transmit the virus to a third cat living in the same small flat, despite their very close contact during the days corresponding to high virus shedding.

Despite the substantial efforts, only few vaccines are currently approved and some are in the different stages of clinical trials. As the disease rapidly spreads, an affordable and effective vaccine is urgently needed. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity of plant-produced receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 in order to use as a subunit vaccine. In this regard, RBD of SARS-CoV-2 was fused with Fc fragment of human IgG1 and transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana by agroinfiltration. The plant-produced RBD-Fc fusion protein was purified from the crude extract by using protein A affinity column chromatography. Two intramuscular administration of plant-produced RBD-Fc protein formulated with alum as an adjuvant have elicited high neutralization titers in immunized mice and cynomolgus monkeys. Further it has induced a mixed Th1/Th2 immune responses and vaccine-specific T-lymphocyte responses which was confirmed by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunospot assay. Altogether, our results demonstrated that the plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD has the potential to be used as an effective vaccine candidate against SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the immunogenicity of plant-produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein in mice and non-human primates.																					WOS:000655174800001	34054909

Aim: We analysed human WNV infections reported between 2010 and 2018 to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to better understand WNV epidemiology. Methods: We describe probable and confirmed autochthonous human cases of WNV infection reported by European Union (EU) and EU enlargement countries. Cases with unknown clinical manifestation or with unknown place of infection at NUTS 3 or GAUL 1 level were excluded from analysis. Results: From southern, eastern and western Europe, 3,849 WNV human infections and 379 deaths were reported. Most cases occurred between June and October. Two large outbreaks occurred, in 2010 (n = 391) and in 2018 (n = 1,993). The outbreak in 2018 was larger than in all previous years and the first cases were reported unusually early. The number of newly affected areas (n = 45) was higher in 2018 than in previous years suggesting wider spread of WNV. Conclusion: Real-time surveillance of WNV infections is key to ensuring that clinicians and public health authorities receive early warning about the occurrence of cases and potential unusual seasonal patterns. Human cases may appear shortly after first detection of animal cases. Therefore, public health authorities should develop preparedness plans before the occur-rence of human or animal WNV infections.																					WOS:000651622700002	33988124

The most important and challenging problem here is to design an effective and robust diagnosis model. To this end, there are three challenges to overcome: (1) The lack of training samples limits the success of existing deep-learning-based methods. (2) Many public COVID-19 data sets contain only a few images without fine-grained labels. (3) Due to the explosive growth of suspected cases, it is urgent and important to diagnose not only COVID-19 cases but also the cases of other types of pneumonia that are similar to the symptoms of COVID-19. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Unsupervised Meta-Learning with Self-Knowledge Distillation to address the problem of differentiating COVID-19 from pneumonia cases. During training, our model cannot use any true labels and aims to gain the ability of learning to learn by itself. In particular, we first present a deep diagnosis model based on a relation network to capture and memorize the relation among different images. Second, to enhance the performance of our model, we design a self-knowledge distillation mechanism that distills knowledge within our model itself. Our network is divided into several parts, and the knowledge in the deeper parts is squeezed into the shallow ones. The final results are derived from our model by learning to compare the features of images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher performance than other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we construct a new COVID-19 pneumonia data set based on text mining, consisting of 2696 COVID-19 images (347 X-ray + 2349 CT), 10,155 images (9661 X-ray + 494 CT) about other types of pneumonia, and the fine-grained labels of all. Our data set considers not only a bacterial infection or viral infection which causes pneumonia but also a viral infection derived from the influenza virus or coronavirus.

Black rats (Rattus rattus) as potential reservoir hosts for Rift Valley fever phlebovirus: Experimental infection results in viral replication and shedding without clinical manifestation								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				69	3			1307	1318		10.1111/tbed.14093		MAY 2021		MAY 2022	2022	Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that can cause severe disease in ruminants and humans. Epidemics occur mainly after heavy rainfall, which leads to a significant increase in the occurrence of RVFV-transmitting mosquitoes. During inter-epidemic periods, the virus is assumed to be maintained between mosquitoes, susceptible livestock and yet unknown wildlife. The widespread rodent Rattus rattus (black rat) has been suspected to be involved in RVFV maintenance. In order to elucidate its susceptibility and thus its possible role in the transmission cycle of the virus, an experimental infection study was performed. Black rats were subcutaneously infected with highly virulent RVFV strain 35/74 and euthanized on days 3, 14 and 28 post-infection. Additional black rats served as non-infected contact animals. The infected black rats showed high susceptibility to RVFV infection. Generation of RVFV-neutralizing antibodies was found, and the rats developed viraemias lasting up to 17 days. Viral RNA was found in tissues until the last day of the experiment. However, neither a clinical manifestation nor virus-induced histopathological lesions were observed in any rat. These findings indicate the persistence of RVFV in black rats without affecting the animals. In contact animals, no evidence of horizontal RVFV transmission was found, although the co-housed infected rats showed oral, rectal and conjunctival RVFV shedding. Results of this study point to an involvement of black rats in the RVFV transmission cycle, and further studies are needed to investigate their potential role in the maintenance of the virus.

It is an emerging infectious disease, probably of animal origin. Several domesticated and non-domesticated animals are naturally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including Mustelidae, of which mink is the first species identified to suffer from this infection. We report herein the detection of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in lymph node tissue from two feral American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the wild in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain) during invasive species trapping campaigns.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causal agent of COVID-19, is considered a pathogen of animal origin that is mainly transmitted from human to human. Several animal species can be naturally or experimentally infected by SARS-CoV-2, with compelling evidence that mink is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Human-to-mink infection cases have been reported and there are also suggestions that mink-to-human infection occurs. Mink infections have been reported to date only on fur farms, except for one infected free- ranging wild mink near a Utah (USA) fur farm, which suggests a transmission pathway from farms to wild mink. We now report the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 2 of 13 feral dark brown American mink (Neovison vison) trapped in the Valencian Community (Eastern Spain), during an invasive species trapping campaign. They were trapped in riverbeds in sparsely inhabited rural areas known to harbor self-sustained feral mink populations. The closest fur farm is about 20 km away. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected by two-step RT-PCR in these animals' mesenteric lymph nodes and was confirmed by sequencing a 397-nucleotide amplified region of the S gene, yielding identical sequences in both animals. A molecular phylogenetic analysis was run on this sequence, which was found to correspond to the consensus SARS-CoV-2 sequence from Wuhan.

Bats can be found in almost all global habitats with the notable exception of the high arctic and a few isolated oceanic islands. First, we give an overview on the potential role of bats as carriers of zoonotic viruses, underlining the relevance of specific physiological traits of representatives of this mammalian order, that are supporting the transmission of these disease agents. Research in this field was predominantly initiated by the SARS coronavirus event in 2003, and in the meantime, bats are assumed to be the ancestor hosts for numerous alpha and beta coronaviruses. Bat associated coronaviruses have been detected on all continents where bats are distributed. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, coronavirus research has again been considerably intensified, leading to a gain of knowledge regarding the interaction between bats and coronaviruses that will be valuable in the management of potential future outbreaks originating from bats. Finally, an outlook is given on research gaps that could be invaluable when dealing with future pandemic events.																					WOS:000777547800001

A Sensitive and Specific Competitive Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for Serodiagnosis of COVID-19 in Animals								MICROORGANISMS				9	5					1019	10.3390/microorganisms9051019				MAY 2021	2021	In addition to human cases, cases of COVID-19 in captive animals and pets are increasingly reported. This raises the concern for two-way COVID-19 transmission between humans and animals. Here, we developed a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein-based competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for serodiagnosis of COVID-19 which can theoretically be used in virtually all kinds of animals. We used 187 serum samples from patients with/without COVID-19, laboratory animals immunized with inactive SARS-CoV-2 virions, COVID-19-negative animals, and animals seropositive to other betacoronaviruses. A cut-off percent inhibition value of 22.345% was determined and the analytical sensitivity and specificity were found to be 1:64-1:256 and 93.9%, respectively. Evaluation on its diagnostic performance using 155 serum samples from COVID-19-negative animals and COVID-19 human patients showed a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 80.8% and 100%, respectively. The cELISA can be incorporated into routine blood testing of farmed/captive animals for COVID-19 surveillance.																					WOS:000662343000001	34068581

Persistent Airway Hyperresponsiveness Following Recovery from Infection with Pneumonia Virus of Mice								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	5					728	10.3390/v13050728				MAY 2021	2021	Respiratory virus infections can have long-term effects on lung function that persist even after the acute responses have resolved. Numerous studies have linked severe early childhood infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) to the development of wheezing and asthma, although the underlying mechanisms connecting these observations remain unclear. Here, we examine airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) that develops in wild-type mice after recovery from symptomatic but sublethal infection with the natural rodent pathogen, pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). We found that BALB/c mice respond to a limited inoculum of PVM with significant but reversible weight loss accompanied by virus replication, acute inflammation, and neutrophil recruitment to the airways. At day 21 post-inoculation, virus was no longer detected in the airways and the acute inflammatory response had largely resolved. However, and in contrast to most earlier studies using the PVM infection model, all mice survived the initial infection and all went on to develop serum anti-PVM IgG antibodies. Furthermore, using both invasive plethysmography and precision-cut lung slices, we found that these mice exhibited significant airway hyperresponsiveness at day 21 post-inoculation that persisted through day 45. Taken together, our findings extend an important and versatile respiratory virus infection model that can now be used to explore the role of virions and virion clearance as well as virus-induced inflammatory mediators and their signaling pathways in the development and persistence of post-viral AHR and lung dysfunction.

It remains largely unknown how plasma virus composition changes during HIV-1 infection and antiretroviral therapy (ART). We performed viral metagenomic analysis on viral particles enriched from human plasma from 101 men who have sex with men (MSM) with or without HIV-1 infection and whether or not on ART and compared the differences in the plasma virome. An increased plasma viral abundance of main eukaryotic viruses was observed during HIV-1 infection in MSM, especially in AIDS patients (CD4(+) T cell counts of <200). Anellovirus, pegivirus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) were the most abundant blood-borne viruses detected among MSM and HIV-1-infected individuals, and anellovirus and pegivirus were closely related to HIV-1 infection. High diversity of anelloviruses was found mostly in HIV-1-infected MSM, and their abundance was positively correlated with the HIV-1 viral load, but negatively correlated with both CD4(+) T cell counts and CD4(+)/CD8(+) ratio; in contrast, the abundance of pegivirus showed opposite correlations. ART usage could restore the plasma virome toward that of HIV-1-negative individuals. These data showed an expansion in abundance of certain viruses during HIV-1 infection, indicating the higher risk of shedding some blood-borne viruses in these individuals. These investigations indicate that both anellovirus and pegivirus may play certain roles in HIV disease progression.IMPORTANCE Though an increasing number of studies have indicated the existence of an interaction between the virome and human health or disease, the specific role of these plasma viral components remains largely unsolved. We provide evidence here that an altered plasma virome profile is associated with different immune status of HIV-1 infection. Specific resident viruses, such as anellovirus and pegivirus, may directly or indirectly participate in the disease progression of HIV-1 infection. These results can help to determine their clinical relevance and design potential therapies.																					WOS:000663083400007	33952659

Much information about the interplay between viruses and cell proliferation and metabolism has come from the history of clinical cases of patients infected with virus-induced cancer. In addition, information from viruses used to treat some types of cancer is valuable. Now, since the global coronavirus pandemic erupted almost a year ago, the scientific community has invested countless time and resources to slow down the infection rate and diminish the number of casualties produced by this highly infectious pathogen. A large percentage of cancer cases diagnosed are strongly related to dysregulations of the tyrosine kinase receptor (TKR) family and its downstream signaling pathways. As such, many therapeutic agents have been developed to strategically target these structures in order to hinder certain mechanisms pertaining to the phenotypic characteristics of cancer cells such as division, invasion or metastatic potential. Interestingly, several authors have pointed out that a correlation between coronaviruses such as the SARS-CoV-1 and -2 or MERS viruses and dysregulations of signaling pathways activated by TKRs can be established. This information may help to accelerate the repurposing of clinically developed anti-TKR cancer drugs in COVID-19 management. Because the need for treatment is critical, drug repurposing may be an advantageous choice in the search for new and efficient therapeutic compounds. This approach would be advantageous from a financial point of view as well, given that the resources used for research and development would no longer be required and can be potentially redirected towards other key projects. This review aims to provide an overview of how SARS-CoV-2 interacts with different TKRs and their respective downstream signaling pathway and how several therapeutic agents targeted against these receptors can interfere with the viral infection. Additionally, this review aims to identify if SARS-CoV-2 can be repurposed to be a potential viral vector against different cancer types.																					WOS:000650358400001	34063231	
J	Reyes Zamora, J. Lizbeth; Ortega, Victoria; Johnston, Gunner P.; Li, Jenny; Aguilar, Hector C.								Novel Roles of the N1 Loop and N4 Alpha-Helical Region of the Nipah Virus Fusion Glycoprotein in Modulating Early and Late Steps of the Membrane Fusion Cascade								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				95	9					e01707-20	10.1128/JVI.01707-20				MAY 2021	2021	Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic bat henipavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. NiV is deadly to humans, infecting host cells by direct fusion of the viral and host cell plasma membranes. This membrane fusion process is coordinated by the receptor binding attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. Upon G-receptor binding, F fuses membranes via a cascade that sequentially involves F-triggering, fusion pore formation, and viral or genome entry into cells. Using NiV as an important paramyxoviral model, we identified two novel regions in F that modulate the membrane fusion cascade. For paramyxoviruses and other viral families with class I fusion proteins, the heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2 regions in the fusion protein prefusion conformation bind to form a six-helix bundle in the postfusion conformation. Here, structural comparisons between the F prefusion and postfusion conformations revealed that a short loop region (N1) undergoes dramatic spatial reorganization and a short alpha helix (N4) undergoes secondary structural changes. The roles of the N1 and N4 regions during the membrane fusion cascade, however, remain unknown for henipaviruses and paramyxoviruses. By performing alanine scanning mutagenesis and various functional analyses, we report that specific residues within these regions alter various steps in the membrane fusion cascade. While the N1 region affects early F-triggering, the N4 region affects F-triggering, F thermostability, and extensive fusion pore expansion during syncytium formation, also uncovering a link between F-G interactions and F -triggering. These novel mechanistic roles expand our understanding of henipaviral and paramyxoviral F-triggering, viral entry, and cell-cell fusion (syncytia), a pathognomonic feature of paramyxoviral infections.IMPORTANCE Henipaviruses infect bats, agriculturally important animals, and humans, with high mortality rates approaching ;75% in humans. Known human outbreaks have been concentrated in Southeast Asia and Australia. Furthermore, about 20 new henipaviral species have been recently discovered in bats, with geographical spans in Asia, Africa, and South America. The development of antiviral therapeutics requires a thorough understanding of the mechanism of viral entry into host cells. In this study, we discovered novel roles of two regions within the fusion protein of the deadly henipavirus NiV. Such roles were in allowing viral entry into host cells and cell-cell fusion, a pathological hallmark of this and other paramyxoviruses. These novel roles were in the previously undescribed N1 and N4 regions within the fusion protein, modulating early and late steps of these important processes of viral infection and henipaviral disease. Notably, this knowledge may apply to other henipaviruses and more broadly to other paramyxoviruses.																					WOS:000640382100008	33568505	
J	Sotomayor-Bonilla, Jesus; Del Callejo-Canal, Enrique; Gonzalez-Salazar, Constantino; Suzan, Gerardo; Stephens, Christopher R.								Using Data Mining and Network Analysis to Infer Arboviral Dynamics: The Case of Mosquito-Borne Flaviviruses Reported in Mexico								INSECTS				12	5					398	10.3390/insects12050398				MAY 2021	2021	Simple SummaryGiven the significant impact on both human and animal health of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, a better understanding of their transmission cycles, viewed as a complex multi pathogen-vector-host system is urgently required. Here, we use a spatial datamining framework, based on co-occurrence data that includes biotic niche variables to create models for Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile Virus and St. Louis encephalitis in Mexico that predict: (i) which mosquito species are likely to be the most important vectors for a given pathogen; (ii) which species are most likely to be important from a multi-pathogenic viewpoint; and (iii) which mosquito and/or mammal assemblages are most likely to play an important role in the transmission cycles. Our predictions are consistent with known information about the dynamics of these mosquito-borne flaviviruses and predict new potential vectors. Our approach can improve disease surveillance efforts and generate useful information regarding public health and biodiversity conservation.Given the significant impact of mosquito-borne flaviviruses (MBFVs) on both human and animal health, predicting their dynamics and understanding their transmission cycle is of the utmost importance. Usually, predictions about the distribution of priority pathogens, such as Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile Virus and St. Louis encephalitis, relate abiotic elements to simple biotic components, such as a single causal agent. Furthermore, focusing on single pathogens neglects the possibility of interactions and the existence of common elements in the transmission cycles of multiple pathogens. A necessary, but not sufficient, condition that a mosquito be a vector of a MBFV is that it co-occurs with hosts of the pathogen. We therefore use a recently developed modeling framework, based on co-occurrence data, to infer potential biotic interactions between those mosquito and mammal species which have previously been identified as vectors or confirmed positives of at least one of the considered MBFVs. We thus create models for predicting the relative importance of mosquito species as potential vectors for each pathogen, and also for all pathogens together, using the known vectors to validate the models. We infer that various mosquito species are likely to be significant vectors, even though they have not currently been identified as such, and are likely to harbor multiple pathogens, again validating the predictions with known results. Besides the above "niche-based" viewpoint we also consider an assemblage-based analysis, wherein we use a community-identification algorithm to identify those mosquito and/or mammal species that form assemblages by dint of their significant degree of co-occurrence. The most cohesive assemblage includes important primary vectors, such as A. aegypti, A. albopictus, C. quinquefasciatus, C. pipiens and mammals with abundant populations that are well-adapted to human environments, such as the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), peccary (Tayassu pecari), opossum (Didelphis marsupialis) and bats (Artibeus lituratus and Sturnira lilium). Our results suggest that this assemblage has an important role in the transmission dynamics of this viral group viewed as a complex multi-pathogen-vector-host system. By including biotic risk factors our approach also modifies the geographical risk profiles of the spatial distribution of MBFVs in Mexico relative to a consideration of only abiotic niche variables.

We evaluated cell lines commonly used to isolate viruses and diagnose related diseases for their susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Although multiple kidney cell lines from monkeys were susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, we found many cell types derived from humans, dogs, minks, cats, mice, and chicken were not. We analyzed MDCK cells, which are most commonly used for surveillance and study of influenza viruses, and found that they were not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. The low expression level of the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor and lower receptor affinity to SARS-CoV-2 spike, which could be overcome by overexpression of canine angiotensin converting enzyme 2 in trans, strengthened the cellular barrier to productive infection. Moreover, a D614G mutation in the spike protein did not appear to affect SARS-CoV-2 cell tropism. Our findings should help avert inadvertent propagation of SARS-CoV-2 from diagnostic cell lines.																					WOS:000650121700016	33900165

Since the very beginning, the spread of the virus has been tracked nearly in real-time by worldwide genome sequencing efforts. As of March 2021, more than 830,000 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been uploaded in GISAID and this wealth of data allowed researchers to study the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during this first pandemic year. In parallel, nomenclatures systems, often with poor consistency among each other, have been developed to designate emerging viral lineages. Despite general fears that the virus might mutate to become more virulent or transmissible, SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity has remained relatively low during the first similar to 8 months of sustained human-to-human transmission. At the end of 2020/beginning of 2021, though, some alarming events started to raise concerns of possible changes in the evolutionary trajectory of the virus. Specifically, three new viral variants associated with extensive transmission have been described as variants of concern (VOC). These variants were first reported in the UK (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P.1). Their designation as VOCs was determined by an increase of local cases and by the high number of amino acid substitutions harboured by these lineages. This latter feature is reminiscent of viral sequences isolated from immunocompromised patients with long-term infection, suggesting a possible causal link. Here we review the events that led to the identification of these lineages, as well as emerging data concerning their possible implications for viral phenotypes, reinfection risk, vaccine efficiency and epidemic potential. Most of the available evidence is, to date, provisional, but still represents a starting point to uncover the potential threat posed by the VOCs. We also stress that genomic surveillance must be strengthened, especially in the wake of the vaccination campaigns.																					WOS:000733831600003		
J	Sapula, Sylvia A.; Whittall, Jonathan J.; Pandopulos, Aaron J.; Gerber, Cobus; Venter, Henrietta								An optimized and robust PEG precipitation method for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				785						147270	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147270		APR 2021		SEP 1 2021	2021	Wastewater-based epidemiology is currently being utilized to monitor the dissemination of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on a population scale. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater is highly influenced by methodologies used for its isolation, concentration and RNA extraction. Although various viral concentration methods are currently employed, including polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation, adsorption-extraction, ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration, to our knowledge, none of these methods have been standardized for use with a variety of wastewater matrices and/or different kits for RNA extraction and quantification. To address this, wastewater with different physical characteristics was seeded with gamma-irradiated SARS-CoV-2 and used to test the efficiency of PEG precipitation and adsorption-extraction to concentrate the virus from three physiochemically different wastewater samples, sourced from three distinct wastewater plants. Efficiency of viral concentration and RNA extraction was assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and the recovery yields calculated. As co-purification of inhibitors can be problematic for subsequent detection, two commonly used commercial master mixes were assessed for their sensitivity and efficiency to detect two SARS-CoV-2 target nucleocapsid (N) gene sequences. Recovery rates varied greatly between wastewater matrices and concentration methods, with the highest and most reproducible recovery rates (46.6-56.7%) observed when SARS-CoV-2 was precipitated with PEG and detected by the Luna (R) Universal master mix. The adsorption-extraction method was less effective (0-21.7%). This study demonstrates that PEG precipitation is the more robust method, which translates well to varying wastewater matrices, producing consistent and reproducible recovery rates. Furthermore, it is compatible with different kits for RNA extraction and quantitation. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000659457100008	33940413

There are no licensed therapeutics or vaccines to protect humans. HeV and NiV use a receptor-binding glycoprotein (G) and a fusion glycoprotein (F) to enter host cells. HNV F and G are the main targets of the humoral immune response, and the presence of neutralizing antibodies is a correlate of protection against NiV and HeV in experimentally infected animals. We describe here two cross-reactive F-specific antibodies, 1F5 and 12B2, that neutralize NiV and HeV through inhibition of membrane fusion. Cryo-electron microscopy structures reveal that 1F5 and 12B2 recognize distinct prefusion-specific, conserved quaternary epitopes and lock F in its prefusion conformation. We provide proof-of-concept for using antibody cocktails for neutralizing NiV and HeV and define a roadmap for developing effective countermeasures against these highly pathogenic viruses.Structural and functional characterization of two neutralizing antibodies that target conserved, nonoverlapping epitopes in HeV and NiV F protein trimers and inhibit membrane fusion establishes the therapeutic potential of antibody cocktails to protect against henipavirus infection.

J	Keesing, Felicia; Ostfeld, Richard S.								Impacts of biodiversity and biodiversity loss on zoonotic diseases								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				118	17					e2023540118	10.1073/pnas.2023540118				APR 27 2021	2021	Zoonotic diseases are infectious diseases of humans caused by pathogens that are shared between humans and other vertebrate animals. Previously, pristine natural areas with high biodiversity were seen as likely sources of new zoonotic pathogens, suggesting that biodiversity could have negative impacts on human health. At the same time, biodiversity has been recognized as potentially benefiting human health by reducing the transmission of some pathogens that have already established themselves in human populations. These apparently opposing effects of biodiversity in human health may now be reconcilable. Recent research demonstrates that some taxa are much more likely to be zoonotic hosts than others are, and that these animals often proliferate in human-dominated landscapes, increasing the likelihood of spillover. In less-disturbed areas, however, these zoonotic reservoir hosts are less abundant and nonreservoirs predominate. Thus, biodiversity loss appears to increase the risk of human exposure to both new and established zoonotic pathogens. This new synthesis of the effects of biodiversity on zoonotic diseases presents an opportunity to articulate the next generation of research questions that can inform management and policy. Future studies should focus on collecting and analyzing data on the diversity, abundance, and capacity to transmit of the taxa that actually share zoonotic pathogens with us. To predict and prevent future epidemics, researchers should also focus on how these metrics change in response to human impacts on the environment, and how human behaviors can mitigate these effects. Restoration of biodiversity is an important frontier in the management of zoonotic disease risk.																					WOS:000648438500016	33820825

A Recombinant BCG Vaccine Is Safe and Immunogenic in Neonatal Calves and Reduces the Clinical Disease Caused by the Respiratory Syncytial Virus								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				12						664212	10.3389/fimmu.2021.664212				APR 26 2021	2021	The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) constitutes a major health burden, causing millions of hospitalizations in children under five years old worldwide due to acute lower respiratory tract infections. Despite decades of research, licensed vaccines to prevent hRSV are not available. Development of vaccines against hRSV targeting young infants requires ruling out potential vaccine-enhanced disease presentations. To achieve this goal, vaccine testing in proper animal models is essential. A recombinant BCG vaccine that expresses the Nucleoprotein of hRSV (rBCG-N-hRSV) protects mice against hRSV infection, eliciting humoral and cellular immune protection. Further, this vaccine was shown to be safe and immunogenic in human adult volunteers. Here, we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of the rBCG-N-hRSV vaccine in a neonatal bovine RSV calf infection model. Newborn, colostrum-replete Holstein calves were either vaccinated with rBCG-N-hRSV, WT-BCG, or left unvaccinated, and then inoculated via aerosol challenge with bRSV strain 375. Vaccination with rBCG-N-hRSV was safe and well-tolerated, with no systemic adverse effects. There was no evidence of vaccine-enhanced disease following bRSV challenge of rBCG-N-hRSV vaccinated animals, suggesting that the vaccine is safe for use in neonates. Vaccination increased virus-specific IgA and virus-neutralization activity in nasal fluid and increased the proliferation of virus- and BCG-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PBMCs and lymph nodes at 7dpi. Furthermore, rBCG-N-hRSV vaccinated calves developed reduced clinical disease as compared to unvaccinated control calves, although neither pathology nor viral burden were significantly reduced in the lungs. These results suggest that the rBCG-N-hRSV vaccine is safe in neonatal calves and induces protective humoral and cellular immunity against this respiratory virus. These data from a newborn animal model provide further support to the notion that this vaccine approach could be considered as a candidate for infant immunization against RSV.

Fundamental evolution of all Orthocoronavirinae including three deadly lineages descendent from Chiroptera-hosted coronaviruses: SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2								CLADISTICS				37	5			461	488		10.1111/cla.12454		APR 2021		OCT 2021	2021	The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged in humans in 2002. Despite reports showing Chiroptera as the original animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, many argue that Carnivora-hosted viruses are the most likely origin. The emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 also involves Chiroptera-hosted lineages. However, factors such as the lack of comprehensive phylogenies hamper our understanding of host shifts once MERS-CoV emerged in humans and Artiodactyla. Since 2019, the origin of SARS-CoV-2, causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), added to this episodic history of zoonotic transmission events. Here we introduce a phylogenetic analysis of 2006 unique and complete genomes of different lineages of Orthocoronavirinae. We used gene annotations to align orthologous sequences for total evidence analysis under the parsimony optimality criterion. Deltacoronavirus and Gammacoronavirus were set as outgroups to understand spillovers of Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus among ten orders of animals. We corroborated that Chiroptera-hosted viruses are the sister group of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-related viruses.

The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has led scientists to explore other options such as the use of artificial intelligence driven tools as an alternative or a confirmatory approach for detection of viral pneumonia. In this paper, we utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach to detect viral pneumonia in x-ray images using a pretrained AlexNet model thereby adopting a transfer learning approach. The dataset used for the study was obtained in the form of optical Coherence Tomography and chest X-ray images made available by Kermany et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.17632/rscbjbr9sj.3) with a total number of 5853 pneumonia (positive) and normal (negative) images. To evaluate the average efficiency of the model, the dataset was split into on 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, 80:20 and 90:10 for training and testing respectively. To evaluate the performance of the model, 10 K Cross-validation was carried out. The performance of the model using overall dataset was compared with the means of cross-validation and the currents state of arts. The classification model has shown high performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. 70:30 split performed better compare to other splits with accuracy of 98.73%, sensitivity of 98.59% and specificity of 99.84%.

In recent decades, biotechnological advances have led to the development of numerous innovative therapeutic molecules and vaccine immunogens. However, we still lack effective treatments and vaccines against many respiratory pathogens. More than ever, there is a need for a fast, predictive, preclinical pipeline, to keep pace with emerging diseases. Animal models are key for the preclinical development of disease management strategies. The predictive value of these models depends on their ability to reproduce the features of the human disease, the mode of transmission of the infectious agent and the availability of technologies for monitoring infection. This review focuses on the use of nonhuman primates as relevant preclinical models for the development of prevention and treatment for human respiratory infections.

COVID-19 in humans is characterized by a wide range of symptoms that range from asymptomatic to mild or severe illness including death. SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and is transmitted via the oral-nasal route through droplets and aerosols, or through contact with contaminated fomites. House flies are known to transmit bacterial, parasitic and viral diseases to humans and animals as mechanical vectors. Previous studies have shown that house flies can mechanically transmit coronaviruses, such as turkey coronavirus; however, the house fly's role in SARS-CoV-2 transmission has not yet been explored. The goal of this work was to investigate the potential of house flies to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2. For this purpose, it was determined whether house flies can acquire SARS-CoV-2, harbor live virus and mechanically transmit the virus to naive substrates and surfaces.MethodsTwo independent studies were performed to address the study objectives. In the first study, house flies were tested for infectivity after exposure to SARS-CoV-2-spiked medium or milk. In the second study, environmental samples were tested for infectivity after contact with SARS-CoV-2-exposed flies. During both studies, samples were collected at various time points post-exposure and evaluated by SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR and virus isolation.ResultsAll flies exposed to SARS-CoV-2-spiked media or milk substrates were positive for viral RNA at 4 h and 24 h post-exposure. Infectious virus was isolated only from the flies exposed to virus-spiked milk but not from those exposed to virus-spiked medium. Moreover, viral RNA was detected in environmental samples after contact with SARS-CoV-2 exposed flies, although no infectious virus was recovered from these samples.ConclusionsUnder laboratory conditions, house flies acquired and harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 for up to 24 h post-exposure. In addition, house flies were able to mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA to the surrounding environment up to 24 h post-exposure. Further studies are warranted to determine if house fly transmission occurs naturally and the potential public health implications of such events.																					WOS:000642560700008	33879234

The detection of the viral genus was performed by RT-PCR, and infections with dengue (DENV 1-4), West Nile (WNV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses were subsequently explored. Sequences from positive products were analysed using the BLAST algorithm to determine identity. In 7 (31.8%) and 2 (9.1%) bats, WNV and ZIKV were identified, respectively. The bioinformatic analysis showed 98%-100% coverage and identity for both viruses. Molecular evidence of WNV and ZIKV natural infection in bats from Yucatan, Mexico, is presented.

All genera of Flaviviridae host a conserved Xrn1-resistant RNA motif								RNA BIOLOGY				18	12			2321	2329		10.1080/15476286.2021.1907044		APR 2021		DEC 2 2021	2021	After infection by flaviviruses like Zika and West Nile virus, eukaryotic hosts employ the well-conserved endoribonuclease Xrn1 to degrade the viral genomic RNA. Within the 3MODIFIER LETTER PRIME untranslated regions, this enzyme encounters intricate Xrn1-resistant structures. This results in the accumulation of subgenomic flaviviral RNAs, an event that improves viral growth and aggravates viral pathogenicity. Xrn1-resistant RNAs have been established throughout the flaviviral genus, but not yet throughout the entire Flaviviridae family. In this work, we use previously determined characteristics of these structures to identify homologous sequences in many members of the genera pegivirus, hepacivirus and pestivirus. We used structural alignment and mutational analyses to establish that these sequences indeed represent Xrn1-resistant RNA and that they employ the general features of the flaviviral xrRNAs, consisting of a double pseudoknot formed by five base-paired regions stitched together by a crucial triple base interaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pestivirus Bungowannah virus produces subgenomic RNA in vivo. Altogether, these results indicate that viruses make use of a universal Xrn1-resistant RNA throughout the Flaviviridae family.																					WOS:000641326000001	33858294

Subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) associated with Asian lineage Zika virus identified in three species of Ugandan bats (family Pteropodidae)								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					8370	10.1038/s41598-021-87816-5				APR 16 2021	2021	Serological cross-reactivity among flaviviruses makes determining the prior arbovirus exposure of animals challenging in areas where multiple flavivirus strains are circulating. We hypothesized that prior infection with ZIKV could be confirmed through the presence of subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) of the 3 ' untranslated region (UTR), which persists in tissues due to XRN-1 stalling during RNA decay. We amplified ZIKV sfRNA but not NS5 from three experimentally-infected Jamaican fruit bats, supporting the hypothesis of sfRNA tissue persistence. Applying this approach to 198 field samples from Uganda, we confirmed presence of ZIKV sfRNA, but not NS5, in four bats representing three species: Eidolon helvum (n=2), Epomophorus labiatus (n=1), and Rousettus aegyptiacus (n=1). Amplified sequence was most closely related to Asian lineage ZIKV. Our results support the use of sfRNA as a means of identifying previous flavivirus infection and describe the first detection of ZIKV RNA in East African bats.

Surveying the Vampire Bat (Desmodus rotundus) Serum Proteome: A Resource for Identifying Immunological Proteins and Detecting Pathogens								JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH				20	5			2547	2559		10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00995		APR 2021		MAY 7 2021	2021	Bats are increasingly studied as model systems for longevity and as natural hosts for some virulent viruses. Yet the ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 mu L of sample and relatively short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across 5 orders of magnitude. Levels of immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via published databases. Of particular interest were antiviral and antibacterial components, circulating 20S proteasome complex and proteins involved in redox activity. Lastly, we used known virus proteomes to putatively identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens. More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife immunology and pathogen surveillance.																					WOS:000649269600034	33840197

The disease was characterised by a respiratory disorder of variable severity ranging from mild upper respiratory tract illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe interstitial pneumonia and death. The source of the virus is yet to be confirmed but wild animals sold at wholesale seafood and exotic animal markets of Wuhan were implicated. The virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease designated as Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). As of the 13 January 2021, the WHO had reported 90 335 008 cases and 1 954 336 deaths in 216 countries. The isolation of related coronaviruses from bats suggests that they may be a potential host species.

Awareness campaigns are highly influential tools to expand healthy behavior practices among individuals during epidemics and pandemics. Mathematical modeling has become an important tool in analyzing the effects of media awareness on the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, a fractional-order epidemic model incorporating media coverage is presented and analyzed. The problem is formulated using susceptible, infectious and recovered compartmental model. A long-term memory effect modeled by a Caputo fractional derivative is included in each compartment to describe the evolution related to the individuals' experiences. The well-posedness of the model is investigated in terms of global existence, positivity, and boundedness of solutions. Moreover, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium points are given alongside their local stabilities. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, the global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria is proven according to the basic reproduction number R-0. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to support our analytical findings. It was found out that the long-term memory has no effect on the stability of the equilibrium points. However, for increased values of the fractional derivative order parameter, each solution reaches its equilibrium state more rapidly. Furthermore, it was observed that an increase of the media awareness parameter, decreases the magnitude of infected individuals, and consequently, the height of the epidemic peak.

Although anthropogenic land use change is known to be the major driver of zoonotic pathogen spillover from wildlife to human populations, the scientific underpinnings of land use induced zoonotic spillover have rarely been investigated from the landscape perspective. We call for interdisciplinary collaborations to advance knowledge on land use implications for zoonotic disease emergence with a view toward informing the decisions needed to protect human health. In particular, we urge a mechanistic focus on the zoonotic pathogen infect?shed?spill?spread cascade to enable protection of landscape immunity?the ecological conditions that reduce the risk of pathogen spillover from reservoir hosts?as a conservation and biosecurity priority. Results are urgently needed to formulate an integrated, holistic set of science-based policy and management measures that effectively and cost-efficiently minimise zoonotic disease risk.

Antibiotics applications not only affect target pathogens but also intestinal beneficially microbes, inducing long-lasting changes in intestinal microbiota associated with diseases. The application of antibiotics also has many other side effects like, intestinal barrier dysfunction, antibiotics residues in foodstuffs, nephropathy, allergy, bone marrow toxicity, mutagenicity, reproductive disorders, hepatotoxicity carcinogenicity, and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which greatly compromise the efficacy of antibiotics. Thus, the development of new antibiotics is necessary, while the search for antibiotic alternatives continues. Probiotics are considered the ideal antibiotic substitute; in recent years, probiotic research concerning their application during pathogenic infections in humans, aquaculture, poultry, and livestock industry, with emphasis on modulating the immune system of the host, has been attracting considerable interest. Hence, the adverse effects of antibiotics and remedial effects of probiotics during infectious diseases have become central points of focus among researchers. Probiotics are live microorganisms, and when given in adequate quantities, confer good health effects to the host through different mechanisms. Among them, the regulation of host immune response during pathogenic infections is one of the most important mechanisms. A number of studies have investigated different aspects of probiotics. In this review, we mainly summarize recent discoveries and discuss two important aspects: (1) the application of probiotics during pathogenic infections; and (2) their modulatory effects on the immune response of the host during infectious and non-infectious diseases.

Assessing the risks of SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife								ONE HEALTH OUTLOOK				3	1					7	10.1186/s42522-021-00039-6				APR 7 2021	2021	The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 likely emerged from a wildlife source with transmission to humans followed by rapid geographic spread throughout the globe and severe impacts on both human health and the global economy. Since the onset of the pandemic, there have been many instances of human-to-animal transmission involving companion, farmed and zoo animals, and limited evidence for spread into free-living wildlife. The establishment of reservoirs of infection in wild animals would create significant challenges to infection control in humans and could pose a threat to the welfare and conservation status of wildlife. We discuss the potential for exposure, onward transmission and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in an initial selection of wild mammals (bats, canids, felids, mustelids, great apes, rodents and cervids). Dynamic risk assessment and targeted surveillance are important tools for the early detection of infection in wildlife, and here we describe a framework for collating and synthesising emerging information to inform targeted surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in wildlife. Surveillance efforts should be integrated with information from public and veterinary health initiatives to provide insights into the potential role of wild mammals in the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2.

However, the real natural cycle of this virus remains to be elucidated. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to novel opportunities for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between humans and susceptible animal species. In silico and in vitro evaluation of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and eucaryotic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor have tentatively predicted susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection of several animal species. Although useful, these data do not always correlate with in vivo data obtained in experimental models or during natural infections. Other host biological properties may intervene such as the body temperature, level of receptor expression, co-receptor, restriction factors, and genetic background. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 also depends on the extent and duration of viral shedding in the infected host as well as population density and behaviour (group living and grooming). Overall, current data indicate that the most at-risk interactions between humans and animals for COVID-19 infection are those involving certain mustelids (such as minks and ferrets), rodents (such as hamsters), lagomorphs (especially rabbits), and felines (including cats). Therefore, special attention should be paid to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with pets.																					WOS:000643293400001	33920724

In this review, we narrated the available data, from credible publishers, regarding the possible role of polyphenols and natural extracts-containing polyphenols in the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and their immune-boosting properties. It was revealed that polyphenols could be considered as promising biologically active substances for the prevention of COVID-19. The underlying potential mechanism behind this action is mostly due to the antiviral activities and the immune-regulation functions of polyphenols against COVID-19-infections. Antivirus polyphenolic-based medications can mitigate SARS-CoV-2-enzymes, which are vital for virus duplication and infection. It was also found that triterpenoid, anthraquinone, flavonoids, and tannins are possible keys to scheming antiviral therapies for inhibiting SARSCoV-2-proteases. The identified pharmacophore structures of polyphenols could be utilized in the explanation of novel anti-COVID-19 designs. The advantage of using mixtures containing polyphenols is related to the high safety profile without having major side-effects, but further randomized controlled trials are required in the upcoming studies.

Despite an encouraging start, numbers of ferrets at the site have declined. In an effort to determine possible causes of the population decline, we undertook a pathogen survey in 2012 to detect exposure to West Nile virus (WNV), canine distemper virus (CDV), plague (Yersinia pestis), tularemia (Francisella tularensis), and heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) using coyotes (Canis latrans) as a sentinel animal. The highest seroprevalence was for WNV with 71% (20/28) of coyotes testing antibody-positive. Seroprevalence of CDV and plague were lower, 27% and 13%, respectively. No evidence of active infection with tularemia or heartworm was seen in the coyotes sampled. As this study did not sample black-footed ferrets themselves, the definitive cause for the decline of this population cannot be determined. However, the presence of coyotes seropositive for two diseases, plague and CDV, lethal to black-footed ferrets, indicated the potential for exposure and infection. The high seroprevalence of WNV in the coyotes indicated a wide exposure to the virus; therefore, exposure of black-footed ferrets to the virus is also likely. Due to the ability of WNV to cause fatal disease in other species, studies may be useful to elucidate the impact that WNV could have on the success of reintroduced black-footed ferrets as well as factors influencing the spread and incidence of the disease in a prairie ecosystem.

It was first reported in December 2019 in the Wuhan city of China and soon after, the virus and hence the disease got spread to the entire world. As of February 26, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected similar to 112.20 million people and caused similar to 2.49 million deaths across the globe. Although the case fatality rate among SARS-CoV-2 patient is lower (similar to 2.15%) than its earlier relatives, SARS-CoV (similar to 9.5%) and MERS-CoV (similar to 34.4%), the SARS-CoV-2 has been observed to be more infectious and caused higher morbidity and mortality worldwide. As of now, only the knowledge regarding potential transmission routes and the rapidly developed diagnostics has been guiding the world for managing the disease indicating an immediate need for a detailed understanding of the pathogen and the disease-biology. Over a very short period of time, researchers have generated a lot of information in unprecedented ways in the key areas, including viral entry into the host, dominant mutation, potential transmission routes, diagnostic targets and their detection assays, potential therapeutic targets and drug molecules for inhibiting viral entry and/or its replication in the host including cross-neutralizing antibodies and vaccine candidates that could help us to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the current review, we have summarized the available knowledge about the pathogen and the disease, COVID-19. We believe that this readily available knowledge base would serve as a valuable resource to the scientific and clinical community and may help in faster development of the solution to combat the disease.

Neutrophils, an important innate immune cell, infiltrate the lungs rapidly after an inflammatory insult. The most well-characterized effector mechanisms by which neutrophils contribute to host defense are largely extracellular and the involvement of neutrophils in protection from numerous bacterial and fungal infections is well established. However, the role of neutrophils in responses to viruses, which replicate intracellularly, has been less studied. It remains unclear whether and, by which underlying immunological mechanisms, neutrophils contribute to viral control or confer protection against an intracellular pathogen. Furthermore, neutrophils need to be tightly regulated to avoid bystander damage to host tissues. This is especially relevant in the lung where damage to delicate alveolar structures can compromise gas exchange with life-threatening consequences. It is inherently less clear how neutrophils can contribute to host immunity to viruses without causing immunopathology and/or exacerbating disease severity. In this review, we summarize and discuss the current understanding of how neutrophils in the lung direct immune responses to viruses, control viral replication and spread, and cause pathology during respiratory viral infections.

This exercise encompassed collaborations with a number of contract organizations with collaborative medicinal chemistry and virology during the optimization phase in addition to those utilized as the compound proceeded through preclinical and clinical evaluation. RV521 exhibited a mean IC50 of 1.2 nM against a panel of RSV A and B laboratory strains and clinical isolates with antiviral efficacy in the Balb/C mouse model of RSV infection. Oral bioavailability in preclinical species ranged from 42 to >100% with evidence of highly efficient penetration into lung tissue. In healthy adult human volunteers experimentally infected with RSV, a potent antiviral effect was observed with a significant reduction in viral load and symptoms compared to placebo.

The newly emerged strain of HCoV, the SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the recent global pandemic that has already caused the death of hundreds of thousands of people due to the lack of effective therapeutic options.Methods: In this study, immunoinformatics methods were used to design epitope-based polyvalent vaccines which are expected to be effective against four different pathogenic strains of HCoV i.e., HCoV-OC43, HCoV-SARS, HCoV-MERS, and SARS-CoV-2.Results: The constructed vaccines consist of highly antigenic, non-allergenic, nontoxic, conserved, and non-homologous T-cell and B-cell epitopes from all the four viral strains. Therefore, they should be able to provide strong protection against all these strains. Protein-protein docking was performed to predict the best vaccine construct. Later, the MD simulation and immune simulation of the best vaccine construct also predicted satisfactory results. Finally, in silico cloning was performed to develop a mass production strategy of the vaccine.Conclusion: If satisfactory results are achieved in further in vivo and in vitro studies, then the vaccines designed in this study might be effective as preventative measures against the selected HCoV strains.

J	Alnajjar, Sarhad; Sitthicharoenchai, Panchan; Gallup, Jack; Ackermann, Mark; Verhoeven, David								Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 22F infection in respiratory syncytial virus infected neonatal lambs enhances morbidity								PLOS ONE				16	3					e0235026	10.1371/journal.pone.0235026				MAR 11 2021	2021	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the primary cause of viral bronchiolitis resulting in hospitalization and a frequent cause of secondary respiratory bacterial infection, especially by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) in infants. While murine studies have demonstrated enhanced morbidity during a viral/bacterial co-infection, human meta-studies have conflicting results. Moreover, little knowledge about the pathogenesis of emerging Spn serotype 22F, especially the co-pathologies between RSV and Spn, is known. Here, colostrum-deprived neonate lambs were divided into four groups. Two of the groups were nebulized with RSV M37, and the other two groups were mock nebulized. At day three post-RSV infection, one RSV group (RSV/Spn) and one mock-nebulized group (Spn only) were inoculated with Spn intratracheally. At day six post-RSV infection, bacterial/viral loads were assessed along with histopathology and correlated with clinical symptoms. Lambs dually infected with RSV/Spn trended with higher RSV titers, but lower Spn. Additionally, lung lesions were observed to be more frequent in the RSV/Spn group characterized by increased interalveolar wall thickness accompanied by neutrophil and lymphocyte infiltration and higher myeloperoxidase. Despite lower Spn in lungs, co-infected lambs had more significant morbidity and histopathology, which correlated with a different cytokine response. Thus, enhanced disease severity during dual infection may be due to lesion development and altered immune responses rather than bacterial counts.																					WOS:000629590400086	33705390

Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. Several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and many are still under investigation. In this review, we will be focusing on the potency of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. Fever, cough, headache, dizziness, and fatigue are the common clinical manifestations in COVID-19 patients. In mild and severe cases, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In order to maintain the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients, MSCs are used as cell-based therapy approaches as they can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote endogenous repair. Besides, MSCs have shown minimal expression of ACE2 or TMPRSS2, and hence, MSCs are free from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Numerous clinical studies have started worldwide and demonstrated that MSCs have great potential for ARDS treatment in COVID-19 patients. Preliminary data have shown that MSCs and MSC-derived secretome appear to be promising in the treatment of COVID-19. Lay Summary The COVID-19 disease is an infection disease which affects the world in 2020. Currently, there is no definite treatment for COVID-19 patients. However, several clinical trials have been proposed to overcome this disease and one of them is using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSC-derived secretome for treating COVID-19 patients. During the infection, cytokines are released hyper-actively which causes a cytokine storm. MSCs play an important role in maintaining the lung microenvironment in COVID-19 patients. They can act as cell managers which accelerate the immune system to prevent the cytokine storm and promote the endogenous repair. Therefore, it is important to explore the clinical trial in the world for treating the COVID-19 disease using MSCs and MSC-derived secretome.																					WOS:000627196200001	33723519	
J	de Pina-Araujo, Isabel Ines M.; Horta, Marco Aurelio; do Amaral Mello, Francisco Campello; Soares, Caroline Cordeiro								Human pegivirus 1 in Cabo Verde: prevalence and genotypic distribution among HIV-infected individuals								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				166	5			1345	1353		10.1007/s00705-021-05014-0		MAR 2021		MAY 2021	2021	Human pegivirus 1 (HPgV-1) belongs to the genus Pegivirus, family Flaviviridae, and until now has been considered a non-pathogenic agent, despite being considered a risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. However, a beneficial impact of HPgV-1 on HIV disease progression has been extensively reported. Given the high prevalence of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and the scarcity of epidemiological data for many countries of West Africa, we conducted the first study of HPgV-1 in HIV-infected individuals from Cabo Verde. To obtain new data regarding prevalence and genetic diversity of HPgV-1 in Africa, serum samples from 102 HIV-infected Cabo Verdeans were tested for the presence of viral RNA, and the circulating genotypes were identified by sequencing of the 5' untranslated region. HPgV-1 RNA was detected in 19.6% (20/102) of the samples. In 72.2% (13/18) of the samples, the virus was identified as genotype 2 (11/13 subtype 2a and 2/13 subtype 2b), and in 27.8% (5/18), it was identified as genotype 1. The estimated substitution rate of HPgV-1 genotype 2 was 5.76 x 10(-4), and Bayesian analysis indicated the existence of inner clusters within subtypes 2a and 2b. The prevalence of HPgV-1 viremia in Cabo Verde agrees with that reported previously in Africa. Genotypes 1 and 2 cocirculate, with genotype 2 being more common, and HIV/HPgV-1 coinfection was not associated with higher CD4 T cell counts in the studied population. This finding contributes for the expansion of the pegivirus research agenda in African countries.																					WOS:000627207500002	33689039

The virus demonstrates 96% similarity to a coronavirus from a horseshoe bat and most probably emerged from a spill over from bats or wild animal(s) to humans. Currently, two variants are circulating in the UK and South Africa and spread to many countries around the world. The impact of mutations on virus replication, virulence and transmissibility should be monitored carefully. Current data suggest recurrent infection with SARS-CoV-2 correlated to the level of neutralising antibodies and with sustained memory responses following infection. Recently, remdesivir was FDA approved for treatment of COVID-19, however many potential antivirals are currently in different clinical trials. Clinical data and experimental studies indicated that licenced vaccines are helpful in controlling the disease. However, the current vaccines should be evaluated against the emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2.																					WOS:000637395000001	33691216	
J	El-Sayed, Amr; Kamel, Mohamed								Coronaviruses in humans and animals: the role of bats in viral evolution								ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH				28	16			19589	19600		10.1007/s11356-021-12553-1		MAR 2021		APR 2021	2021	Bats act as a natural reservoir for many viruses, including coronaviruses, and have played a crucial epidemiological role in the emergence of many viral diseases. Coronaviruses have been known for 60 years. They are usually responsible for the induction of mild respiratory signs in humans. However, since 2002, the bat-borne virus started to induce fatal epidemics according to WHO reports. In this year, the first serious human coronavirus epidemic (severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS) occurred (China, 8098 cases, 774 deaths [9.5% of the cases] in 17 countries). The case fatality was higher in elderly patients above 60 years and reached 50% of the cases. SARS epidemic was followed 10 years later by the emergence of the middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS) in Saudi Arabia (in 2012, 2260 cases, 803 deaths [35.5% of the cases] in 27 countries). Finally, in December 2019, a new epidemic in Wuhan, China, (corona virus disease 2019, COVID-19) emerged and could spread to 217 countries infecting more than 86,255,226 cases and killing 1,863,973 people by the end of 2020. There are many reasons why bats are ideal reservoir hosts for viral diseases such as the tolerance of their immune system to the invading viruses for several months. They can actively shed the viruses, although they develop no clinical signs (will be discussed in details later in the review). Bats were directly or indirectly involved in the three previous coronavirus epidemics. The indirect transmission takes place via intermediate hosts including civet cats for SARS and dromedary camels in the case of MERS. Although bats are believed to be the source of COVID-19 pandemic, direct pieces of evidence are still lacking. Therefore, coronaviruses' role in epidemics induction and the epidemiological role of bats are discussed. The current work also presents different evidence (phylogenetic data, animal experiments, bats artificial infection studies, and computerized models of SARS-CoV2 evolution) that underline the involvement of bats in the epidemiology of the pandemic.

Results indicated that virus sequences showing similarity to human pegivirus (HPgV), anellovirus, human endogenous retrovirus (HERV), and polyomavirus were recovered from this cohort. Three different complete genomes of HPgV were acquired from the blood samples and one complete genome of polyomavirus was determined from the cancer tissue sample. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the three HPgV strains belonged to genotype 3 and the polyomavirus showed the highest sequence identity (99.73%) to trichodysplasia spinulosa-associated polyomavirus. PCR screening results indicated that the three HPgVs were present in 5 out of the 25 blood samples and the polyomavirus only existed in a cancer tissue sample pool. Whether infections with viruses have an association with lung cancer needs further study with a larger size of sampling.																					WOS:000623315700001	33595122

Functional Analysis of the Fusion and Attachment Glycoproteins of Mojiang Henipavirus								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	3					517	10.3390/v13030517				MAR 2021	2021	Mojiang virus (MojV) is the first henipavirus identified in a rodent and known only by sequence data, whereas all other henipaviruses have been isolated from bats (Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Cedar virus) or discovered by sequence data from material of bat origin (Ghana virus). Ephrin-B2 and -B3 are entry receptors for Hendra and Nipah viruses, but Cedar virus can utilize human ephrin-B1, -B2, -A2 and -A5 and mouse ephrin-A1. However, the entry receptor for MojV remains unknown, and its species tropism is not well characterized. Here, we utilized recombinant full-length and soluble forms of the MojV fusion (F) and attachment (G) glycoproteins in membrane fusion and receptor tropism studies. MojV F and G were functionally competent and mediated cell-cell fusion in primate and rattine cells, albeit with low levels and slow fusion kinetics. Although a relative instability of the pre-fusion conformation of a soluble form of MojV F was observed, MojV F displayed significantly greater fusion activity when heterotypically paired with Ghana virus G. An exhaustive investigation of A- and B-class ephrins indicated that none serve as a primary receptor for MojV. The MojV cell fusion phenotype is therefore likely the result of receptor restriction rather than functional defects in recombinant MojV F and G glycoproteins.

Moreover, infections under natural conditions in more than 20 mink farms have been reported where humans could have been the source of infection for minks. However, little information is available about the susceptibility of pet animals under natural conditions and currently there is no SARS-CoV-2 epidemiological assessment occurrence in household ferrets. In this study, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was evaluated in serum samples obtained from 127 household ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) in the Province of Valencia (Spain). Two ferrets tested positive to SARS-CoV-2 (1.57%) by in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike antigen. Furthermore, anti-RBD SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persisted at detectable levels in a seropositive SARS-CoV-2 domestic ferret beyond 129 days since the first-time antibodies were detected.

J	Hancock, John T.; Rouse, Ros C.; Stone, Emma; Greenhough, Alexander								Interacting Proteins, Polymorphisms and the Susceptibility of Animals to SARS-CoV-2								ANIMALS				11	3					797	10.3390/ani11030797				MAR 2021	2021	Simple SummaryCOVID-19 is the disease caused by a coronavirus: SARS-CoV-2. The disease was declared by WHO in March 2020 as a pandemic and is still affecting countries around the world. Although considered a human disease, it is thought to have its origins in bats, and transmitted to humans potentially through an intermediate animal. What is not fully understood is the likelihood of the virus transmitting back to animal populations, either to companion or wild animals. For the virus to enter host cells, it needs to interact with particular proteins on the cell surface. Here we review the susceptibility of animals to the SARS-CoV-2 virus through the comparison of proteins between animals and humans. The most studied is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), which has been used to rank the viral susceptibility of a range of vertebrates. Here, we also assess three other proteins. Of these, TMPRSS2 may be helpful in determining susceptibility, whereas the other two would appear to be of limited use. We propose that future work should examine changes seen in these proteins which alter the ease by which the virus can enter cells. This type of analysis may contribute limited evidence in predicting if animals are safe from such viruses and may help to guide future welfare concerns.COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide problem for the human population. It is known that some animal species, such as mink, can become infected and transmit the virus. However, the susceptibility of most animals is not known. Here, we review the use of sequence analysis of the proteins which are known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 as a way to estimate an animal's susceptibility. Although most such work concentrates on the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2), here TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2), neuropilin-1 and furin are also considered. Polymorphisms, especially ones which are known to alter viral/host interactions are also discussed. Analysis of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 protein sequences across species suggests this approach may be of some utility in predicting susceptibility; however, this analysis fails to highlight some susceptible animals such as mink. However, combined with observational data which emerges over time about which animals actually become infected, this may, in the future, be a useful tool to assist the management of risks associated with human/animal contact and support conservation and animal welfare measures.

Henipaviruses have bat reservoir hosts and have been isolated from fruit bats found across Oceania, Asia, and Africa. Bat-to-human transmission is thought to be the primary mode of human NiV infection, although multiple intermediate hosts are described. Human infections with NiV were originally described as a syndrome of fever and rapid neurological decline following contact with swine. More recent outbreaks describe a syndrome with prominent respiratory symptoms and human-to-human transmission. Nearly annual outbreaks have been described since 1998 with case fatality rates reaching greater than 90%. The ubiquitous nature of the reservoir host, increasing deforestation, multiple mode of transmission, high case fatality rate, and lack of effective therapy or vaccines make NiV's pandemic potential increasingly significant. Here we review the epidemiology and microbiology of NiV as well as the therapeutic agents and vaccines in development.																					WOS:000633084100001	33672796

Challenges in Having Vaccines Available to Control Transboundary Diseases of Livestock								CURRENT ISSUES IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				42				1	40		10.21775/cimb.042.001				MAR 2021	2021	The global human population is growing at a rapid rate leading to the need for continued expansion of food animal production to meet the world's increasing nutritional requirements. As a consequence of this increased production demand, the use of high volume, animal dense systems have expanded providing high quality protein at reduced costs. Backyard animal production has also expanded. This increased food animal production has facilitated the rapid spread, mutation, and adaptation of pathogens to new hosts. This scenario continues to drive the emergence and reemergence of diseases in livestock species increasing the urgency for development and availability of vaccines for transboundary animal diseases (TADs). Even though vaccines are widely recognized as being an essential tool for control of TADs, there are many scientific, economic, political, and logistical challenges to having vaccine available to control an outbreak. This article will focus on examples of the challenges associated with having vaccines available for emergency response, as well as the characteristics of "ideal" TAD vaccines, the need for complementary diagnostic assays, and hurdles involved in bringing efficacious veterinary TAD vaccines to market including regulatory constraints and considerations for stockpiling vaccines for emergency use in non-endemic countries. Examples will also highlight the complicated interplay between animal health and human health and demonstrate the lasting benefits that can be gained from an efficacious vaccine.

NANOMATERIALS				11	3					796	10.3390/nano11030796				MAR 2021	2021	Every day, new information is presented with respect to how to best combat the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This manuscript sheds light on such recent findings, including new co-factors (i.e., neuropilin-1) and routes (i.e., olfactory transmucosal) allowing cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and induction of neurological symptoms, as well as the new SARS-CoV-2 variants. We highlight the SARS-CoV-2 human-animal interfaces and elaborate containment strategies using the same vaccination (i.e., nanoparticle "NP" formulations of the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines) for humans, minks, raccoon dogs, cats, and zoo animals. We investigate the toxicity issues of anti-CoV NPs (i.e., plasmonic NPs and quantum dots) on different levels. Namely, nano-bio interfaces (i.e., protein corona), in vitro (i.e., lung cells) and in vivo (i.e., zebrafish embryos) assessments, and impacts on humans are discussed in a narrative supported by original figures. Ultimately, we express our skeptical opinion on the comprehensive administration of such antiviral nanotheranostics, even when integrated into facemasks, because of their reported toxicities and the different NP parameters (e.g., size, shape, surface charge, and purity and chemical composition of NPs) that govern their end toxicity. We believe that more toxicity studies should be performed and be presented, clarifying the odds of the safe administration of nanotoxocological solutions and the relief of a worried public.

Echinacea purpurea is a traditional herb utilized to treat cough, fever, sore throat, respiratory tract infection, and so on as an immune stimulant. In this study, in silico molecular docking approach was used to screen phytocompounds from E. purpurea against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 main protease 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus main peptidase (96% sequence similarity) to blunt the viral gene expression and viral replication. Methods: Initially, we screened phytocompounds for their druggability and ADMET property. Furthermore, x-ray crystallographic structures of main proteases 3CLpro and main peptidase having Protein Data Bank ID 6LU7 and 2GTB were used as protein targets for the identification of potential drug candidates. We performed docking using AutoDock Vina by PyRx 0.8 software. BIOVIA Discovery Studio Visualizer v2019 was used to analyze ligand-protein complex. The probable protein targets of the selected compound were predicted by BindingDB (P = 0.7). STRING and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways are utilized to identify the molecular pathways modulated by the predicted targets (FDR = 0.05), and the network interaction between compounds and protein pathways was constructed by Cytoscape 3.6.1. Results: Among all the compounds, chlorogenic acid showed druggable characteristics and scored the lowest binding energy with main protease and main peptidase via interacting with active site 1 domain amino acid residues. Interestingly, chlorogenic acid interacted with Phe140 main protease 3CLpro, which is potentially involved in the dimerization. Enrichment analysis identified chlorogenic acid to modulate insulin resistance, necroptosis, interleukin-17, tumor necrosis factor signaling pathway, legionellosis, T helper 17 cell differentiation, advanced glycation end products and receptor for advanced glycation end products, mitogen-activated protein kinase, Ras, estrogen, vascular endothelial growth factor, B-cell receptor, nuclear factor kappa B, Rap1, hypoxia inducible factor-1, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-Akt, insulin, mechanistic target of rapamycin, p53, retinoic acid inducible gene I like receptor, and ErbB signaling pathways. Conclusion: Chlorogenic acid may act as a potent main protease 3CLpro inhibitor and may also inhibit the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 dimerization, viral gene expression, and replication within the lung epithelium. Chlorogenic acid may go a long way in finding one of the multipronged solutions to tackle coronavirus disease 2019 viral infection in the future.																					WOS:000608243900010

Recently, the impact of COVID-19 has relegated bats from biomedical darkness to the frontline of public health as bats are the natural reservoir of many viruses, including SARS-Cov-2. Many bat genomes have been sequenced recently, and sequences coding for antimicrobial peptides are available in the public databases. Here we provide a structural analysis of genome-predicted bat cathelicidins as components of their innate immunity. A total of 32 unique protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI database. Interestingly, some bat species contained more than one cathelicidin. We examined the conserved cysteines within the cathelin-like domain and the peptide portion of each sequence and revealed phylogenetic relationships and structural dissimilarities. The antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity of peptides was examined using bioinformatic tools. The peptides were modeled and subjected to docking analysis with the region binding domain (RBD) region of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The appearance of multiple forms of cathelicidins verifies the complex microbial challenges encountered by these species. Learning more about antiviral defenses of bats and how they drive virus evolution will help scientists to investigate the function of antimicrobial peptides in these species.

Molecular and Cellular Mechanisms of Respiratory Syncytial Viral Infection: Using Murine Models to Understand Human Pathology								BIOCHEMISTRY-MOSCOW				86	3			290	306		10.1134/S0006297921030068				MAR 2021	2021	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes severe pathology of the lower respiratory tract in infants, immunocompromised people, and elderly. Despite decades of research, there is no licensed vaccine against RSV, and many therapeutic drugs are still under development. Detailed understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the RSV infection pathology can accelerate the development of efficacious treatment. Current studies on the RSV pathogenesis are based on the analysis of biopsies from the infected patients; however deeper understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the RSV pathology could be achieved using animal models. Mice are the most often used model for RSV infection because they exhibit manifestations similar to those observed in humans (bronchial obstruction, mucous hypersecretion, and pulmonary inflammation mediated by lymphocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils). Additionally, the use of mice is economically feasible, and many molecular tools are available for studying RSV infection pathogenesis at the molecular and cellular levels. This review summarizes new data on the pathogenesis of RSV infection obtained in mouse models, which demonstrated the role of T cells in both the antiviral defense and the development of lung immunopathology. T cells not only eliminate the infected cells, but also produce significant amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF alpha and IFN gamma. Recently, a new subset of tissue-resident memory T cells (T-RM) was identified that provide a strong antiviral defense without induction of lung immunopathology. These cells accumulate in the lungs after local rather than systemic administration of RSV antigens, which suggests new approaches to vaccination. The studies in mouse models have revealed a minor role of interferons in the anti-RSV protection, as RSV possesses mechanisms to escape the antiviral action of type I and III interferons, which may explain the low efficacy of interferon-containing drugs. Using knockout mice, a significant breakthrough has been achieved in understanding the role of many pro-inflammatory cytokines in lung immunopathology. It was found that in addition to TNF alpha and IFN gamma, the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-33, and TSLP mediate the major manifestations of the RSV pathogenesis, such as bronchial obstruction, mucus hyperproduction, and lung infiltration by pro-inflammatory cells, while IL-6, IL-10, and IL-27 exhibit the anti-inflammatory effect. Despite significant differences between the mouse and human immune systems, mouse models have made a significant contribution to the understanding of molecular and cellular mechanisms of the pathology of human RSV infection.

The COVID-19 infections were also reported on farm and pet animals, which were discussed and summarized in this study. Although the damage of COVID-19 has not been reported as serious as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) for poultry and African Swine Fever (ASF) for pigs on commercial farms so far, the transmission mechanism of COVID-19 among group animals/farms and its long-term impacts are still not clear. Prior to the development of the effective vaccine, the biosecurity measures (e.g., conventional disinfection strategies and innovated technologies) may play roles in preventing potential spread of diseases/viruses.COVID-19 is caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 that belongings to the family of Coronaviridae, which has affected multiple species and demonstrated zoonotic potential. The COVID-19 infections have been reported on farm animals (e.g., minks) and pets, which were discussed and summarized in this study. Although the damage of COVID-19 has not been reported as serious as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) for poultry and African Swine Fever (ASF) for pigs on commercial farms so far, the transmission mechanism of COVID-19 among group animals/farms and its long-term impacts are still not clear. Prior to the marketing of efficient vaccines for livestock and animals, on-farm biosecurity measures (e.g., conventional disinfection strategies and innovated technologies) need to be considered or innovated in preventing the direct contact spread or the airborne transmission of COVID-19.

Coronavirus arc sub-microscopic, single stranded positive sense RNA viruses that leads to multi organ dysfunction syndrome. severe acute and chronic respiratory distress syndrome and pneumonia. The spike glycoprotein structure of the virus causes the viral protein to bind with the receptors on the lung and gut through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In some cases, the infected patients become hyper to the immune system because of the uncontrolled production of cytokines resulting in "cytokine storm", a devastating consequence of coronavirus disease 2019. Due to the rapid mutant strain and infective nature of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. discovering a drug or developing a vaccine remains a global challenge. However. some anti-viral agents. certain protease inhibitor drugs. non-steroidal inflammatory drugs and convalescent plasma treatment Were suggested. The containment and social distancing measures only aim at reducing the rate of new infections. In this view, we suggest certain traditional herbs and complementary and alternative medicine as a supporting public healthcare measure to boost the immune system and also may provide some lead to treat and present this infection.

The Wuhan wild animal market, in Hubei province, China is considered the epicenter of this pandemic. WHO declared the name COVID-19 to designate the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It is the third coronavirus pandemic after SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012. Genome sequencing of this new COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 virus shows slight genetic diversity when compared to other coronaviruses. Owing to its pathogenesis, and less known replication cycle, no universal antiviral treatment can be applied and vaccine preparation is still a larger challenge. The present article will highlight transmission, pandemic status, genetic diversity current antiviral therapy, and vaccine trials for COVID-19.																					WOS:000634506200002

Virus-host receptor binding and infection assays, including receptors of 46 bat species, show dramatic variation in susceptibility to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection among bat species.Bats are the suggested natural hosts for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the causal agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, SARS-CoV-2. The interaction of viral spike proteins with their host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a critical determinant of potential hosts and cross-species transmission. Here we use virus-host receptor binding and infection assays to examine 46 ACE2 orthologues from phylogenetically diverse bat species, including those in close and distant contact with humans. We found that 24, 21 and 16 of them failed to support infection by SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 or both viruses, respectively. Furthermore, we confirmed that infection assays in human cells were consistent with those in two bat cell lines. Additionally, we used genetic and functional analyses to identify critical residues in bat ACE2 receptors associated with viral entry restrictions. Our results suggest that many bat species may not be the potential hosts of one or both viruses and that no correlation was identified between proximity to humans and probability of being natural hosts of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. This study demonstrates dramatic variation in susceptibility to SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection among bat species and adds knowledge towards a better understanding of coronavirus-bat interaction.

Commonly, virus-infected tissues are analyzed using conventional immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded thin sections. Here, we demonstrate the utility of volumetric three-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging using tissue optical clearing and light sheet microscopy to investigate host-pathogen interactions of pandemic SARS-CoV-2 in ferrets at a mesoscopic scale. The superior spatial context of large, intact samples (>150 mm(3)) allowed detailed quantification of interrelated parameters like focus-to-focus distance or SARS-CoV-2-infected area, facilitating an in-depth description of SARS-CoV-2 infection foci. Accordingly, we could confirm a preferential infection of the ferret upper respiratory tract by SARS-CoV-2 and suggest clustering of infection foci in close proximity. Conclusively, we present a proof-of-concept study for investigating critically important respiratory pathogens in their spatial tissue morphology and demonstrate the first specific 3D visualization of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

J	Koonin, Eugene, V; Dolja, Valerian V.; Krupovic, Mart								The healthy human virome: from virus-host symbiosis to disease								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				47				86	94		10.1016/j.coviro.2021.02.002		FEB 2021		APR 2021	2021	Viruses are ubiquitous, essential components of any ecosystem, and of multicellular organism holobionts. Numerous viruses cause acute infection, killing the host or being cleared by immune system. In many other cases, viruses coexist with the host as symbionts, either temporarily or for the duration of the host's life. Apparently, virus-host relationships span the entire range from aggressive parasitism to mutualism. Here we attempt to delineate the healthy human virome, that is, the entirety of viruses that are present in a healthy human body. The bulk of the healthy virome consists of bacteriophages infecting bacteria in the intestine and other locations. However, a variety of viruses, such as anelloviruses and herpesviruses, and the numerous endogenous retroviruses, persist by replicating in human cells, and these are our primary focus. Crucially, the boundary between symbiotic and pathogenic viruses is fluid such that members of the healthy virome can become pathogens under changing conditions.

SARS-CoV-2 mimics the influenza virus regarding methods and modes of transmission, clinical features, related immune responses, and seasonal coincidence. Accordingly, co infection by these viruses is imaginable because some studies have reported several cases with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection. Given the importance of the mentioned co-infection and the coming influenza season, it is essential to recognize the similarities and differences between the symptoms, immunopathogenesis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus. Therefore, we reviewed the virology, clinical features, and immunopathogenesis of both influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 and evaluated outcomes in cases with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus co-infection.

Neurologic Manifestations of the World Health Organization's List of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases								FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY				12						634827	10.3389/fneur.2021.634827				FEB 22 2021	2021	The World Health Organization (WHO) monitors the spread of diseases globally and maintains a list of diseases with epidemic or pandemic potential. Currently listed diseases include Chikungunya, cholera, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Ebola virus disease, Hendra virus infection, influenza, Lassa fever, Marburg virus disease, Neisseria meningitis, MERS-CoV, monkeypox, Nipah virus infection, novel coronavirus (COVID-19), plague, Rift Valley fever, SARS, smallpox, tularemia, yellow fever, and Zika virus disease. The associated pathogens are increasingly important on the global stage. The majority of these diseases have neurological manifestations. Those with less frequent neurological manifestations may also have important consequences. This is highlighted now in particular through the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and reinforces that pathogens with the potential to spread rapidly and widely, in spite of concerted global efforts, may affect the nervous system. We searched the scientific literature, dating from 1934 to August 2020, to compile data on the cause, epidemiology, clinical presentation, neuroimaging features, and treatment of each of the diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential as viewed through a neurologist's lens. We included articles with an abstract or full text in English in this topical and scoping review. Diseases with epidemic and pandemic potential can be spread directly from human to human, animal to human, via mosquitoes or other insects, or via environmental contamination. Manifestations include central neurologic conditions (meningitis, encephalitis, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, seizures), peripheral and cranial nerve syndromes (sensory neuropathy, sensorineural hearing loss, ophthalmoplegia), post-infectious syndromes (acute inflammatory polyneuropathy), and congenital syndromes (fetal microcephaly), among others. Some diseases have not been well-characterized from a neurological standpoint, but all have at least scattered case reports of neurological features. Some of the diseases have curative treatments available while in other cases, supportive care remains the only management option. Regardless of the pathogen, prompt, and aggressive measures to control the spread of these agents are the most important factors in lowering the overall morbidity and mortality they can cause.

J	Beyer, Robert M.; Manica, Andrea; Mora, Camilo								Shifts in global bat diversity suggest a possible role of climate change in the emergence of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				767						145413	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.145413		FEB 2021		MAY 1 2021	2021	Bats are the likely zoonotic origin of several coronaviruses (CoVs) that infect humans, including SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, both ofwhich have caused large-scale epidemics. The number of CoVs present in an area is strongly correlatedwith local bat species richness, which in turn is affected by climatic conditions that drive the geographical distributions of species. Herewe showthat the southern Chinese Yunnan province and neighbouring regions in Myanmar and Laos form a global hotspot of climate change-driven increase in bat richness. This region coincides with the likely spatial origin of bat-borne ancestors of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2. Accounting for an estimated increase in the order of 100 bat-borne CoVs across the region, climate change may have played a key role in the evolution or transmission of the two SARS CoVs.

Although a vaccine has recently been approved, there are currently few effective therapeutics to fight its associated disease in humans, COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 and the related severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1), and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) result from zoonotic respiratory viruses that have bats as the primary host and an as yet unknown secondary host. While each of these viruses has different protein-based cell-surface receptors, each rely on the glycosaminoglycan, heparan sulfate as a co-receptor. In this study we compare, for the first time, differences and similarities in the structure of heparan sulfate in human and bat lungs. Furthermore, we show that the spike glycoprotein of COVID-19 binds 3.5 times stronger to human lung heparan sulfate than bat lung heparan sulfate.																					WOS:000632930600003	33712145

A lot of factors have contributed to it: deforestation, changes in forest habitats, poorly regulated agricultural surfaces, mismanaged urban growth. They have altered the composition of wildlife communities, greatly increased the contacts of humans with wildlife, and altered niches that harbor pathogens, increasing their chances to come in contact with humans. Among the wildlife, bats have adapted easily to anthropized environments such as houses, barns, cultivated fields, orchards, where they found the suitable ecosystem to prosper. Bats are major hosts for alpha CoV and beta CoV: evolution has shaped their peculiar physiology and their immune system in a way that makes them resistant to viral pathogens that would instead successfully attack other species, including humans. In time, the coronaviruses that bats host as reservoirs have undergone recombination and other modifications that have increased their ability for inter-species transmission: one modification of particular importance has been the development of the ability to use ACE2 as a receptor in host cells. This particular development in CoVs has been responsible for the serious outbreaks in the last two decades, and for the present COVID-19 pandemic. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis of lung transcriptome in calves infected with Bovine Respiratory Syncytial Virus and treated with antiviral and/or cyclooxygenase inhibitor								PLOS ONE				16	2					e0246695	10.1371/journal.pone.0246695				FEB 18 2021	2021	Bovine Respiratory Syncytial virus (BRSV) is one of the major infectious agents in the etiology of the bovine respiratory disease complex. BRSV causes a respiratory syndrome in calves, which is associated with severe bronchiolitis. In this study we describe the effect of treatment with antiviral fusion protein inhibitor (FPI) and ibuprofen, on gene expression in lung tissue of calves infected with BRSV. Calves infected with BRSV are an excellent model of human RSV in infants: we hypothesized that FPI in combination with ibuprofen would provide the best therapeutic intervention for both species. The following experimental treatment groups of BRSV infected calves were used: 1) ibuprofen day 3-10, 2) ibuprofen day 5-10, 3) placebo, 4) FPI day 5-10, 5) FPI and ibuprofen day 5-10, 6) FPI and ibuprofen day 3-10. All calves were infected with BRSV on day 0. Daily clinical evaluation with monitoring of virus shedding by qRT-PCR was conducted. On day10 lung tissue with lesions (LL) and non-lesional (LN) was collected at necropsy, total RNA extracted, and RNA sequencing performed. Differential gene expression analysis was conducted with Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis. The most significant differential gene expression in BRSV infected lung tissues was observed in the comparison of LL with LN; oxidative stress and cell damage was especially noticeable. Innate and adaptive immune functions were reduced in LL. As expected, combined treatment with FPI and Ibuprofen, when started early, made the most difference in gene expression patterns in comparison with placebo, especially in pathways related to the innate and adaptive immune response in both LL and LN. Ibuprofen, when used alone, negatively affected the antiviral response and caused higher virus loads as shown by increased viral shedding. In contrast, when used with FPI Ibuprofen enhanced the specific antiviral effect of FPI, due to its ability to reduce the damaging effect of prostanoids and oxidative stress.

J	Maldonado, Lucas L.; Mendoza Bertelli, Andrea; Kamenetzky, Laura								Molecular features similarities between SARS-CoV-2, SARS, MERS and key human genes could favour the viral infections and trigger collateral effects								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				11	1					4108	10.1038/s41598-021-83595-1				FEB 18 2021	2021	In December 2019, rising pneumonia cases caused by a novel beta -coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in Wuhan, China, which has rapidly spread worldwide, causing thousands of deaths. The WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern, since then several scientists are dedicated to its study. It has been observed that many human viruses have codon usage biases that match highly expressed proteins in the tissues they infect and depend on the host cell machinery for the replication and co-evolution. In this work, we analysed 91 molecular features and codon usage patterns for 339 viral genes and 463 human genes that consisted of 677,873 codon positions. Hereby, we selected the highly expressed genes from human lung tissue to perform computational studies that permit to compare their molecular features with those of SARS, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS genes. The integrated analysis of all the features revealed that certain viral genes and overexpressed human genes have similar codon usage patterns. The main pattern was the A/T bias that together with other features could propitiate the viral infection, enhanced by a host dependant specialization of the translation machinery of only some of the overexpressed genes. The envelope protein E, the membrane glycoprotein M and ORF7 could be further benefited. This could be the key for a facilitated translation and viral replication conducting to different comorbidities depending on the genetic variability of population due to the host translation machinery. This is the first codon usage approach that reveals which human genes could be potentially deregulated due to the codon usage similarities between the host and the viral genes when the virus is already inside the human cells of the lung tissues. Our work leaded to the identification of additional highly expressed human genes which are not the usual suspects but might play a role in the viral infection and settle the basis for further research in the field of human genetics associated with new viral infections. To identify the genes that could be deregulated under a viral infection is important to predict the collateral effects and determine which individuals would be more susceptible based on their genetic features and comorbidities associated.

Countries with higher prevalence of exposed obese individuals experienced the highest number of mortalities. The analysis also proved that individuals having more adipose tissue in body have a higher level of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is identified as functional receptor for COVID-19. Therefore, obese individuals are worse in condition because of a higher presence of adiposity increases the number of ACE2 expressing cells. Furthermore, in silico interactions of ACE2 and different variants of coronavirus 2 (CoV-2) spike S1 protein suggest that mutant strains are more infectious than wildtype as they bind to host ACE2 protein with high binding affinities. Certain specific cancers including cervical cancer, pancreatic and rectal adenocarcinomas have more expression of such receptors and pose additional risk to already immunocompromised cancer patients. This review emphasizes obesity, as the covert risk factor of COVID-19 infection and sensitizes about of calorie restrictions, immunity building and preventive measures.

Although the COVID-19 infection transmits on physical closeness, yet the staff of several public and private sectors are bound to move away from their shelters and perform their mandatory duties and other social responsibilities, thus, are probable prone to face the infection, mostly through mucosal routes. Accordingly, they need obligatory respiratory protection and physical coverage especially while dealing with suspectable COVID-19 infectees. This has resulted in worldwide demand for personal protection equipment (PPE), especially with effective antiviral activity and reusability. The common PPE like face masks, gowns, aprons and gloves, etc. come under the textile range of products. To make them effective, the PPE material should be treated with a suitable antiviral agent at appropriate stage of processing. In the current scenario, the development and characterization of new antiviral agents, particularly against COVID-19, would be a time-limited job largely when the universities are closed worldwide, and the research activities have been discontinued. Henceforth, the focus of the present review is to look at some already available antibacterial and antimicrobial agents that might exhibit potential antiviral activity. Such agents could be in hand antiviral finishes for textile-based PPE against the COVID-infection.																					WOS:000619355500001

Porcine DCoV has since spread worldwide and is associated with multiple outbreaks of diarrheal disease of variable severity in farmed pigs. In contrast, avian DCoV is being reported in wild birds in different countries without any evidence of disease. The DCoV transboundary nature and the recent discovery of its remarkably broad reactivity with its cellular receptor-aminopeptidase N (APN)-from different species emphasize its epidemiological relevance and necessitate additional research. Further, the ability of porcine DCoV to infect and cause disease in chicks and turkey poults and gnotobiotic calves is suggestive of its increased potential for interspecies transmission or of its avian origin. Whether, porcine DCoVs were initially acquired by one or several mammalian species from birds and whether avian and porcine DCoVs continue co-evolving with frequent spillover events remain to be major unanswered questions. In this review, we will discuss the current information on the prevalence, genetic diversity, and pathogenic potential of porcine and avian DCoVs. We will also analyze the existing evidence of the ongoing interspecies transmission of DCoVs that may provide novel insights into their complex evolution.

Abdel								Tissue Lipidomic Alterations Induced by Prolonged Dexamethasone Treatment								JOURNAL OF PROTEOME RESEARCH				20	3			1558	1570		10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00759		FEB 2021		MAR 5 2021	2021	Dexamethasone is a synthetic glucocorticoid medication vastly used to treat abnormal immune responses and inflammation. Although the medication is well-established in the medical community, the prolonged treatment with high dosages of dexamethasone may lead to severe adverse effects through mechanisms that are not yet well-known. Lipids are a large class of hydrophobic molecules involved in energy storage, signaling, modulation of gene expression, and membranes. Hence, untargeted lipidomics may help unravel the biochemical alterations following prolonged treatment with high dosages of dexamethasone. We performed comprehensive lipidomic analyses of brain, heart, kidney, liver, and muscle samples obtained from rats that were treated with intramuscular injections of dexamethasone for 14 weeks compared to healthy controls. The employed methodology and statistical analysis showed that phosphatidic acids, glycerophospholipids, plasmalogens, and fatty acids are deeply affected by prolonged use of the medication. Brain tissue was only mildly affected, but skeletal muscle showed a strong accumulation of lipids that may be correlated with alterations in the energy metabolism, myopathy, and oxidative processes. This work provides new insights into the mechanisms of action and adverse effects for one of the most commonly prescribed class of drugs in the world.

Our study assessed attenuated recombinant RSVs as vaccine candidates to prevent RSV infection in mice. The constructed recombinant plasmids harbored (5 ' to 3 ') a T7 promoter, hammerhead ribozyme, RSV Long strain antigenomic cDNA with cold-passaged (cp) mutations or cp combined with temperature-sensitive attenuated mutations from the A2 strain (A2cpts) or further combined with SH gene deletion (A2cpts Delta SH), HDV ribozyme (delta), and a T7 terminator. These vectors were subsequently co-transfected with four helper plasmids encoding N, P, L, and M2-1 viral proteins into BHK/T7-9 cells, and the recovered viruses were then passaged in Vero cells. The rescued recombinant RSVs (rRSVs) were named rRSV-Long/A2cp, rRSV-Long/A2cpts, and rRSV-Long/A2cpts Delta SH, respectively, and stably passaged in vitro, without reversion to wild type (wt) at sites containing introduced mutations or deletion. Although rRSV-Long/A2cpts and rRSV-Long/A2cpts Delta SH displayed temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype in vitro and in vivo, all rRSVs were significantly attenuated in vivo. Furthermore, BALB/c mice immunized with rRSVs produced Th1-biased immune response, resisted wtRSV infection, and were free from enhanced respiratory disease. We showed that the combination of Delta SH with attenuation (att) mutations of cpts contributed to improving att phenotype, efficacy, and gene stability of rRSV. By successfully introducing att mutations and SH gene deletion into the RSV Long parent and producing three rRSV strains, we have laid an important foundation for the development of RSV live attenuated vaccines.

Climate change: how it impacts the emergence, transmission, resistance and consequences of viral infections in animals and plants								CRITICAL REVIEWS IN MICROBIOLOGY				47	3			307	322		10.1080/1040841X.2021.1879006		FEB 2021		MAY 4 2021	2021	The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has made us wonder what led to its occurrence and what can be done to avoid such events in the future. As we document, one changing circumstance that is resulting in the emergence and changing the expression of viral diseases in both plants and animals is climate change. Of note, the rapidly changing environment and weather conditions such as excessive flooding, droughts, and forest fires have raised concerns about the global ecosystem's security, sustainability, and balance. In this review, we discuss the main consequences of climate change and link these to how they impact the appearance of new viral pathogens, how they may facilitate transmission between usual and novel hosts, and how they may also affect the host's ability to manage the infection. We emphasize how changes in temperature and humidity and other events associated with climate change influence the reservoirs of viral infections, their transmission by insects and other intermediates, their survival outside the host as well the success of infection in plants and animals. We conclude that climate change has mainly detrimental consequences for the emergence, transmission, and outcome of viral infections and plead the case for halting and hopefully reversing this dangerous event.

A single dose investigational subunit vaccine for human use against Nipah virus and Hendra virus								NPJ VACCINES				6	1					23	10.1038/s41541-021-00284-w				FEB 8 2021	2021	Nipah and Hendra viruses are highly pathogenic bat-borne paramyxoviruses recently included in the WHO Blueprint priority diseases list. A fully registered horse anti-Hendra virus subunit vaccine has been in use in Australia since 2012. Based on the same immunogen, the Hendra virus attachment glycoprotein ectodomain, a subunit vaccine formulation for use in people is now in a Phase I clinical trial. We report that a single dose vaccination regimen of this human vaccine formulation protects against otherwise lethal challenges of either Hendra or Nipah virus in a nonhuman primate model. The protection against the Nipah Bangladesh strain begins as soon as 7 days post immunization with low dose of 0.1 mg protein subunit. Our data suggest this human vaccine could be utilized as efficient emergency vaccine to disrupt potential spreading of Nipah disease in an outbreak setting.

To do this, I use an ecomimetic investigation of bats - selected because of their relationship to the COVID-19 pandemic - to explore the complexity of creaturely suffering in an interdependent world. Next, I offer an explanation of vulnerable suffering that is grounded in God's faithfulness to all of the creation that God called good. Rather than using this explanation to excuse human indifference to suffering, I argue that embracing one's creaturely finitude authorises constructive responses to suffering.

In the absence of vaccines or effective treatments, a better characterization of the pathogenesis of RSV infection is required. To date, the pathophysiology of the disease and its diagnosis has mostly relied on chest X-ray and genome detection in nasopharyngeal swabs. The development of new imaging approaches is instrumental to further the description of RSV spread, virus-host interactions and related acute respiratory disease, at the level of the entire lung. Methods: By combining tissue clearing, 3D microscopy and image processing, we developed a novel visualization tool of RSV infection in undissected mouse lungs. Results: Whole tissue analysis allowed the identification of infected cell subtypes, based on both morphological traits and position within the cellular network. Furthermore, 3D imaging was also valuable to detect the cytoplasmic viral factories, also called inclusion bodies, a hallmark of RSV infection. Conclusions: Whole lung clearing and 3D deep imaging represents an unprecedented visualization method of infected lungs to allow insight into RSV pathophysiology and improve the 2D histology analyses.

The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has become an urgent public health issue of global concern. It is speculated that the virus first emerged through a zoonotic spillover. Basic research studies have suggested that bats are likely the ancestral reservoir host. Nonetheless, the evolutionary history and host susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear as a multitude of animals has been proposed as potential intermediate or dead-end hosts. SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated from domestic animals, both companion and livestock, as well as in captive wildlife that were in close contact with human COVID-19 cases. Currently, domestic mink is the only known animal that is susceptible to a natural infection, develop severe illness, and can also transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other minks and humans. To improve foundational knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, we are conducting a synthesis review of its host diversity and transmission pathways. To mitigate this COVID-19 pandemic, we strongly advocate for a systems-oriented scientific approach that comprehensively evaluates the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at the human and animal interface.

Their glycoproteins form capsomeric projections or spikes on the virion surface and play a crucial role in virus entry, assembly, morphogenesis. Bunyavirus glycoproteins are encoded by a single RNA segment as a polyprotein precursor that is co- and post-translationally cleaved by host cell enzymes to yield two mature glycoproteins, Gn and Gc (or GP1 and GP2 in arenaviruses). These glycoproteins undergo extensive N-linked glycosylation and despite their cleavage, remain associated to the virion to form an integral transmembrane glycoprotein complex. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of bunyavirus glycoproteins, including their processing, structure, and known interactions with host factors that facilitate cell entry.

The Aging Bowel Dysfunction and Elderly Vulnerability towards COVID-19 Infection								LIFE-BASEL				11	2					97	10.3390/life11020097				FEB 2021	2021	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, primarily a respiratory tract virus, also affects the enteric organs. The most affected sector of the community are the retirement and nursing home elderly residents. Along their life the senescent gastrointestinal functions are deteriorating and failing to fully execute their digestive, absorptive, mucosal barriers, and immune protective duties. Adding the decreased motility, increased intestinal permeability, dysbiosis, morbid chronic disease background, the consumed polypharmacy enteric adverse effects to the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 host receptor along the intestinal tracts put the basis for the current hypothesis. It is hypothesized that the disadvantages and failures of the aging enteric tract contribute to the elderly morbidity and mortality during the current new coronavirus pandemic. In a more optimistic look, several nutraceuticals can prevent or restore the dysfunctional intestinal barrier functions, mainly in the elderly and potentially in those who are SARS-CoV-2 infected.

ACTA TROPICA				214						105778	10.1016/j.actatropica.2020.105778				FEB 2021	2021	We are living through an unprecedented crisis with the rapid spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) worldwide within a short time. The timely availability of thousands of SARS-CoV-2 genomes has enabled the scientific community to study the origin, structures, and pathogenesis of the virus. The pandemic has spurred research publication and resulted in an unprecedented number of therapeutic proposals. Because the development of new drugs is time consuming, several strategies, including drug repurposing and repositioning, are being tested to treat patients with COVID-19. Researchers have developed several potential vaccine candidates that have shown promise in phase II and III trials. As of 12 November 2020, 164 candidate vaccines are in preclinical evaluation, and 48 vaccines are in clinical evaluation, of which four have cleared phase III trials (Pfizer/Bio-NTech's BNT162b2, Moderna's mRNA-1273, University of Oxford & AstraZeneca's AZD1222, and Gamaleya's Sputnik V vaccine). Despite the acquisition of a vast body of scientific information, treatment depends only on the clinical management of the disease through supportive care. At the pandemic's 1-year mark, we summarize current information on SARS-CoV-2 origin and biology, and advances in the development of therapeutics. The updated information presented here provides a comprehensive report on the scientific progress made in the past year in understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology and therapeutics.

Mosquito-Borne Viruses and Non-Human Vertebrates in Australia: A Review								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	2					265	10.3390/v13020265				FEB 2021	2021	Mosquito-borne viruses are well recognized as a global public health burden amongst humans, but the effects on non-human vertebrates is rarely reported. Australia, houses a number of endemic mosquito-borne viruses, such as Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. In this review, we synthesize the current state of mosquito-borne viruses impacting non-human vertebrates in Australia, including diseases that could be introduced due to local mosquito distribution. Given the unique island biogeography of Australia and the endemism of vertebrate species (including macropods and monotremes), Australia is highly susceptible to foreign mosquito species becoming established, and mosquito-borne viruses becoming endemic alongside novel reservoirs. For each virus, we summarize the known geographic distribution, mosquito vectors, vertebrate hosts, clinical signs and treatments, and highlight the importance of including non-human vertebrates in the assessment of future disease outbreaks. The mosquito-borne viruses discussed can impact wildlife, livestock, and companion animals, causing significant changes to Australian ecology and economy. The complex nature of mosquito-borne disease, and challenges in assessing the impacts to non-human vertebrate species, makes this an important topic to periodically review.

SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the worldwide pandemic which has been taking place in 2020, and is causing a markedly higher number of infections and deaths compared to previous coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. Based on updated scientific literature, the present review compiles the most relevant knowledge of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 and the clinical and typical responses that patients have exhibited against this virus, discussing current and future therapies, and proposing strategies with which to combat the disease and prevent a further global threat. The aggressiveness of SARS-CoV-2 arises from its capacity to infect, and spread easily and rapidly through its tight interaction with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor. While not all patients respond in a similar manner and may even be asymptomatic, a wide range of manifestations associated with COVID-19 have been described, particularly in vulnerable population groups, such as the elderly or individuals with other underlying conditions. The proper function of the immune system plays a key role in an individual's favorable response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. A hyperactivated response, on the contrary, could account for the more severe cases of COVID-19, and this may finally lead to respiratory insufficiency and other complications, such as thrombotic or thromboembolic events. The development of novel therapies and vaccines designed to control and regulate a proper immune system response will be key to clinical management, prevention measures and effective population screening to attenuate the transmission of this novel RNA virus.

J	Wallis, Michael								Do some viruses use growth hormone, prolactin and their receptors to facilitate entry into cells? Episodic evolution of hormones and receptors suggests host-virus arms races; related placental lactogens may provide protective viral decoys								BIOESSAYS				43	4					e2000268	10.1002/bies.202000268		FEB 2021		APR 2021	2021	The molecular evolution of pituitary growth hormone and prolactin in mammals shows two unusual features: episodes of markedly accelerated evolution and, in some species, complex families of related proteins expressed in placenta and resulting from multiple gene duplications. Explanations of these phenomena in terms of physiological adaptations seem unconvincing. Here, I propose an alternative explanation, namely that these evolutionary features reflect the use of the hormones (and their receptors) as viral receptors. Episodes of rapid evolution can then be explained as due to "arms races" in which changes in the hormone lead to reduced interaction with the virus, and subsequent changes in the virus counteract this. Placental paralogues of the hormones could provide decoys that bind viruses, and protect the foetus against infection. The hypothesis implies that the extensive changes introduced into growth hormone, prolactin and their receptors during the course of mammalian evolution reflect viral interactions, not endocrine adaptations.

It was first reported in Wuhan and subsequently caused a global pandemic. The viral spike protein binds with the ACE-2 cell surface receptor for entry, while TMPRSS2 triggers its membrane fusion. In addition, RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 3 '-5 ' exoribonuclease (nsp14), viral proteases, N, and M proteins are important in different stages of viral replication. Accordingly, they are attractive targets for different antiviral therapeutic agents. Although many antiviral agents have been used in different clinical trials and included in different treatment protocols, the mode of action against SARS-CoV-2 is still not fully understood. Different potential repurposed drugs, including, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin, remdesivir, and favipiravir, were screened in the present study. Molecular docking of these drugs with different SARS-CoV-2 target proteins, including spike and membrane proteins, RdRp, nucleoproteins, viral proteases, and nsp14, was performed. Moreover, the binding affinities of the human ACE-2 receptor and TMPRSS2 to the different drugs were evaluated. Molecular dynamics simulation and MM-PBSA calculation were also conducted. Ivermectin and remdesivir were found to be the most promising drugs. Our results suggest that both these drugs utilize different mechanisms at the entry and post-entry stages and could be considered potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication.

Notably, all of these outbreaks have been linked to suspected zoonotic transmission of bat-borne viruses. Bats-the only flying mammal-display several additional features that are unique among mammals, such as a long lifespan relative to body size, a low rate of tumorigenesis and an exceptional ability to host viruses without presenting clinical disease. Here we discuss the mechanisms that underpin the host defence system and immune tolerance of bats, and their ramifications for human health and disease. Recent studies suggest that 64 million years of adaptive evolution have shaped the host defence system of bats to balance defence and tolerance, which has resulted in a unique ability to act as an ideal reservoir host for viruses. Lessons from the effective host defence of bats would help us to better understand viral evolution and to better predict, prevent and control future viral spillovers. Studying the mechanisms of immune tolerance in bats could lead to new approaches to improving human health. We strongly believe that it is time to focus on bats in research for the benefit of both bats and humankind.																					WOS:000609212900008	33473223

VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS				45	1			1	19		10.1007/s11259-021-09787-2		JAN 2021		FEB 2021	2021	Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute Respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has become unstoppable, spreading rapidly worldwide and, consequently, reaching a pandemic level. This review aims to provide the information available so far on the likely animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 and its possible hosts/reservoirs as well as all natural animal infections and experimental evidence using animal models. Horseshoe bats from the species Rhinolophus affinis seem to be a natural reservoir and pangolins (Manis javanica) appear to be an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. Humans remain the most likely spreading source of SARS-CoV-2 to other humans and also to domestic, zoo and farm animals. Indeed, human-to-animal transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions, a puma and minks. Animal-to-human transmission is not a sustained pathway, although mink-to-human transmission remains to be elucidated. Through experimental infections, other animals seem also to be susceptible hosts for SARS-CoV-2, namely ferrets, some non-human primate species, hamsters and transgenic mice, while dogs, pigs and poultry are resistant. A One Health perspective must be implemented in order to develop epidemiological surveillance and establish disease control mechanisms to limit zoonotic transmission. Moreover, research in this field is important to better understand SARS-CoV-2 and to obtain the long-awaited vaccine and specific treatment.																					WOS:000608930500001	33464439

Addressing the complex web of interrelated factors leading to zoonotic disease emergence and spread requires a transdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach, One Health. The One Health approach, which considers the linkages between the health of people, animals, and their shared environment, presents opportunities to reduce these impacts through a more holistic coordinated strategy to understanding and mitigating disease risks. Understanding the linkages between animal, human, and environmental health risks and outcomes is critical for developing early detection systems and risk reduction strategies to address known and novel zoonotic disease threats. Nearly 70 countries across the world, including Ghana, have signed on to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), which is facilitating multisectoral approaches to strengthen country capacities in the prevention and early detection of and respond to infectious disease threats. Currently, Ghana has not yet formalized a national One Health policy. The lack of a clearly defined multisectoral platform and limited collaboration among key Ghanaian Ministries, Departments, and Agencies has impacted the country's ability to effectively mitigate and respond to emerging and reemerging zoonoses. Many of these emerging zoonoses are caused by viruses, which, because of their diversity and evolutionary properties, are perceived to pose the greatest threat to global health security.

Bats in China moved to Jeju Island and/or Taiwan in the last 20,000 years via the Korean Peninsula and/or Japan. The phylogenies of host mitochondrial D-loop DNA was not significantly congruent with those of bat adenovirus (m(XY)(2) = 0.07, p = 0.08), and bat alphacoronavirus (m(XY)(2) = 0.48, p = 0.20). We estimate that the first divergence time of bats carrying bat adenovirus in five caves studied (designated as K1, K2, JJ, N2, and F3) occurred approximately 3.17 million years ago. In contrast, the first divergence time of bat adenovirus among bats in the 5 caves was estimated to be approximately 224.32 years ago. The first divergence time of bats in caves CH, JJ, WY, N2, F1, F2, and F3 harboring bat alphacoronavirus was estimated to be 1.59 million years ago. The first divergence time of bat alphacoronavirus among the 7 caves was estimated to be approximately 2,596.92 years ago. The origin of bat adenovirus remains unclear, whereas our findings suggest that bat alphacoronavirus originated in Japan. Surprisingly, bat adenovirus and bat alphacoronavirus appeared to diverge substantially over the last 100 years, even though our gene-flow data indicate that the eastern bent-winged bat serves as an important natural reservoir of both viruses.

J	Rahman, Md. Mahbubur; Mosaddik, Ashik; Alam, A. H. M. Khurshid								Traditional foods with their constituent's antiviral and immune system modulating properties								HELIYON				7	1					e05957	10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05957		JAN 2021		JAN 2021	2021	Background: Viruses are responsible for several diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome, a condition caused by today's pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A negotiated immune system is a common risk factor for all viral infections, including COVID-19. To date, no specific therapies or vaccines have been approved for coronavirus. In these circumstances, antiviral and immune boosting foods may ensure protection against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2 by reducing risk and ensuring fast healing of SARS-CoV-2 illness.Scope and approach: In this review, we have conducted an online search using several search engines (Google Scholar, PubMed, Web of Science and Science Direct) to find out some traditional foods (plant, animal and fungi species), which have antiviral and immune-boosting properties against numerous viral infections, particularly coronaviruses (CoVs) and others RNA-virus infections. Our review indicated some foods to be considered as potential immune enhancers, which may help individuals to overcome viral infections like COVID-19 by modulating immune systems and reducing respiratory problems. Furthermore, this review will provide information regarding biological properties of conventional foods and their ingredients to uphold general health.Key Findings and Conclusions: We observed some foods with antiviral and immune-boosting properties, which possess bioactive compounds that showed significant antiviral properties against different viruses, particularly RNA viruses such as CoVs. Interestingly, some antiviral and immune-boosting mechanisms were very much similar to the antiviral drug of COVID-19 homologous SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus). The transient nature and the devastating spreading capability of COVID-19 lead to ineffectiveness of many curative therapies. Therefore, body shielding and immune-modulating foods, which have previous scientific recognition, have been discussed in this review to discern the efficacy of these foods against viral infections, especially SARS-CoV-2.

Current Knowledge and Ecological and Human Impact Variables Involved in the Distribution of the Dengue Virus by Bats in the Americas								VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES				21	4			217	231		10.1089/vbz.2020.2696		JAN 2021		APR 1 2021	2021	Dengue fever, caused by the dengue virus (DENV), is one of the most important reemerging viral diseases transmitted by arthropods worldwide. DENV is maintained in nature in two transmission cycles: urban and sylvatic. The latter has only been recorded in Africa and Asia and involves nonhuman primates as natural hosts, although it has been suggested that other mammals may play a secondary role as potential reservoir host, including bats. The objective of this article is to review the current state of knowledge about DENV-positive bats in the Americas and to determine what ecological and human impact variables could favor DENV infection in bats. We performed a search of published studies on natural and experimental DENV infection in bats. From 1952 to 2019, 14 studies have been carried out (71.4% in the last decade) examining DENV infection in bats in seven countries of the Americas. DENV infection was examined in 1884 bats of 63 species and DENV was detected in 19 of these species. Clench's model estimated that more than 75 species could be carriers of DENV; therefore, considering that at least 350 species of bats are distributed in the Americas, to detect 95% of the DENV-bearing species, it would be necessary to examine about 10,206 bats of similar to 287 species that have not been analyzed until 2019. The species with the highest number of positive cases were Molossus sinaloae and Artibeus jamaicensis. Species, colony size, mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, human population size, and bat collection site (site inhabited by humans, vegetation cover, and caves) contributed to explain the variation in DENV detection in bats in the Americas. These results provide evidence on the exposure of bats to DENV in different geographic areas of the Americas and a bat sylvatic transmission cycle is very likely to be occurring, where bats may be either accidental hosts, dead-end hosts, or potential reservoir hosts for DENV.

Dose-dependent response to infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model and evidence of protective immunity								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				12	1					81	10.1038/s41467-020-20439-y				JAN 4 2021	2021	There is a vital need for authentic COVID-19 animal models to enable the pre-clinical evaluation of candidate vaccines and therapeutics. Here we report a dose titration study of SARS-CoV-2 in the ferret model. After a high (5x10(6)pfu) and medium (5x10(4)pfu) dose of virus is delivered, intranasally, viral RNA shedding in the upper respiratory tract (URT) is observed in 6/6 animals, however, only 1/6 ferrets show similar signs after low dose (5x10(2)pfu) challenge. Following sequential culls pathological signs of mild multifocal bronchopneumonia in approximately 5-15% of the lung is seen on day 3, in high and medium dosed groups. Ferrets re-challenged, after virus shedding ceased, are fully protected from acute lung pathology. The endpoints of URT viral RNA replication & distinct lung pathology are observed most consistently in the high dose group. This ferret model of SARS-CoV-2 infection presents a mild clinical disease. SARS-CoV-2 induces mild infection in ferret model. Here, Ryan et al. characterise optimal infection dosage inducing upper respiratory tract (UTR) viral shedding, progression time of viral shedding, and pathology in ferrets and finally provide evidence for protection after re-challenge.

These hormones can be triggered by some states, such as infections. Some illnesses that most likely have an influence on blood glucose levels include common cold or flu, COVID-19, bronchitis, or chest infections. So, it is important for diabetic patients affected by COVID-19 to eat a healthy balanced diet to maintain stable blood glucose levels and enhance their immune functions. The immune response has often been demonstrated to be attenuated by insufficient nutrition in many model systems as well as in human studies. We summarize and propose potential nutritional therapeutic options available for the treatment of this novel coronavirus in diabetic patients.																					WOS:000637940500007	33656714

Veterinarski Glasnik				75	1			33	41		10.2298/VETGL201217002A				2021	2021	Covid-19 has awakened the world to the importance of infectious diseases. However, it also affected several people, including researchers, as well as some organizations to blame the pandemic on intensive livestock production. Several factors contribute to the fact that the next pandemic is less likely to come from intensive livestock farming than from wild animals and traditional small-scale livestock production. However, there are also the facts that support the role of intensive production in spreading of diseases. One Health - the interaction between the health of humans, animals and the environment has received a lot of attention. Livestock production plays a role in these interactions, but is not a primary driver for the development of new pandemics.																					BCI:BCI202100621430

However, as human habitat expands and, in parallel, animal territory declines, new animal species can come into dangerous proximity, which may result in consequential transmission of microbes and different microbial behaviour in the new host. Presumably, this phenomenon led to the development of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which first appeared in humans in 2019 and infected millions over the course of a few months worldwide. All possible means must be used to combat the pandemic and prevent further epidemics, which will require cooperation between professionals in human medicine and veterinary medicine as well as in the ecological, evolutionary and environmental sciences, within the framework of the global "One Health". In a spirit of working together for common goals, the authors of this study, a veterinarian and a human physician, summarize the knowledge that may be relevant to both professions for SARS-CoV-2. The origin of the virus, its natural and artificial occurrence in different animal species, and experiences with animal coronaviruses that may contribute to the understanding of the functioning of SARS-CoV-2 and the development of protection against it are presented.

As of 11 August 2020, Ghana had recorded over 41,000 cases with over 215 deaths. This study seeks to provide a micro-level evidence on how COVID-19 is posing a threat to some of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly poverty in Ghana. Specifically, the study examined the effect of COVID-19 on poverty and living standards of Ghanaian households. The study further analysed which class of persons within the income distributions has been mostly hit by the pandemic. Data on 3,905 households were obtained via concurrent online survey and telephone interviews. Multiple analytical approaches were employed?Ordinary least squares, probit model and simultaneous quantile regressions. Results showed that COVID-19 had significantly increased the poverty levels of households while deteriorating living standards. The study also discovered that gender and locational heterogeneities exist regarding the impact of COVID-19 with females and rural dwellers mostly disadvantaged. However, simultaneous quantile regression result shows that in terms of overall household consumption, those in the middle and upper classes are profoundly affected compared to those in the lowest class. A key policy implication from this study is that Ghana needs to broaden its social protection programmes to assist both the new poor and existing poor.																					WOS:000617221000001

A dramatic increase in documented viral diversity in bats has occurred with an increasing difficulty in interpretation of results and risk assessments. In addition, the risk of spillover directly from bats or through other intermediate hosts is on the rise as human exposure results from habitat encroachment, human population expansion, deforestation and changes in climate and human behavior, such as increased bushmeat consumption, live animal markets, and cave exploration. The link between rabies and bats has been known for decades; however, there are many other viruses that also pose a threat with no prophylactic treatment or prevention measures existing yet. In addition, viruses have different routes of transmission and shedding may be seasonal. Our aim is to summarize what is known about important virus families implicated in zoonotic events with a bat origin. We include a discussion on potential immunological characteristics that allow bats to harbor many of these viruses without showing signs of disease and raise awareness on how to avoid exposure by considering different routes of exposure to infectious agents.

In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged from bats and was named SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses, and the disease it causes named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. Disease outbreaks such as SARS in 2002-2003, MERS in 2012 and the current COVID-19 pandemic are the result of higher mutation rates of coronaviruses and their unique capacity for genetic recombination, resulting in adaptations that make them more suitable to cross the species barriers and infect other species. This ability for host switching and interspecies infection is often attributed to the great diversity of these viruses, which is a result of viral and host factors such as the low fidelity of their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the high frequency of their homologous RNA recombination, and the adaptation of the S protein to bind host receptors like the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the case of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DDP4) in MERS-CoV. This review presents an overview of the zoonotic transmission of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, focusing on the viral, host and environmental factors that favor the spillover of these viruses into humans, as well as the biological and ecological factors that make bats the perfect animal reservoir of infection for these viruses.

The evolutionary origins of the virus remain elusive and understanding its complex mutational signatures could guide vaccine design and development. As part of the international "CoronaHack" in April 2020, we employed a collection of contemporary methodologies to compare the genomic sequences of coronaviruses isolated from human (SARS-CoV-2; n = 163), bat (bat-CoV; n = 215) and pangolin (pangolin-CoV; n = 7) available in public repositories. We have also noted the pangolin-CoV isolate MP789 to bare stronger resemblance to SARS-CoV-2 than other pangolin-CoV. Following de novo gene annotation prediction, analyses of gene-gene similarity network, codon usage bias and variant discovery were undertaken. Strong host-associated divergences were noted in ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF8 and S, and in codon usage bias profiles. Last, we have characterised several high impact variants (in-frame insertion/deletion or stop gain) in bat-CoV and pangolin-CoV populations, some of which are found in the same amino acid position and may be highlighting loci of potential functional relevance.

From this elementary immune response, the more complex antigen-specific adaptive responses are recruited to provide a long-lasting memory against the pathogens. Innate immunity gets activated when the host cell utilizes a diverse set of receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR) to recognize the viruses that have penetrated the host and responds with cellular processes like complement system, phagocytosis, cytokine release and inflammation and destruction of NK cells. Viral RNA or DNA or viral intermediate products are recognized by receptors like toll-like receptors(TLRs), nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) thereby, inducing type I interferon response (IFN) and other proinflammatory cytokines in infected cells or other immune cells. But certain viruses can evade the host innate immune response to replicate efficiently, triggering the spread of the viral infection. The present review describes the similarity in the mechanism chosen by viruses from different families -HIV, SARSCoV-2 and Nipah viruses to evade the innate immune response and how efficiently they establish the infection in the host. The review also addresses the stages of developments of various vaccines against these viral diseases and the challenges encountered by the researchers during vaccine development.

However, the increase in the human population, deforestation and climate change, and the rise in worldwide travel have favored the emergence of new viruses with the potential to cause pandemics. The ongoing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is a cruel reminder of the impact of novel pathogens and the suboptimal capabilities of conventional vaccines. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new vaccine strategies that allow the production of billions of doses in a short duration and are broadly protective against emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Extensive knowledge of the molecular biology and immunology of adenoviruses (Ad) has favored Ad vectors as platforms for vaccine design. The Ad-based vaccine platform represents an attractive strategy as it induces robust humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and can meet the global demand in a pandemic situation. This review describes the status of Ad vector-based vaccines in preclinical and clinical studies for current and emerging respiratory viruses, particularly coronaviruses, influenza viruses and respiratory syncytial viruses.

Because of its initial cases happened in a market specialized for sea food stuff that eat living creatures, it was verified as an infectious zoonotic disease. The first case was infected with SARS-CoV-2 was an old and infirm person suffering from symptoms on 1st December 2019. Neither of his family associates got infected, and his virus origin still unidentified. The persistence of Covid-19 pandemic may be another evidence of diseases coming out of the human-animal overlapping and disseminating through globe. Some reports proposed that bat birds and pangolins were the source of infection since coronavirus-development of such two animals undertook analogous genomic sequence for Covid-19. When Covid19 happens, many aspects shall be noticed and grasped like origin, innate hosts and intermediary hosts. Dipping down the vulnerability of disseminating from natural host to human-beings may be thoroughly requiring understanding of the natural environment of the pathogen.

The global COVID-19 outbreak started in Guangdong Province, China's southernmost province. The global response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by the sheer number of infected people, many of whom need intensive care before succumbing to the disease. The epidemic is being handled by a combination of disease control by public health interventions and compassionate treatment for those who have been impacted. There is no clear anti-COVID-19 medication available at this time. However, the need to find medications that can turn the tide has led to the development of a number of investigational drugs as potential candidates for improving outcomes, especially in the severely and critically ill. Although many of these adjunctive medications are still being studied in clinical trials, professional organizations have attempted to define the circumstances in which their use is deemed off-label or compassionate.

The nutrients in food have an important role in modulation of immune system, developing functional abilities and prevention of diseases along with maintaining our health, growth and development. The various components of functional foods are potentially beneficial components, found naturally in foods which help in prevention and reduction of risk factors for several diseases. These functional food components have immunomodulatory and antiviral properties which are of prime importance towards healthy immune system. The dietary supplementation of foods with functional food components like vitamins (A, B, C, and D), minerals (selenium, zinc, and iron) and phenolic compounds can act as treatment or preventive therapy for COVID-19 patients. The functional foods include foods fortified with above mentioned functional components along with the foods rich in these functional components like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, etc. These various functional food components like vitamins or minerals can be used as adjuvant in COVID-19 infected patients.

In patients with periodontal disease, there is an increase of Furin, Cathepsin, and CD14+ CD16+ monocytes. The hypothesis stated here sheds light on the regular need of periodontal management to reduce inflammation and the levels of deleterious host enzymes and cytokines, which could pave the way for deadly viral diseases such as COVID-19. The Hypothesis: Patients with periodontal disease are at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to elevated levels of Furin and Cathepsin in oral cavity and COVID-19 complications like cytokine storm could occur with increased frequency in patients with periodontal disease due to the significant increase of CD14+ CD16+ monocytes in blood. Evaluation of the Hypothesis: Oral and periodontal examination of patients with mild, moderate, and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection could shed light on the significant role played by periodontal disease in making an individual more prone to get SARS-CoV-2 infection by elevation of Furin and Cathepsin and the elevation of CD14+CD16+ monocytes and proinflammatory cytokines in the blood that could consequently worsen COVID-19 complications like cytokine storm. The blood counts of CD14+CD16+ monocytes need to be assayed in SARS-CoV-2 patients with and without periodontal disease to observe if periodontal disease as a coexisting condition elevates the proportion of CD14 CD16 + monocytes in SARS-CoV-2 patients. In fact, assessment of monocyte subsets in peripheral blood could be used as an immunosurveillance marker in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Hence, SARS-CoV-2 positive patients with chronic periodontal disease should be closely monitored for potential signs of a cytokine storm and its related complications.

Due to its high transmission and infection rate, it has spread around the world and has transformed into a ravaging global pandemic with enormously unprecedented impacts globally on human, social, and economic health. Just like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, there is no specific antiviral drug for its treatment. The only available therapeutics are supportive and symptom-based. Thus, scientists are harnessing various strategies to expedite drug development. One such approach is drug repurposing through computational screening of phytocompounds, which leverages proteins that are essential for the entry, replication, pathogenesis, assembly, and release of SARS-CoV-2. Here, we review the available literature on molecular docking of phytoligands against SARS-CoV-2 integral proteins, in a bid to update our current knowledge and identify the most promising molecules. The overwhelming majority of the promising lead compounds are either phenolics or terpenoids. Furthermore, of the elucidated SARS-CoV-2 targets, the main protease (3CL(pro)) appears as one of the most attractive druggable targets. Notably, compounds such as rutin, quercetin, luteolin, neoandrographolide, curcumin, and others with evident anti-inflammatory benefits, in addition to their predicted anti-SARS-CoV-2 properties, deserve further studies to validate their activity.

Previous experimental studies indicated that during viral infections, viral miRNAs (vmiRNAs) played key roles in pathogen-host interaction, immune escape, host cell death, and tumorigenesis. MiRNAs are small, single-stranded RNAs that exist in viruses as well as in animals. Thus, these molecules can play a pivotal role in viral disease pathogenesis.Objective: Since no approved drugs or vaccines currently exist for SARS-CoV-2 and its pathogenic mechanism is unknown, the present study aimed to explore and propose vmiRNA platforms as potential antiviral therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. The development of antiviral drugs to target vmiRNAs may result in the down-regulation of viral virulence genes expression and sup pression of viral proliferation.Methods: In this study, to attain insight into the potential role of SARS-CoV-2-derived miRNAs in viral infections, a set of computational methods was used to scan the SARS-CoV-2 genome, eventually predicting 13 potential candidate vmiRNAs. Furthermore, the potential genes were predicted in the human hosts that were the target of these candidate vmiRNAs by applying the mirPath software.Results: This study proposed a theory indicating that the predicted vmiRNAs might have a plausible role in altering human target gene expression, mainly contributing to a viral infectious state, inflammation, and immune system escape. These vmiRNAs might have therapeutic trends as antiviral agents against COVID-19 infection.Conclusion: The findings offered a reference idea for a supplementary study on miRNA identification as a drug target and revealed the necessity to increase the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 genome structure for a better combat against the virus.

In this study we have characterized the genetic lineage of SARS-CoV-2 and report the recombination within the genus and subgenus of coronaviruses. Phylogenetic relationship of thirty nine coronaviruses belonging to its four genera and five subgenera was analyzed by using the Neighbor-joining method using MEGA 6.0. Phylogenetic trees of full length genome, various proteins (spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) nucleotide sequences were constructed separately. Putative recombination was probed via RDP4. Our analysis describes that the “SARS-CoV-2” although shows great similarity to Bat-SARS-CoVs sequences through whole genome (giving sequence similarity 89%), exhibits conflicting grouping with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences (MG772933 and MG772934). Furthermore, seven recombination events were observed in SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) by RDP4. But not a single recombination event fulfills the high level of certainty. Recombination mostly housed in spike protein genes than rest of the genome indicating breakpoint cluster arises beyond the 95% and 99% breakpoint density intervals. Genetic similarity levels observed among “SARS-CoV-2” and Bat-SARS-CoVs advocated that the latter did not exhibit the specific variant that cause outbreak in humans, proposing a suggestion that “SARS-CoV-2” has originated possibly from bats. These genomic features and their probable association with virus characteristics along with virulence in humans require further consideration.		Resumo O novo coronavírus (nCoV), nomeadamente “SARS-CoV-2”, foi considerado responsável pela pandemia atual iniciada em Wuhan (China) desde dezembro de 2019 e foi descrito com ligação epidemiológica à China em cerca de 221 países e territórios até agora. Neste estudo, caracterizamos a linhagem genética do SARS-CoV-2 e relatamos a recombinação dentro do gênero e subgênero dos coronavírus. A relação filogenética de 39 coronavírus pertencentes a seus quatro gêneros e cinco subgêneros foi analisada usando o método de Neighbour-joining usando MEGA 6.0. Árvores filogenéticas do genoma de comprimento total, várias proteínas (espícula, envelope, membrana e nucleocapsídeo), sequências de nucleotídeos foram construídas separadamente. A recombinação putativa foi testada via RDP4. Nossa análise descreve que o “SARS-CoV-2”, embora mostre grande semelhança com as sequências de Bat-SARS-CoVs em todo o genoma (dando semelhança de sequência de 89%), exibe agrupamento conflitante com as sequências de coronavírus do tipo Bat-SARS (MG772933 e MG772934) Além disso, sete eventos de recombinação foram observados em SARS-CoV-2 (NC045512) por RDP4. Mas nem um único evento de recombinação preenche o alto nível de certeza. A recombinação está alojada mais em genes de proteína de pico, principalmente, do que no resto do genoma, indicando que o cluster de ponto de interrupção surge além dos intervalos de densidade de ponto de interrupção de 95% e 99%. Os níveis de similaridade genética observados entre “SARS-CoV-2” e Bat-SARS-CoVs defendem que o último não exibe a variante específica que causa surto em humanos, sugerindo que “SARS-CoV-2” tenha se originado possivelmente de morcegos. Essas características genômicas e sua provável associação com as características do vírus, juntamente com a virulência em humanos, requerem uma consideração mais aprofundada.

Detection of Rift Valley Fever virus inter-epidemic activity in Kilimanjaro Region, North Eastern Tanzania								GLOBAL HEALTH ACTION				14	1					1957554	10.1080/16549716.2021.1957554				JAN 1 2021	2021	Background Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus of public health impact infecting livestock, wildlife, and humans mainly in Africa and other parts of the world. Despite its public health importance, mechanisms of RVFV maintenance during interepidemic periods (IEPS) remain unclear. Objective We aimed to examine comparatively exposure to RVFV between humans and goats and RVFV infection between humans, goats and mosquitoes. Methods A cross sectional study was performed in the Lower Moshi area of the Kilimanjaro region from March to June 2020. RVFV exposure was determined by detecting IgG/IgM to RVFV using a competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay whereas infection was determined by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay. Results Results show that the male gender was related to RVFV seropositivity (chi(2) = 5.351; p=0.030). Being 50 years and above was related to seropositivity (chi(2) =14.430; p=0.006) whereas bed net use, larger numbers of persons living in the same house (>7 persons) and RVFV seropositivity in goats were related to higher seropositivity to RVFV among humans chi(2) =6.003; p=0.021, chi(2) =23.213; p < 0.001 and chi(2) =27.053; p < 0.001), respectively. By the use of RT-qPCR, goats exhibited the highest RVFV infection rate of 4.1%, followed by humans (2.6%), Ae. aegypti (2.3%), and Cx. pipiens complex(1.5%). Likewise, a higher proportion of goats (23.3%) were RVFV seropositive as compared with humans (13.2%). Conclusion Our findings suggest the Lower Moshi area as a potential hotspot for Rift Valley Fever (RVF), posing the danger of being a source of RVFV spread to other areas. Goats had the highest infection rate, suggesting goats as important hosts for virus maintenance during IEPs. We recommend the implementation of strategies that will warrant active RVF surveillance through the identification of RVF hotspots for targeted control of the disease.

Infection swiftly disseminates to gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, renal organs as well as immune system to deregulate their normal functioning through unique and distinct mechanisms. The health system and economy has been intensely thwarted by the rapid spread and exorbitant mortality caused by COVID-19 disease across the globe. The acute progression of the disease and high infection rate pose an enormous challenge for its therapeutic management and critical care. The viral structure, genome and proteome have been deciphered which yielded cues for targeting already available therapeutic entities. More than 200 compounds have been screened and till date approximately 69 therapeutic agents are undergoing clinical trials across the world. Among these, remedesivir (RMD), chloroquine (CQ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), noscapine (NOS) and heparin have demonstrated fairly promising results in preclinical and clinical studies. Recently, RMD has been approved by USFDA for the management of COVID 19. However, intense research is going on to screen and ace the 'magic bullets' for the management of SARS-CoV2 infection worldwide. The current review illustrates the plausible therapeutic targets in SARS-CoV2 important for inhibition of virus cycle. In addition, the role of RMD, CQ, HCQ, NOS and heparin in combating infection has been addressed. The importance of vitamin C and D supplements as adjunct therapies in the prevention of SARS-CoV2 virus infection have also been summarized.																					WOS:000604605600005	33227700	
J	Levesque, Danielle L.; Boyles, Justin G.; Downs, Cynthia J.; Breit, Ana M.								High Body Temperature Is an Unlikely Cause of High Viral Tolerance in Bats								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				57	1			238	241		10.7589/JWD-D-20-00079				JAN 2021	2021	The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the role of bats in zoonotic spillover have renewed interest in the flight-as-fever hypothesis, which posits that high body temperatures experienced by bats during flight contribute to their high viral tolerance. We argue that flight-as-fever is unlikely to explain why bats harbor more viruses than other mammals on the basis of two lines of reasoning. First, flight temperatures reported in the literature overestimate true flight temperatures because of methodologic limitations. Second, body temperatures in bats are only high relative to humans, and not relative to many other mammals. We provide examples of mammals from diverse habitats to show that temperatures in excess of 40 degrees C during activity are quite common in species with lower viral diversity than bats. We caution scientists against stating the flight-as-fever hypothesis as unquestioned truth, as has repeatedly occurred in the popular media in the wake of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

As of late August 2020, over 25 million persons had been infected, and we will see the global death toll exceed one million by the end of 2020. Both are minimum estimates. All segments of society have been drastically affected. Schools worldwide have been forced to close due to illness and absenteeism, transmission and risk to vulnerable members of the school community, and community concerns. The decision to reopen school during a pandemic will have a tremendous impact on children's safety, growth, and well-being. Not opening invites social isolation and suboptimal educational experiences, especially for youth whose computing assets and online access are limited and those with special needs. The opening has hazards as well, and the mitigation of these risks is the topic of this chapter. Opening schools requires careful considerations of benefits, risks, and precautions. Guiding principles for safety and strategic application of the principles in each educational niche are critical issues to consider during school reopening. The fundamental principles of disease control involve school directed initiatives (physical distancing and mask use, hand/face and surface cleansing, administrative controls, engineering controls) and individual-level risk reduction approaches to maximize adherence to new guidelines. The school-initiated "top-down" approaches and the individual-level "bottom-up" approaches must be synergized, as no single method will ensure safety. We discuss how to effectively layer strategies in each educational space to increase safety. Since the vulnerability of children has been heightened during this pandemic crisis, we highlight the special considerations for mental health support that should be considered by schools. The safety principles, disease control strategies, and other critical issues discussed here will serve as a starting point for developing a safe, comprehensive, and feasible reopening plan.

However, the origin and direct ancestral viruses of SARS-CoV-2 remain unknown. RaTG13, a novel coronavirus found in bats in China's Yunnan Province, is the closest relative virus of the SARS-CoV-2 identified so far. In this study, a new SARS-CoV-2 related virus, provisionally named PrC31, was discovered in Yunnan province by retrospectively analyse bat next generation sequencing (NGS) data of intestinal samples collected in 2018. PrC31 shared 90.7% and 92.0% nucleotide identities to the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and the bat SARSr-CoV ZC45, respectively. Sequence alignment of PrC31 showed that several genomic regions, especially orf1a and orf8 had the highest homology with those corresponding genomic regions of SARS-CoV-2 than any other related viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PrC31 shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 in evolutionary history. The differences between the PrC31 and SARS-CoV-2 genomes were mainly manifested in the spike genes. The amino acid homology between the receptor binding domains of PrC31 and SARS-CoV-2 was only 64.2%. Importantly, recombination analysis revealed that PrC31 underwent multiple complex recombination events (including three recombination breakpoints) involving the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 sub-lineages, indicating that PrC31 evolved from yet-to-be-identified intermediate recombination strains. Combined with previous studies, it is revealed that the beta-CoVs may possess a more complex recombination mechanism than we thought.																					WOS:000687850900001	34348599

In addition, they are the natural reservoirs of a variety of emerging or re-emerging zoonotic pathogens. Rhabdoviridae is one of the most diverse families of RNA viruses, which consists of 20 ecologically diverse genera, infecting plants, mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. To date, three bat-related genera are described, named Lyssavirus, Vesiculovirus, and Ledantevirus. However, the prevalence and the distribution of these bat-related rhabdoviruses remain largely unknown, especially in China. To fill this gap, we performed a large molecular retrospective study based on the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) detection of lyssavirus in bat samples (1044 brain and 3532 saliva samples, from 63 different bat species) originating from 21 provinces of China during 2006-2018. None of them were positive for lyssavirus, but six bat brains (0.6%) of Rhinolophus bat species, originating from Hubei and Hainan provinces, were positive for vesiculoviruses or ledanteviruses. Based on complete genomes, these viruses were phylogenetically classified into three putative new species, tentatively named Yinshui bat virus (YSBV), Taiyi bat virus (TYBV), and Qiongzhong bat virus (QZBV). These results indicate the novel rhabdoviruses circulated in different Chinese bat populations.																					WOS:000611850400001	33466539

While SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated from a natural wildlife reservoir, neither the immediate viral precursor nor the reservoir or intermediate hosts have been identified conclusively. Due to its zoonotic origin, SARS-CoV-2 may also be relevant to animals. Thus, to evaluate the host range of the virus and to assess the risk to act as potential animal reservoir, a large number of different animal species were experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2 or monitored in the field in the last months. In this review, we provide an update on studies describing permissive and resistant animal species. Using a scoring system based on viral genome detection subsequent to SARS-CoV-2 inoculation, seroconversion, the development of clinical signs and transmission to conspecifics or humans, the susceptibility of diverse animal species was classified on a semi-quantitative scale. While major livestock species such as pigs, cattle and poultry are mostly resistant, companion animals appear moderately susceptible, while several model animal species used in research, including several Cricetidae species and non-human primates, are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. By natural infections, it became obvious that American minks (Neovison vison) in fur farms, e.g., in the Netherlands and Denmark are highly susceptible resulting in local epidemics in these animals.

Due to unavailable specific drugs for this virus, there is an urgent need for supportive cares. Epigenetic immune boosting approaches and developing anti-inflammatory agents by gut-associated bioactive macronutrients can be plausible protective cares for COVID-19. Suitable intake of bioactive macronutrients including prebiotics, fatty acids, proteins and branched-chain amino acids may result in anti-viral responses through modulating macrophages and dendritic cells via Toll-like receptors, decreasing viral load, inactivating the enveloped viruses, increasing the anti-inflammatory metabolites and inhibiting the proliferation of microbial organisms. Bioactive macronutrients may help in promotion of immunological responses and recovery acceleration against Covid-19. This review focuses on the mechanisms of bioactive macronutrients and related clinical trials on enveloped viruses with emphasis on gut-microbiome-immune axis.

Numerous studies have been published since the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak began in Wuhan, China. Most have focused on virology, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and therapeutic medicine, having been centered by reactive strategies to control the pandemic. Meanwhile, publications addressing the ecological, evolutionary, and anthropogenic drivers of virus emergence, and potential strategies to prevent future outbreaks have been sparse. Here, we highlight the necessity of complementary and transdisciplinary insight and methodologies from an integrated perspective to study emergent diseases. It is paramount to situate the consistently associated factors to understand the complexity of the current pandemic. Disease ecology can examine information to recognize the causes of emergence while appraising the role of interactions among pathogens, domestic animals, wildlife, and humans, integratively. Here we draw on a variety of disciplines and perspectives, from evolutionary biology, biogeography, ecology, molecular epidemiology and integrative health, to address the emergence of coronaviruses, with particular emphasis on SARS-CoV-2. We describe the process of the surfacing of zoonotic diseases, highlighting the interactions among wildlife, domestic animals, and humans, as well as the genetic, evolutionary, ecological, and anthropogenic processes that favor coronavirus epidemics and epizootics. We discuss specific results related to coronavirus investigations conducted in Mexico based on disease ecology methodologies. Finally, we describe alternative approaches for understanding and preventing future outbreaks and we suggest strategies to entice integrative and transdisciplinary research within the One Health/Ecohealth paradigm.

Susceptibility of Domestic Swine to Experimental Infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2								EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES				27	1			104	112		10.3201/eid2701.203399				JAN 2021	2021	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the agent that causes coronavirus disease, has been shown to infect several species. The role of domestic livestock and associated risks for humans in close contact with food production animals remains unknown for many species. Determining the susceptibility of pigs to SARS-CoV-2 is critical to a One Health approach to manage potential risk for zoonotic transmission. We found that pigs are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 after oronasal inoculation. Among 16 animals, we detected viral RNA in group oral fluids and in nasal wash from 2 pigs, but live virus was isolated from only 1 pig. Antibodies also were detected in only 2 animals at 11 and 13 days postinoculation but were detected in oral fluid samples at 6 days postinoculation, indicating antibody secretion. These data highlight the need for additional livestock assessment to determine the potential role of domestic animals in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.																					WOS:000609135300012	33350904

The differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), and microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified by edgeR, and the SARS-CoV-2-associated competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network was con-structed based on the prediction of bioinformatic databases. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted with the SARS-CoV-2-related DEmRNAs, and the protein-protein interaction network was also built basing on STRING database. The ROC analysis was performed for assessing the diagnostic efficiency of hub genes.Results: The results indicated that SARS-CoV-2-related DEmRNAs were associated with the interferon signaling pathway and other antiviral processes, such as IFNL3, IFNL1 and CH25H. Our analysis suggested that lncRNA NEAT1 might regulate the host immune response through two miRNAs, hsa-miR-374-5p and hsa-miR-155-5p, which control the expression of SOCS1, IL6, IL1B, CSF1R, CD274, TLR6, and TNF. Additionally, IFI6, HRASLS2, IGFBP4 and PTN may be potential targets based on an analysis comparing the transcriptional responses of SARS-CoV-2 infection with that of other respiratory viruses.Discussion: The unique ceRNA network identified potential non-coding RNAs and their possible targets as well as a new perspective to understand the molecular mechanisms of the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2. This study may also aid in the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.																					WOS:000707447300003	34675627

To investigate the possible role of bats as part of SARS-CoV-2 anthropozoo-notic spill-over infections in Egypt, a total of 800 samples obtained from 200 Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative RT-PCR assay (RT-qPCR). RT-qPCR analysis of RNA extracted from bat tissues showed no positive results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. These findings suggest that during the study period, the Rousettus aegyptiacus bat was not a reservoir or amplifying host for SARS-CoV-2 infection in Egypt. The lack of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid in Egyptian fruit bats is thought to make a significant contribution to SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.																					WOS:000712621200001	34796231

As the disease is quickly developing into a worldwide pandemic, a careful analysis of its origin, evolution, transmission, and cellular mechanism is urgently needed to combat the deadly virus. Successful isolation of the 2019-nCoV has promoted some bioinformatic studies to understand the viral origin and the feature of its infectivity. However, at this stage, much remains unclear about the origin of the novel virus and to be investigated to develop ways to control its spread. The mechanisms associated with the infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 are not entirely understood. The current knowledge in 2019-nCoV pathogenicity and transmissibility along with several commonly known emerging viruses and information is very much important for better control of the disease. So far, the treatment is only supportive. Any antiviral agent is yet to emerge. The scientific community raced to understand the pathogenesis of the disease for developing treatment options. Extensive research is going on to understand the host response to the pandemic virus to develop the disease therapeutic. To fill the knowledge gap about the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infections that may help in designing the appropriate immune intervention for treatment, diagnosis, and prophylactic/therapeutic vaccines against COVID-19, we present hereby a brief review on the genomic organization, origin, and evolution, transmission and pathogenesis of the novel virus, and clinical spectrum and possible preventive measures against COVID-19 which may be used for future references.

Since its first isolation in Africa in 1937, WNV had been considered a neglected pathogen until its recent spread throughout Europe and the colonization of America, regions where it continues to cause outbreaks with severe neurological consequences in humans and horses. Although our knowledge about the characteristics and consequences of the virus has increased enormously lately, many questions remain to be resolved. Here, we thoroughly update our knowledge of different aspects of the WNV life cycle: virology and molecular classification, host cell interactions, transmission dynamics, host range, epidemiology and surveillance, immune response, clinical presentations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prophylaxis (antivirals and vaccines), and prevention, and we highlight those aspects that are still unknown and that undoubtedly require further investigation.

J	Uelmen, Johnny A.; Irwin, Patrick; Bartlett, Dan; Brown, William; Karki, Surendra; Ruiz, Marilyn O'Hara; Fraterrigo, Jennifer; Li, Bo; Smith, Rebecca L.								Effects of Scale on Modeling West Nile Virus Disease Risk								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				104	1			151	165		10.4269/ajtmh.20-0416				JAN 2021	2021	Modeling vector-borne diseases is best conducted when heterogeneity among interacting biotic and abiotic processes is captured. However, the successful integration of these complex processes is difficult, hindered by a lack of understanding of how these relationships influence disease transmission across varying scales. West Nile virus (WNV) is the most important mosquito-borne disease in the United States. Vectored by Culex mosquitoes and maintained in the environment by avian hosts, the virus can spill over into humans and horses, sometimes causing severe neuroinvasive illness. Several modeling studies have evaluated drivers of WNV disease risk, but nearly all have done so at broad scales and have reported mixed results of the effects of common explanatory variables. As a result, fine-scale relationships with common explanatory variables, particularly climatic, socioeconomic, and human demographic, remain uncertain across varying spatial extents. Using an interdisciplinary approach and an ongoing 12-year study of the Chicago region, this study evaluated the factors explaining WNV disease risk at high spatiotemporal resolution, comparing the human WNV model and covariate performance across three increasing spatial extents: ultrafine, local, and county scales. Our results demonstrate that as spatial extent increased, model performance increased. In addition, only six of the 23 assessed covariates were included in best-fit models of at least two scales. These results suggest that the mechanisms driving WNV ecology are scale-dependent and covariate importance increases as extent decreases. These tools may be particularly helpful for public health, mosquito, and disease control personnel in predicting and preventing disease within local and fine-scale jurisdictions, before spillover occurs.

NiV has infected many animals and humans worldwide and a huge loss to life has been faced. NiV contains a Fusion protein on its outer membrane which helps in the virus entry into the host cell. This fusion protein is a virulent factor and is a major anti-viral target. Many medicinal plants have been used against viral diseases, current research aims towards the potential of three daily dietary food elements that can be used as an anti-viral agent. In-silico studies are performed with 4-hyroxypanduratin A, 6-gingerol and Luteolin against the NiV-F and binding energies were calculated. It was reported that these phyto-compounds have good negative binding energies and they have the promising potential against Nipah Virus. Further in-vitro research can be performed with these phyto-compounds to design a specific drug against Nipah Virus.																					WOS:000711143300045		
J	Villegas, Gonzalo; Leon, Daphne; Falcon, Nestor								Risk of infection of COVID-19 in pets from the perspective of their owners in Lima, Peru								REVISTA DE INVESTIGACIONES VETERINARIAS DEL PERU				32	5					e21349	10.15381/rivep.v32i5.21349				2021	2021	The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of pet owners about the risk of infection of their pets with COVID-19 in Lima, Peru. A virtual survey was prepared for clients of private veterinary services in Metropolitan Lima. The instrument collected demographic information, knowledge about the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, cases of human infection, handling of the pet during the pandemic and perception of the risk of infection of animals by COVID-19. The survey was answered by 408 pet owners. It was recognized that the main means of transmission of COVID-19 were infected people (93.6%). Respiratory problems were rarely observed in dogs (8.1%) and cats (2.2%). The majority perception of those surveyed was not to relate the respiratory problems of pets with COVID-19 (80.6%), but they showed concern for the affected health of their animal (79.7%). The practice of walking the pets was carried out more than once a day (38.1%), being more frequent not using protection for the animals (65.4%). The walk generally lasted between 10 to 20 minutes (45.4%), and around the block (46.2%) and in parks (36.0%). Hygiene and prevention measures taken after the walk were bathing and washing of paws (73.4%) in pets, and a combination of measures that included social distancing (80.4%), use of personal protective equipment (79.7%) and use of alcohol / disinfectant (60.8%), in the owners. The study shows a low perception of the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from humans to pets, a knowledge that must be reinforced by health authorities to safeguard the human-animal relationship based on responsible pet ownership practices.

The conventional 'one drug, one virus' paradigm for antivirals does not adequately allow for proper preparedness in the face of unknown future epidemics. In addition, drug developers lack the financial incentives to work on antiviral drug discovery, with most pharmaceutical companies choosing to focus on more profitable disease areas. Safe-in-man broad spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) can help meet the need for antiviral development by already having passed phase I clinical trials, requiring less time and money to develop, and having the capacity to work against many viruses, allowing for a speedy response when unforeseen epidemics arise. In this chapter, we discuss the benefits of repurposing existing drugs as BSAAs, describe the major steps in safe-in-man BSAA drug development from discovery through clinical trials, and list several database resources that are useful tools for antiviral drug repositioning.

J	Lewis, Charles E.; Pickering, Bradley								Livestock and Risk Group 4 Pathogens: Researching Zoonotic Threats to Public Health and Agriculture in Maximum Containment								ILAR JOURNAL				61	1			86	102		10.1093/ilar/ilab029				DEC 30 2020	2020	Maximum-containment laboratories are a unique and essential component of the bioeconomy of the United States. These facilities play a critical role in the national infrastructure, supporting research on a select set of especially dangerous pathogens, as well as novel, emerging diseases. Understanding the ecology, biology, and pathology at the human-animal interface of zoonotic spillover events is fundamental to efficient control and elimination of disease. The use of animals as human surrogate models or as target-host models in research is an integral part of unraveling the interrelated components involved in these dynamic systems. These models can prove vitally important in determining both viral- and host-factors associated with virus transmission, providing invaluable information that can be developed into better risk mitigation strategies. In this article, we focus on the use of livestock in maximum-containment, biosafety level-4 agriculture (BSL-4Ag) research involving zoonotic, risk group 4 pathogens and we provide an overview of historical associated research and contributions. Livestock are most commonly used as target-host models in high-consequence, maximum-containment research and are routinely used to establish data to assist in risk assessments. This article highlights the importance of animal use, insights gained, and how this type of research is essential for protecting animal health, food security, and the agriculture economy, as well as human public health in the face of emerging zoonotic pathogens. The utilization of animal models in high-consequence pathogen research and continued expansion to include available species of agricultural importance is essential to deciphering the ecology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as for emergency response and mitigation preparedness.

J	Latif, Abdalla A.; Mukaratirwa, Samson								Zoonotic origins and animal hosts of coronaviruses causing human disease pandemics: A review								ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH				87	1					a1895	10.4102/ojvr.v87i1.1895				DEC 21 2020	2020	The first known severe disease caused by a coronavirus (CoV) in humans emerged with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China, which killed 774 people during its 2002/2003 outbreak. The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was the second human fatal disease, which started in 2012 in Saudi Arabia and resulted in 858 fatalities. In December 2019, a new virus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), originating from China, began generating headlines worldwide because of the unprecedented speed of its transmission; 5.2 million people were infected and 338 480 had been reported dead from December 2019 to May 2020. These human coronaviruses are believed to have an animal origin and had reached humans through species jump. Coronaviruses are well known for their high frequency of recombination and high mutation rates, allowing them to adapt to new hosts and ecological niches. This review summarises existing information on what is currently known on the role of wild and domesticated animals and discussions on whether they are the natural reservoir/amplifiers hosts or incidental hosts of CoVs. Results of experimental infection and transmission using different wild, domesticated and pet animals are also reviewed. The need for a One Health approach in implementing measures and practices is highlighted to improve human health and reduce the emergence of pandemics from these zoonotic viruses.

Mutational spectra of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animals								PEERJ				8						e10609	10.7717/peerj.10609				DEC 18 2020	2020	Coronaviruses are ubiquitous and infect a wide spectrum of animals and humans. The newly emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a worldwide pandemic. To address the role that animals may play in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, the full genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from animals were compared with SARS-CoV-2 human isolates from the same Glade and geographic region. Phylogenetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from the cat, dog, mink, mouse, and tiger revealed a close relationship with SARS-CoV-2 human isolates from the same Glade and geographic region with sequence identities of 99.94-99.99%. The deduced amino acid sequence of spike (S) protein revealed the presence of a furin cleavage site, ((682)RRAR del(685))which did not differ among all SARS-CoV-2 isolates from animals and humans. SARS-CoV-2 isolates from minks exhibited two amino acid substitutions (G261D, A262S) in the N-terminal domain of S protein and four (L452M, Y453F, F486L, N501T) in the receptor-binding motif (RBM). In the mouse, the S protein had two amino acid substitutions, one in the RBM (Q498H) and the other (N969S) in the heptad repeat 1. SARS-CoV-2 isolated from minks ftirtherly exhibited three unique amino acid substitutions in the nucleocapsid (N)protein. In the cat, two unique amino acid substitutions were discovered in the N (T247I) and matrix (T175M) proteins. Additionally, SARS-CoV-2 isolated from minks possessed sixteen, four, and two unique amino acid substitutions in the open reading frame lab (ORF lab), ORF3a, and ORF6, respectively. Dog and cat SARS-CoV-2 isolates showed one and seven unique amino acid substitutions in ORFlab, respectively. Further studies may be necessary to determine the pathogenic significance of these amino acid substitutions to understand the molecular epidemiology and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

The primary target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the human lungs governed by the ACE-2 receptor of epithelial type II cells/endothelial cells, which promote modulation of the immune response of host cells through generating cytokine storm, inflammation, severe pneumonia symptoms, and secondary complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. Although numerous antiviral and anti parasitic drugs are under clinical trials to combat this pandemic, to date, neither a specific treatment nor any successful vaccine has been established, urging researchers to identify any potential candidate for combating the disease. Mesenchymal stem cells own self-renewal, differentiation, homing, immunomodulation and remains unaffected by the coronavirus on the virtue of the absence of ACE-2 receptors, indicating that MSC's could be used an ameliorative approach for COVID-19. MSCs have shown to combat the disease via various pathways such as repairing the lung epithelial and endothelial cells, reducing hyperimmune response, maintaining the reninangiotensin system. Although MSCs-based treatment approaches for COVID-19 is still under consideration with limited data, many human clinical trials of MSC's has been initiated to explore their potential for COVID 19 treatment. The current review summarizes and emphasizes on how MSC's modulate the immune response, can repair the lungs from the impact of the virus, and various aspects of MSC's as a remedial source for COVID-19, to provide better insight for biomedical researchers and for those who are fascinated by stem cells as a therapeutic approach.

The human IFN system and its functionality has already been largely characterized and studied in detail. However, the IFN systems of bats have only been marginally examined to date up until the recent developments of the Bat1k project which have now opened new opportunities in research by identifying six new bat genomes to possess novel genes that are likely associated with viral tolerance exhibited in bats. Interestingly, bats have been hypothesized to possess the ability to establish a host-virus relationship where despite being infected, they exhibit limited signs of disease and still retain the ability to transmit the disease into other susceptible hosts. Bats are one of the most abundant and widespread vertebrates on the planet and host many zoonotic viruses that are highly pathogenic to humans. Several genomics, immunological, and biological features are thought to underlie novel antiviral mechanisms of bats. This review aims to explore the bat IFN system and developments in its diverse IFN features, focusing mainly on the model species, the Australian black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), while also highlighting bat innate immunity as an exciting and fruitful area of research to understand their ability to control viral-mediated pathogenesis.

Due to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide, it has been announced as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Hospitalized patients in Wuhan were associated with the Huanan seafood wholesale market where live animals, such as poultry, bats, snakes, frogs, rabbits, marmots, and hedgehogs are sold in that market which suggests a possible zoonotic infection. It was suggested that bat is the natural host of SARS-CoV-2, but the intermediate host is still unclear. It is essential to identify the potential intermediate host to interrupt the transmission chain of the virus. Pangolin is a highly suspected candidate as an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 infection has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, and lions. More recently SARS-CoV-2 infection affected minks severely and zoonotic transfer with a variant SARS-CoV-2 strain evidenced in Denmark, Netherlands, USA, and Spain suggesting animal-to-human and animal-to-animal transmission within mink farms. Furthermore, experimental studies documented the susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2, such as mice, golden hamsters, cats, ferrets, non-human primates, and treeshrews. It is also essential to know the possibility of infection for other animal species. This short review aims to provide an overview on the relation between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and animals.

RSV vaccines are currently unavailable, and children suffering from multiple reinfections by the same viral strain fail to develop protective responses. Although RSV-specific antibodies can be detected upon infection, these have limited neutralizing capacity. Follicular helper T (Tfh) cells are specialized in providing signals to B cells and help the production and affinity maturation of antibodies, mainly via interleukin (IL) 21 secretion. In this study, we evaluated whether RSV could inhibit Tfh responses. We observed that Tfh cells fail to upregulate IL-21 production upon RSV infection. In the lungs, RSV infection downregulated the expression of IL-21/interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) in Tfh cells and upregulated programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells. PD-L1 blockade during infection recovered IL-21R expression in Tfh cells and increased the secretion of IL-21 in a DC-dependent manner. IL-21 treatment decreased RSV viral load and lung inflammation, inducing the formation of tertiary lymphoid organs in the lung. It also decreased regulatory follicular T cells, and increased Tfh cells, B cells, antibody avidity and neutralization capacity, leading to an overall improved anti-RSV humoral response in infected mice. Passive immunization with purified immunoglobulin G from IL-21-treated RSV-infected mice protected against RSV infection. Our results unveil a pathway by which RSV affects Tfh cells by increasing PD-L1 expression on antigen-presenting cells, highlighting the importance of an IL-21-PD-L1 axis for the generation of protective responses to RSV infection.

Evidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in cats and dogs from households in Italy								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				11	1					6231	10.1038/s41467-020-20097-0				DEC 4 2020	2020	SARS-CoV-2 emerged from animals and is now easily transmitted between people. Sporadic detection of natural cases in animals alongside successful experimental infections of pets, such as cats, ferrets and dogs, raises questions about the susceptibility of animals under natural conditions of pet ownership. Here, we report a large-scale study to assess SARS-CoV-2 infection in 919 companion animals living in northern Italy, sampled at a time of frequent human infection. No animals tested PCR positive. However, 3.3% of dogs and 5.8% of cats had measurable SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers, with dogs from COVID-19 positive households being significantly more likely to test positive than those from COVID-19 negative households. Understanding risk factors associated with this and their potential to infect other species requires urgent investigation. SARS-CoV-2 can infect cats and dogs, but the extent to which pets are infected in households remains unclear. Here, Patterson et al. test 919 companion animals in northern Italy and find that some dogs and cats from COVID-19 positive households can test positive for COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies, with dogs significantly more likely to do so if they came from COVID-19 positive households.

Exposure to Zoonotic West Nile Virus in Long-Tailed Macaques and Bats in Peninsular Malaysia								ANIMALS				10	12					2367	10.3390/ani10122367				DEC 2020	2020	Simple SummaryThe role of wildlife animals, such as macaques and bats, in the spreading and maintenance of deadly zoonotic pathogens in nature are documented in several studies. The present study substantially highlights the first evidence of West Nile Virus (WNV) infection, a mosquito borne virus in the Malaysian macaques and bats. Of the 81 macaques sampled, 24 of the long-tailed macaques were seropositive to WNV, indicating that they were exposed to the virus in the past. The long-tailed macaques were found in the mangrove forests located in the Central, Southern, and West Peninsular Malaysia. Meanwhile, five out of 41 bats (Lesser Short-nosed Fruit Bats, Lesser Sheath-tailed Bats, and Thai Horseshoe Bats) that were found in the caves from Northern Peninsular Malaysia showed susceptibility to WNV. Therefore, a constant bio surveillance of WNV in the wildlife in Malaysia is a proactive attempt. This study was aligned with the Malaysian government's mission under the Malaysia Strategy for Emerging Diseases and Public Health Emergencies (MYSED) II (2017-2021) and the Ministry of Health priorities in order to enhance the regional capability to rapidly and accurately survey, detect, diagnose, and report outbreaks of pathogens and diseases of security concern.The role of wildlife such as wild birds, macaques, and bats in the spreading and maintenance of deadly zoonotic pathogens in nature have been well documented in many parts of the world. One such pathogen is the mosquitoes borne virus, namely the West Nile Virus (WNV). Previous research has shown that 1:7 and 1:6 Malaysian wild birds are WNV antibody and RNA positive, respectively, and bats in North America may not be susceptible to the WNV infection. This study was conducted to determine the status of WNV in Malaysian macaques and bats found in mangrove forests and caves, respectively. Archive sera and oropharyngeal swabs from long-tailed macaques were subjected to the antibody detection using WNV competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and WNV RNA using RT-PCR, respectively, while the archive oropharyngeal and rectal swabs from bats were subjected to RT-PCR without serological analysis due to the unavailability of serum samples. The analysis revealed a WNV seropositivity of 29.63% (24/81) and none of the macaques were positive for WNV RNA. Meanwhile, 12.2% (5/41) of the bats from Pteropodidae, Emballonuridae, and Rhinolophidae families tested positive for WNV RNA. Here, we show a high WNV antibody prevalence in macaques and a moderate WNV RNA in various Malaysian bat species, suggesting that WNV circulates through Malaysian wild animals and Malaysian bat species may be susceptible to the WNV infection.

Lectins are natural proteins with the ability to bind specific carbohydrates related to various microorganisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites. Lectins have the ability to agglutinate and neutralize these pathogeneses. The delivery of the encapsulated antiviral agents or vaccines across the cell membrane can be possible by functionalized micellar and liposomal formulations. In this mini-review, recent advances and challenges related to important lectins with inhibition activities against coronaviruses are presented to obtain a novel viewpoint of microformulations or nanoformulations by micellar and liposomal cell-binding carriers.

Experimental Lagos bat virus infection in straw-colored fruit bats: A suitable model for bat rabies in a natural reservoir species								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				14	12					e0008898	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008898				DEC 2020	2020	Rabies is a fatal neurologic disease caused by lyssavirus infection. Bats are important natural reservoir hosts of various lyssaviruses that can be transmitted to people. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of rabies in bats are poorly understood, making it difficult to prevent zoonotic transmission. To further our understanding of lyssavirus pathogenesis in a natural bat host, an experimental model using straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and Lagos bat virus, an endemic lyssavirus in this species, was developed. To determine the lowest viral dose resulting in 100% productive infection, bats in five groups (four bats per group) were inoculated intramuscularly with one of five doses, ranging from 10(0.1) to 10(4.1) median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). More bats died due to the development of rabies after the middle dose (10(2.1) TCID50, 4/4 bats) than after lower (10(1.1), 2/4; 10(1.1), 2/4) or higher (10(3.1), 2/4; 10(4.1), 2/4) doses of virus. In the two highest dose groups, 4/8 bats developed rabies. Of those bats that remained healthy 3/4 bats seroconverted, suggesting that high antigen loads can trigger a strong immune response that abrogates a productive infection. In contrast, in the two lowest dose groups, 3/8 bats developed rabies, 1/8 remained healthy and seroconverted and 4/8 bats remained healthy and did not seroconvert, suggesting these doses are too low to reliably induce infection. The main lesion in all clinically affected bats was meningoencephalitis associated with lyssavirus-positive neurons. Lyssavirus antigen was detected in tongue epithelium (5/11 infected bats) rather than in salivary gland epithelium (0/11), suggesting viral excretion via the tongue. Thus, intramuscular inoculation of 10(2.1) TCID50 of Lagos bat virus into straw-colored fruit bats is a suitable model for lyssavirus associated bat rabies in a natural reservoir host, and can help with the investigation of lyssavirus infection dynamics in bats.Author summaryRabies is a fatal neurologic disease affecting people and animals. Rabies is caused by infection with a virus of the genus Lyssavirus. People usually get infected from dog bites, but bats are an increasingly important source of the disease. To better understand the biology of rabies in bats, we developed a laboratory model to study the disease in bats under controlled circumstances. For this model we used Lagos bat virus in straw-colored fruit bats and, as part of its development, we wanted to know the best virus dose to use to cause rabies. Therefore, we compared the outcomes of five different virus doses injected into the muscle of the bats. The best dose for our model was the middle dose, which caused rabies more frequently than either the highest or the lowest doses. The higher doses more frequently resulted in the development of an anti-viral immune response which appeared to protect against disease, while bats with low doses also often failed to develop disease. The virus dose thus followed the Goldilocks principle, with the middle dose being just right.																					WOS:000600200300006	33320860

Ecology of bats and their role in emerging zoonotic diseases: a review								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				39	3			1077	1090		10.20506/rst.39.3.3198				DEC 2020	2020	The order Chiroptera is the second largest order of mammals and shows great physiological and ecological diversity. These animals play significant ecological roles as prey and predator as well as facilitating pollination, seed dispersal, arthropod reduction and nutrient distribution and reutilisation in nature. Bats act as hosts to a range of viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic zoonoses. Human activities increase the likelihood of exposure to bats, thereby increasing the opportunity for infections to spill over. Continuing ecological processes, emergence and spillover of novel pathogens in naive hosts, including humans, along with other complex natural phenomena require proper understanding that may help in predicting the next spillover. This review will discuss the ecology of bats and their role in the emergence of different zoonoses, particularly those of viral origin, in an organised manner to increase understanding of the factors that may play significant roles in spillover of these pathogens from bats to other animals, including humans.

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic represents a potential threat to patients and healthcare systems worldwide. Patients with the worst outcomes and higher mortality are reported to include older adults, polymorbid individuals, and malnourished people in general. The purpose of this review is to provide concise guidance for the nutritional management of individuals with COVID-19 based on the current literature and focused on those in the non-ICU setting or with an older age and polymorbidity, which are independently associated with malnutrition and its negative impact on mortality.Recent FindingsProlonged hospital stays are reported to be required for individuals with COVID-19, and longer acute setting stays may directly worsen or cause malnutrition, with severe loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, which may lead to poor quality of life and additional morbidity. Nutritional therapy is among the mainstay of therapeutic principles and one of the core contents of comprehensive treatment measures.SummaryThe current COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented. The prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of malnutrition should therefore be routinely included in the management of individuals with COVID-19.																					WOS:000651291800001	33125628

Age-related impairments in innate immunity and suboptimal virus-specific T cell and antibody responses are believed to cause severe disease upon respiratory virus infections. This phenomenon has recently received increased attention, as elderly patients are at substantially elevated risk for severe COVID-19 disease and experience increased rates of mortality following SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with younger populations. However, the basis for age-related fatal pneumonia following pathogenic hCoVs is not well understood. In this Review, we provide an overview of our current understanding of hCoV-induced fatal pneumonia in the elderly. We describe host immune response to hCoV infections derived from studies of young and aged animal models and discuss the potential role of age-associated increases in sterile inflammation (inflammaging) and virus-induced dysregulated inflammation in causing age-related severe disease. We also highlight the existing gaps in our knowledge about virus replication and host immune responses to hCoV infection in young and aged individuals.

Genomic analysis has revealed that bat and pangolin coronaviruses are phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2. The actual origin and passage history of the virus are unknown, but human-human transmission of the virus has been confirmed. Several diagnostic techniques have been developed to detect COVID-19 in this prevailing pandemic period. In this review, we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. The origin, structure, current diagnostic techniques, such as molecular assays based on oligonucleotides, immunoassay-based detection, nanomaterial-based biosensing, and distinctive sample based detection are also discussed. Furthermore, our review high-lights the admissible treatment strategies for COVID-19 and future perspectives on the development of biosensing techniques and vaccines for the diagnosis and prevention of the disease, respectively.

The cases were evaluated by an interdisciplinary team of health personnel from a fourth-level clinic in Barranquilla, Colombia, and the data was subsequently taken from the clinical history of each patient. Three cases were evaluated, initially the first case with torpid evolution, coinfection with H1N1 influenza virus, however, with satisfactory outcome, and cases two and three with gastrointestinal manifestations as disease debut, with satisfactory evolution. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic takes more lives every day, so it is necessary to describe the cases and their diverse variety of presentation, to identify the infected and take both therapeutic and preventive measures. To prevent the spread of the disease and achieve its control.	Resumen El objetivo del presente trabajo fue presentar una serie de casos de COVID-19 con manifestaciones atípicas de la enfermedad.

The Coronaviridae family's strains infect different animals and are popularly associated with several outbreaks, namely SARS and MERS epidemic. COVID-19 is one such recent outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 identified first in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on 11th March 2020. Our review provides information covering various facets of the disease starting from its origin, transmission, mutations in the virus to pathophysiological changes in the host upon infection followed by diagnostics and possible therapeutics available to tackle the situation. We have highlighted the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2, known to share 96.2% nucleotide similarity with bat coronavirus. Notably, several mutations in SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nucleocapsid protein, PLpro, and ORF3a are reported across the globe. These mutations could alter the usual receptor binding function, fusion process with the host cell, virus replication, and the virus's assembly. Therefore, studying these mutations could help understand the virus's virulence properties and design suitable therapeutics. Moreover, the aggravated immune response to COVID-19 can be fatal. Hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases are comorbidities substantially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The review article discusses these aspects, stating the importance of various comorbidities in disease outcomes. Furthermore, medications' unavailability compels the clinicians to opt for atypical drugs like remdesivir, chloroquine, etc. The current diagnostics of COVID-19 include qRT-PCR, CT scan, serological tests, etc. We have described these aspects to expose the information to the scientific community and to accelerate the research.

Though some developments were seen such as serial adaptation in various animal species or the creation of genetically engineered models, a suitable animal model remains elusive. A model that could display the severity of human illness and can be used for the fast-track evaluation of potential drugs as well as for the clinical trials of vaccines is an urgent need of the hour. In the light of huge information generated on SARS-CoV-2 and daily updates received from the research community, we have chosen to review the current status of animal models of SARS-CoV-2 in encompassing the areas of viral replication, transmission, active/passive immunization, clinical disease, and pathology. The review is intended to help the researchers in the selection of appropriate animal models for SARS CoV-2 research in the fight against the current global pandemic.

Cotton Rat Placenta Anatomy and Fc Receptor Expression and Their Roles in Maternal Antibody Transfer								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				70	6			510	519		10.30802/AALAS-CM-20-000040				DEC 2020	2020	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide. Currently no vaccine is available to prevent RSV infection, but virus-neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can be given prophylactically, emphasizing the protective potential of antibodies. One concept of RSV vaccinology is mothers' immunization to induce high antibody titers, leading to passive transfer of high levels of maternal antibody to the fetus through the placenta and to the neonate through colostrum. Cotton rats are an excellent small animal model for RSV infection and have been used to test maternal immunization. To mechanistically understand antibody transfer in the cotton rat model, we characterized the cotton rat placenta and Fc receptor localization. Placentas from cotton rats at midgestation (approximately day 14) and at late gestation (approximately day 25) and neonatal (younger than 1 wk) gastrointestinal tracts were collected for light microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. The cotton rat placenta is hemotrichorial and has 5 distinct layers: decidua, junctional zone, labyrinth, chorionic plate, and yolk sac. Consistent with the transfer of maternal antibodies, the majority of the Fc receptors are present in the yolk sac endoderm and fetal capillary endothelium of the chorionic plate, involving 10% of the cells within the labyrinth. In addition, Fc receptors are present on duodenal and jejunal enterocytes in cotton rats, similar to humans, mice, and rats. These findings provide the structural basis for the preand postnatal transfer of maternal antibodies described in cotton rats.																					WOS:000599815400005	33121562

In some instances, select mammals may be more likely to visit riparian areas (both close and distant to farms) as well as poultry farms, as compared to traditional reservoir hosts, such as waterfowl. Of significance, many mammalian species can successfully replicate and shed multiple avian IAVs to high titers without prior virus adaptation and often can shed virus in greater quantities than synanthropic avian species. Within this review, we summarize and discuss the potential risks that synanthropic mammals could pose by trafficking IAVs to poultry operations based on current and historic literature.

Molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathway and in silico approaches for vaccine design against COVID-19								JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY				110						101874	10.1016/j.jchemneu.2020.101874				DEC 2020	2020	COVID-19 has forsaken the world because of extremely high infection rates and high mortality rates. At present we have neither medicine nor vaccine to prevent this pandemic. Lockdowns, curfews, isolations, quarantines, and social distancing are the only ways to mitigate their infection. This is badly affecting the mental health of people. Hence, there is an urgent need to address this issue. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a novel Betacorona virus named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) which has emerged in the city of Wuhan in China and declared a pandemic by WHO since it affected almost all the countries the world, infected 24,182,030 people and caused 825,798 death as per data are compiled from John Hopkins University (JHU). The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has a single-stranded positive (+) sense RNA of-30 kb nucleotides. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence similarity (-79 %) with SARS-CoV. Envelope and nucleocapsids are two evolutionary conserved regions of SARS-CoV-2 having a sequence identity of about 96 % and 89.6 %, respectively as compared to SARS-CoV. The characterization of SARS-CoV-2 is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing. Transmission of this virus in the human occurs through the respiratory tract and decreases the respiration efficiency of lungs. Humans are generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 with an incubation period of 2-14 days. The virus first infects the lower airway and bind with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of alveolar epithelial cells. Due to the unavailability of drugs or vaccines, it is very urgent to design potential vaccines or drugs for COVID-19. Reverse vaccinology and immunoinformatic play an important role in designing potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. The suitable vaccine selects for SARS-CoV-2 based on binding energy between the target protein and the designed vaccine. The stability and activity of the designed vaccine can be estimated by using molecular docking and dynamic simulation approaches. This review mainly focused on the brief up to date information about COVID-19, molecular characterization, pathogen-host interaction pathways involved during COVID-19 infection. It also covers potential vaccine design against COVID-19 by using various computational approaches. SARS-CoV-2 enters brain tissue through the different pathway and harm human's brain and causes severe neurological disruption.																					WOS:000598502600003	33091590

It is now accepted that the wild fauna, probably bats, constitute the initial reservoir of the virus, but little is known about the role pets can play in the spread of the disease in human communities, knowing the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect some domestic animals. In this cross-sectional study, we tested the antibody response in a cluster of 21 domestic pets (9 cats and 12 dogs) living in close contact with their owners (belonging to a veterinary community of 20 students) in which two students tested positive for COVID-19 and several others (n = 11/18) consecutively showed clinical signs (fever, cough, anosmia, etc.) compatible with COVID-19 infection. Although a few pets presented many clinical signs indicative for a coronavirus infection, no antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detectable in their blood one month after the index case was reported, using an immunoprecipitation assay. These original data can serve a better evaluation of the host range of SARS-CoV-2 in natural environment exposure conditions.																					WOS:000581089100032	32904469

In this study, we investigated the seroepidemiology of protein antigens to Severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle eastern respiratory syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) in Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) in Adelaide, Australia sampled between September 2015 and February 2018. A total of 301 serum samples were collected and evaluated using a multiplex Luminex binding assay, and median fluorescence intensity thresholds were determined using finite-mixture modelling. We found evidence of antibodies reactive to SARS-CoV-1 or a related antigen with 42.5% (CI: 34.3%-51.2%) seroprevalence but insufficient evidence of reactivity to MERS-CoV antigen. This study provides evidence that the Grey-headed flying foxes sampled in Adelaide have been exposed to a SARS-like coronavirus.																					WOS:000592403700001	33142031

This study conducted surveillance for viruses in small mammals and assessed potential risks for virus transmission to people in urban settlements along rivers in Kathmandu, Nepal. We collected samples from 411 small mammals (100 rodents and 311 shrews) at four riverside settlement sites and detected six viruses from four virus families including Thottapalayam virus; a strain of murine coronavirus; two new paramyxoviruses; and two new rhabdoviruses. Additionally, we conducted surveys of 264 residents to characterize animal-human contact. Forty-eight percent of individuals reported contact with wildlife, primarily with rodents and shrews (91%). Our findings confirm that rodents and shrews should be considered a health threat for residents of temporary settlements, and that assessment of disease transmission risk coupled with targeted surveillance for emerging pathogens could lead to improved disease control and health security for urban populations. Additionally, interventions focused on disease prevention should consider the unique urban ecology and social dynamics in temporary settlements, along with the importance of community engagement for identifying solutions that address specific multi-dimensional challenges that life on the urban river margins presents.

It changed in the last two decades as three global outbreaks by coronaviruses led to significant mortality and morbidity. SARS CoV-1 led to the first epidemic of the twenty first century due to coronavirus. SARS COV-1 infection had a broad array of symptoms with respiratory and gastrointestinal as most frequent. The last known case was reported in 2004. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) led to the second outbreak in 2012, and case fatality was much higher than SARS. MERS-CoV has a wide array of clinical presentations from mild, moderate to severe, and some patients end up with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The third and recent outbreak by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December 2019, which lead to a global pandemic. Patients with SARS-CoV2 infection can be asymptomatic or have a range of symptoms with fever, cough, and shortness of breath being most common. Reverse transcriptase-Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a diagnostic test of choice for SARS CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV-2 infections. This review aims to discuss epidemiological, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of human coronaviruses with a focus on SARS CoV-1, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV-2.

Pathogens such as viruses are always evolving owing to the processes of antigenic shift and drift. Such viral evolution results in the emergence of new types and serovars that prove deadly for humans-like influenza pandemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). The pandemic of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the recent example. It has resulted in a great loss of human lives and a serious burden on economy across the globe. To counter such situations, a system should exist for the early detection of emerging viral pathogens. This will help prevent possible outbreaks and save human lives. Most of such deadly novel viruses and viral outbreaks are known to be originated from animal hosts. Regular monitoring of potential hot spots of such emerging microbes, such as zoos and animal markets, through metagenomics could help assess the presence of new viruses and pathogens. In this review, we focus on the potential of viral metagenomics and propose a surveillance system based on it for the early detection and hence prevention of such emerging viral infections.

J	Horie, Masayuki; Akashi, Hiroshi; Kawata, Masakado; Tomonaga, Keizo								Identification of a reptile lyssavirus in Anolis allogus provided novel insights into lyssavirus evolution								VIRUS GENES				57	1			40	49		10.1007/s11262-020-01803-y		NOV 2020		FEB 2021	2021	Lyssaviruses (genus Lyssavirus) are negative-strand RNA viruses belonging to the family Rhabdoviridae. Although a lyssa-like virus (frog lyssa-like virus 1 [FLLV-1]), which is distantly related to lyssaviruses, was recently identified in frogs, a large phylogenetic gap exists between those viruses, and thus the evolution of lyssaviruses is unclear. In this study, we detected a lyssa-like virus from publicly available RNA-seq data obtained using the brain and skin of Anolis allogus (Spanish flag anole), which was designated anole lyssa-like virus 1 (ALLV-1), and determined its complete coding sequence. Via mapping analysis, we demonstrated that ALLV-1 was actively replicating in the original brain and skin samples. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that ALLV-1 is more closely related to lyssaviruses than FLLV-1. Overall, the topology of the tree is compatible with that of hosts, suggesting the long-term co-divergence of lyssa-like and lyssaviruses and vertebrates. The psi region, which is a long 3 ' untranslated region of unknown origin present in the G mRNA of lyssaviruses (approximately 400-700 nucleotides), is also present in the genome of ALLV-1, but it is much shorter (approximately 180 nucleotides) than those of lyssaviruses. Interestingly, FLLV-1 lacks the psi region, suggesting that the psi region was acquired after the divergence of the FLLV-1 and ALLV-1/lyssavirus lineages. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to identify a lyssa-like virus in reptiles, and thus, our findings provide novel insights into the evolution of lyssaviruses.

Here, we show how to go beyond historical reconstructions and use spatially-explicit phylogeographic and phylodynamic approaches to formally test epidemiological hypotheses. We illustrate our approach by focusing on the West Nile virus (WNV) spread in North America that has substantially impacted public, veterinary, and wildlife health. We apply an analytical workflow to a comprehensive WNV genome collection to test the impact of environmental factors on the dispersal of viral lineages and on viral population genetic diversity through time. We find that WNV lineages tend to disperse faster in areas with higher temperatures and we identify temporal variation in temperature as a main predictor of viral genetic diversity through time. By contrasting inference with simulation, we find no evidence for viral lineages to preferentially circulate within the same migratory bird flyway, suggesting a substantial role for non-migratory birds or mosquito dispersal along the longitudinal gradient. Classical epidemiological approaches have been limited in their ability to formally test hypotheses. Here, Dellicour et al. illustrate how phylodynamic and phylogeographic analyses can be leveraged for hypothesis testing in molecular epidemiology using West Nile virus in North America as an example.

They cause significant morbidity and mortality every year in all age groups and regions of the world. Their etiology is diverse, and seasonal viruses began their journey, at some point, with an episode of expansion before their annual circulation as seasonal agents. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is a challenge for Latin America. Understanding dynamics is essential for decision making, to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. Recent Findings Currently, governments in Latin America have taken measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 primarily based on World Health Organization recommendations. However, the potential impact of the virus in Latin America is still unknown. Given the urgency, governments need more accurate estimates of what could happen in Latin America in order to make informed decisions, At the September 20, 2020, cumulative cases 2295 of COVID-19 per 1 million population has been registered in Latin America and the Caribbean. Brazil, Peru, and Chile are the most countries affected by this pandemic, registering a total of cumulative cases per million inhabitants of 21,148, 22,941, and 23,262 respectively. Peru has shown the highest death numbers with 949 per million inhabitants. The Latin American health authorities should make the most beneficial decisions based in scientific facts for the health and life of citizens, both understood in the broadest and most inclusive sense. Once the epidemic is over, Latin America should begin a profound health reform, at a single and universal health system, integrated and coordinated, where the leading role of the Ministry of Health is resumed, to have a national network of modern, integrated, and excellent quality laboratories for the benefit of the entire society.

J	Alakunle, Emmanuel; Moens, Ugo; Nchinda, Godwin; Okeke, Malachy Ifeanyi								Monkeypox Virus in Nigeria: Infection Biology, Epidemiology, and Evolution								VIRUSES-BASEL				12	11					1257	10.3390/v12111257				NOV 2020	2020	Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease caused by monkeypox virus (MPXV), which is a member of orthopoxvirus genus. The reemergence of MPXV in 2017 (at Bayelsa state) after 39 years of no reported case in Nigeria, and the export of travelers' monkeypox (MPX) from Nigeria to other parts of the world, in 2018 and 2019, respectively, have raised concern that MPXV may have emerged to occupy the ecological and immunological niche vacated by smallpox virus. This review X-rays the current state of knowledge pertaining the infection biology, epidemiology, and evolution of MPXV in Nigeria and worldwide, especially with regard to the human, cellular, and viral factors that modulate the virus transmission dynamics, infection, and its maintenance in nature. This paper also elucidates the role of recombination, gene loss and gene gain in MPXV evolution, chronicles the role of signaling in MPXV infection, and reviews the current therapeutic options available for the treatment and prevention of MPX. Additionally, genome-wide phylogenetic analysis was undertaken, and we show that MPXV isolates from recent 2017 outbreak in Nigeria were monophyletic with the isolate exported to Israel from Nigeria but do not share the most recent common ancestor with isolates obtained from earlier outbreaks, in 1971 and 1978, respectively. Finally, the review highlighted gaps in knowledge particularly the non-identification of a definitive reservoir host animal for MPXV and proposed future research endeavors to address the unresolved questions.

Serologic Evidence of Arthropod-Borne Virus Infections in Wild and Captive Ruminants in Ontario, Canada								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				103	5			2100	2107		10.4269/ajtmh.20-0539				NOV 2020	2020	Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are globally widespread, and their transmission cycles typically involve numerous vertebrate species. Serologic testing of animal hosts can provide a routine surveillance approach to monitoring animal disease systems, can provide a surveillance alternative to arthropod testing and human case reports, and may augment knowledge of epizootiology. Wild and captive ruminants represent good candidate sentinels to track geographic distribution and prevalence of select arboviruses. They often are geographically widespread and abundant, inhabit areas shared by humans and domestic animals, and are readily fed on by various hematophagous arthropod vectors. Ontario, Canada, is home to high densities of coexisting humans, livestock, and wild cervids, as well as growing numbers of arthropod vectors because of the effects of climate change. We collected blood samples from 349 livestock (cattle/sheep) and 217 cervids (wild/farmed/zoo) in Ontario (2016-2019) to assess for antibodies to zoonotic and agriculturally important arboviruses. Livestock sera were tested for antibodies to bluetongue virus (BTV) and epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). Sera from cervids were tested for antibodies to BTV, EHDV, West Nile virus (WNV), eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV), Powassan virus (POWV), and heartland virus (HRTV). Fifteen (9.0%) cattle were seropositive for EHDV-serotype 2. Nine (4.2%) cervids were seropositive for arboviruses; three confirmed as WNV, three as EEEV, and one as POWV. All animals were seronegative for BTV and HRTV. These results reveal low seroprevalence of important agricultural, wildlife, and zoonotic pathogens and underline the need for continued surveillance in this and other regions in the face of changing environmental conditions.

It is a real test for all health authorities including Arab countries. In this review, we aimed to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 in the Arab world. In addition, to compare the findings of this study with other top affected countries.Methodology: We searched for official websites from the Ministries of Health and other official sources in all 22 Arab countries. Medline, Science Direct and Google Scholar websites were also used to search for COVID-19, 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus. The time period was from 1 January 2020 to 31 May 2020.Results: As of May 31, 2020, COVID-19 has caused 290,428 confirmed cases, 3,696 deaths and 157,886 cured cases in all Arab countries. In terms of confirmed cases, Saudi Arabia followed by Qatar, UAE, Kuwait and Egypt have the highest reported cases. However, the total number of deaths was dominant in Egypt, followed by Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and UAE. In comparison to other non-Arab countries and confirmed cases, Arab countries come fourth after USA, Brazil and Russia. In terms of death, the Arab world is not listed as the top ten affected countries as only scored eight deaths per million have been recorded.Conclusions: Most Arab countries took some serious early steps to minimize the outbreak of COVID-19. At the moment, controlling the source of infection, the route of transmission and taking care of infected patients are the main challenges for health authorities in all Arab countries.

Of the 52 animals belonging to the farm, 5 (9.6%) died with severe respiratory distress, death occurring 3-4 days after the appearance of the respiratory signs (caught and gasping breath). Microbiological analysis revealed absence of pathogenic bacteria whilst Real-time PCR identified the presence of RNA from Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) in several organs: lungs, small intestine (jejunum), mediastinal lymph nodes, liver and placenta. BCoV was therefore hypothesized to play a role in the lethal pulmonary infection. Like the other CoVs, BCoV is able to cause different syndromes. Its role in calf diarrhea and in mild respiratory disease is well known: we report instead the involvement of this virus in a severe and fatal respiratory disorder, with symptoms and disease evolution resembling those of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS).

Flaviviridae members, including hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses, extensively manipulate host lipid metabolism, underlining the importance of lipid droplets (LDs) in viral infection. LDs are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles that can act as sequestration platforms for a unique subset of host and viral proteins. Transient recruitment and mobilization of proteins to LDs during viral infection impacts host-cell biological properties, LD functionality and canonical protein functions. Notably, recent studies identified LDs in the nucleus and also identified that LDs are transported extracellularly via an autophagy-mediated mechanism, indicating a novel role for autophagy in Flaviviridae infections. These developments underline an unsuspected diversity and localization of LDs and potential moonlighting functions of LD-associated proteins during infection. This review summarizes recent breakthroughs concerning the LD hijacking activities of hepatitis C, dengue and Zika viruses and potential roles of cytoplasmic, nuclear and extracellular LD-associated viral proteins during infection.

Drawing Comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and the Animal Coronaviruses								MICROORGANISMS				8	11					1840	10.3390/microorganisms8111840				NOV 2020	2020	The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by a novel zoonotic coronavirus (CoV), SARS-CoV-2, has infected 46,182 million people, resulting in 1,197,026 deaths (as of 1 November 2020), with devastating and far-reaching impacts on economies and societies worldwide. The complex origin, extended human-to-human transmission, pathogenesis, host immune responses, and various clinical presentations of SARS-CoV-2 have presented serious challenges in understanding and combating the pandemic situation. Human CoVs gained attention only after the SARS-CoV outbreak of 2002-2003. On the other hand, animal CoVs have been studied extensively for many decades, providing a plethora of important information on their genetic diversity, transmission, tissue tropism and pathology, host immunity, and therapeutic and prophylactic strategies, some of which have striking resemblance to those seen with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the evolution of human CoVs, including SARS-CoV-2, is intermingled with those of animal CoVs. In this comprehensive review, attempts have been made to compare the current knowledge on evolution, transmission, pathogenesis, immunopathology, therapeutics, and prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 with those of various animal CoVs. Information on animal CoVs might enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2, and accordingly, benefit the development of effective control and prevention strategies against COVID-19.

Since the inception of this disease, the mystery about the origin still persists. Over 3200 types of CoVs can infect bats; therefore, finding out the susceptibility of CoVs to specific species of bats is always challenging. Similarities of pangolin-CoV with SARS-CoV-2 and bat CoV suggested pangolin as another intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. Recombination mechanism is primarily crucial to understand the origin of CoVs as it creates genetic diversity, thus novel variants of viruses emerged. In this review, attention has been paid to understand the origin and structure of SARS-CoV-2. This will help prevent similar pandemics in the future as well as effective in discovering possible therapeutic targets and vaccines.																					WOS:000595793200003

Surveillance for early detection of RVF virus circulation implies very low design prevalence values and thus sampling a high number of animals, so feasibility issues may rise. Passive surveillance based on notified abortions in ruminants is key for early warning and at present the only feasible surveillance option. The assessment of vaccination and culling against RVF in Mayotte suggests that vaccination is more effective when quickly implemented throughout the population, e.g. at a rate of 200 or 2,000 animals vaccinated per day. Test and cull is not an option for RVF control in Mayotte given the high number of animals that would need to be tested. If the risk of RVFV introduction into the continental EU increases, ruminant establishments close to possible points of disease incursion should be included in the surveillance. An enhanced surveillance on reproductive disorders should be applied during summer in risk areas. Serosurveillance targets of 0.3% animals should be at least considered. RVF control measures possibly applied in the continental EU have been assessed in the Netherlands, as an example. Culling animals on farms within a 20 km radius of detected farms appears as the most effective measure to control RVF spread, although too many animals should be culled. Alternative measures are vaccination in a 50 km radius around detection, ring vaccination between 20 and 50 km and culling of detected farms. The assessment of zoning showed that, following RVFV introduction and considering an R-0 = 2, a mean vector dispersal of 10 km and 10 farms initially detected, RVFV would spread beyond a radius of up to 100 km or 50 km from the infected area with 10% or 55% probability, respectively.

Competency of Amphibians and Reptiles and Their Potential Role as Reservoir Hosts for Rift Valley Fever Virus								VIRUSES-BASEL				12	11					1206	10.3390/v12111206				NOV 2020	2020	Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne zoonotic pathogen, which is endemic in Africa, causing large epidemics, characterized by severe diseases in ruminants but also in humans. As in vitro and field investigations proposed amphibians and reptiles to potentially play a role in the enzootic amplification of the virus, we experimentally infected African common toads and common agamas with two RVFV strains. Lymph or sera, as well as oral, cutaneous and anal swabs were collected from the challenged animals to investigate seroconversion, viremia and virus shedding. Furthermore, groups of animals were euthanized 3, 10 and 21 days post-infection (dpi) to examine viral loads in different tissues during the infection. Our data show for the first time that toads are refractory to RVFV infection, showing neither seroconversion, viremia, shedding nor tissue manifestation. In contrast, all agamas challenged with the RVFV strain ZH501 carried virus genomes in the spleens at 3 dpi, but the animals displayed neither viremia nor virus shedding. In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that amphibians are not susceptible and reptiles are only susceptible to a low extent to RVFV, indicating that both species play, if at all, rather a subordinate role in the RVF virus ecology.

In order to cast fresh light on the spread of the virus and on the effectiveness of the containment measures adopted globally, we used 26,869 SARS-CoV-2 genomes to build a phylogeny with 20,247 mutation events and adopted a phylogeographic approach. We confirmed that the phylogeny pinpoints China as the origin of the pandemic with major founders worldwide, mainly during January 2020. However, a single specific East Asian founder underwent massive radiation in Europe and became the main actor of the subsequent spread worldwide during March 2020. This lineage accounts for the great majority of cases detected globally and even spread back to the source in East Asia. Despite an East Asian source, therefore, the global pandemic was mainly fueled by its expansion across and out of Europe. It seems likely that travel bans established throughout the world in the second half of March helped to decrease the number of intercontinental exchanges, particularly from mainland China, but were less effective between Europe and North America where exchanges in both directions are visible up to April, long after bans were imposed.

The transmission mechanisms of members of the coronavirus family, the SARS-CoV of 2003 and the MERS-CoV of 2012, were widely studied due to the severity of the epidemic outbreaks caused by their contagion efficiency and by the mortality rate respectively. The spread of the COVID-19 occurs mainly by airborne transmission via inhalation of aerosols and drops, and by direct contact with contaminated objects and surfaces which contain particles of the virus. However, other probable transmission mechanisms will be analyzed in the present article. These mechanisms require further study to ensure whether they are relevant mechanisms to be considered in the epidemiological chain of SARS-CoV-2. Among these routes of transmission are considered the fecal-oral transmission, fluid transmission, and vertical or maternal-fetal. On the other hand, environmental factors could have an effect over the risk of contagion under certain conditions. However, the data regarding the interaction of the virus in the environment belong to isolated samples that still do not allow to draw conclusions on this matter.	La enfermedad del coronavirus del 2019 se produce por la transmisión del SARS-CoV-2, virus perteneciente a la familia de los coronavirus. Los mecanismos de transmisión de miembros de esta familia, el SARS-CoV del 2003 y el MERS-CoV del 2012, fueron ampliamente estudiados debido a la gravedad de los brotes epidémicos que causaron por su eficiencia de contagio y por la tasa de mortalidad respectivamente. El contagio de la enfermedad del COVID-19 sucede principalmente por transmisión respiratoria por medio de la inhalación de gotas y aerosoles y por medio de contacto directo con objetos y superficies contaminadas por partículas que contienen al virus. Sin embargo, en el presente artículo también se analizarán otros probables mecanismos de transmisión que requieren de mayor estudio para asegurar si constituyen mecanismos relevantes a considerarse en la cadena epidemiológica del SARS-CoV-2. Entre estas vías de transmisión se consideran la transmisión fecal-oral, la transmisión por medio de fluidos y la transmisión vertical o maternofetal. Por otra parte, los factores ambientales podrían tener incidencia sobre el riesgo de contagio bajo ciertas condiciones. Sin embargo, se cuenta con datos aislados respecto a la interacción del virus en el medio ambiente que aún no permiten obtener conclusiones respecto a este tema.

The combination of numerical encoding techniques and digital signal processing methods are becoming increasingly important in handling large genomic data. In this paper, we propose to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 genomic signature using the combination of different nucleotide representations and signal processing tools in the aim to identify its genetic origin. The sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was compared with 21 relevant sequences including Bat, Yak and Pangolin coronavirus sequences. In addition, we developed a new algorithm to locate the nucleotide modifications. The results show that the Bat and Pangolin coronaviruses were the most related to SARS-CoV-2 with 96% and 86% of identity all along the genome. Within the S gene sequence, the Pangolin sequence presents local highest nucleotide identity. Those findings suggest genesis of SARS-Cov-2 through evolution from Bat and Pangolin strains. This study offers new ways to automatically characterize viruses.																					WOS:000600715100003	32645523

There are many reports on COVID-19 associated with the amplified incidence of thrombotic events. In this review, we focused on COVID-19 coupled with the coagulopathy contributes to severe outcome inclusive of comorbidities such as venous thromboembolism, stroke, diabetes, lung, heart attack, AKI, and liver injury. Initially, the COVID-19 patient associated coagulation disorders show an elevated level of the D-dimer, fibrinogen, and less lymphocyte count such as lymphopenia. COVID-19 associated with the Kawasaki disease has acute vasculitis in childhood which further affects the vessels found all over the body. COVID-19 linked with the thrombotic microangiopathy triggers the multiple vasculitis along with the arterioles thrombosis, medium, large venous and arterial vessels mediates the disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). SARS-CoV-2 patients have reduced primary platelet production, increased destruction of the platelet, decreased circulating platelet leads to the condition of increased thrombocytopenia which contributes to the coagulation disorder. Endothelial dysfunction plays an important role in the coagulation disorders via increased generation of the thrombin and stops fibrinolysis further leads to hypercoagulopathy. Along with that endothelial dysfunction activates the complement system pathways and contributes to the acute and chronic inflammation via cytokine storm with the production of the cytokines and chemokines, coagulation in different organs such as lung, brain, liver, heart, kidney and further leads to multi-organ failure.

It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which emerged at the end of 2019 in Wuhan, China, quickly spreading worldwide. COVID-19 is a disease with symptoms that range from fever and breathing difficulty to acute respiratory distress and death, critically affecting older patients and people with previous comorbidities. SARS-CoV-2 uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract, which it then uses to reach several organs. The immune system of infected patients has been demonstrated to suffer important alterations, such as lymphopenia, exhausted lymphocytes, excessive amounts of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages, especially in the lungs, and cytokine storms, which may contribute to its severity and difficulty of establishing an effective treatment. Even though no specific treatment is currently available, several studies have been investigating potential therapeutic strategies, including the use of previously approved drugs and immunotherapy. In this context, this review addresses the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 and the patient's host immune system during infection, in addition to discussing the main immunopathological mechanisms involved in the development of the disease and potential new therapeutic approaches.

J	Paltrinieri, Saverio; Giordano, Alessia; Stranieri, Angelica; Lauzi, Stefania								Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19): Are they similar?								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				68	4			1786	1799		10.1111/tbed.13856		OCT 2020		JUL 2021	2021	SARS-CoV-2 has radically changed our lives causing hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide and influencing our lifestyle and habits. Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a disease of felids caused by the feline coronaviruses (FCoV). FIP has been considered irremediably deadly until the last few years. Being one of the numerous coronaviruses that are well known in veterinary medicine, information on FCoV could be of interest and might give suggestions on pathogenic aspects of SARS-CoV-2 that are still unclear. The authors of this paper describe the most important aspects of FIP and COVID-19 and the similarities and differences between these important diseases. SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV are taxonomically distant viruses, and recombination events with other coronaviruses have been reported for FCoV and have been suggested for SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and FCoV differ in terms of some pathogenic, clinical and pathological features. However, some of the pathogenic and immunopathogenic events that are well known in cats FIP seem to be present also in people with COVID-19. Moreover, preventive measures currently recommended to prevent SARS-CoV-2 spreading have been shown to allow eradication of FIP in feline households. Finally, one of the most promising therapeutic compounds against FIP, GS-441524, is the active form of Remdesivir, which is being used as one therapeutic option for COVID-19.

It is a non-pathogenic virus and is transmitted among humans mainly through the exposure to contaminated blood and is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, among other viruses. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of HPgV viremia, its association with HIV and clinical epidemiological factors, as well as the full-length sequencing and genome characterization of HPgV recovered from blood donors of the HEMOPA Foundation in Belem-PA-Brazil.Methods Plasma samples were obtained from 459 donors, tested for the presence of HPgV RNA by the RT-qPCR. From these, a total of 26 RT-qPCR positive samples were submitted to the NGS sequencing approach in order to obtain the full genome. Genome characterization and phylogenetic analysis were conducted.Results The prevalence of HPgV was 12.42%. We observed the highest prevalences among donors aged between 18 and 30 years old (16.5%), with brown skin color (13.2%) and men (15.8%). The newly diagnosed HIV-1 prevalence was 26.67%. The HPgV genotype 2 (2a and 2b) was identified. No data on viral load value was found to corroborate the protective effect of HPgV on HIV evolution.Conclusions This study provided information regarding the HPgV infection among blood donors from HEMOPA Foundation. Furthermore, we genetically characterized the HPgV circulating strains and described by the first time nearly complete genomes of genotype 2 in Brazilian Amazon.

This ongoing pandemic has now been reported in 215 countries with more than 23 million confirmed cases and more than 803 thousand deaths worldwide as of August 22, 2020. Although efforts are undergoing, there is no approved vaccine or any specific antiretroviral drug to treat COVID-19 so far. It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 can affect not only humans but also pets and other domestic and wild animals, making it a one health global problem. Several published scientific evidence has shown that bats are the initial reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2, and pangolins are suggested as an intermediate hosts. So far, little is known concerning the role of pets and other animals in the transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, updated knowledge about the potential role of pets in the current outbreak will be of paramount importance for effective prevention and control of the disease. This review summarized the current evidence about the role of pets and other animals in the transmission of COVID-19.																					WOS:000576955900001	33008410

Harnessing nitric oxide for preventing, limiting and treating the severe pulmonary consequences of COVID-19								NITRIC OXIDE-BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY				103				4	8		10.1016/j.niox.2020.07.003				OCT 1 2020	2020	The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 has quickly become a daunting challenge to global health. In the absence of targeted therapy and a reported 5.5% case fatality rate in the United States, treatments preventing rapid cardiopulmonary failure are urgently needed. Clinical features, pathology and homology to better understood pathogens suggest that uncontrolled inflammation and a cytokine storm likely drive COVID-19's unrelenting disease process. Interventions that are protective against acute lung injury and ARDS can play a critical role for patients and health systems during this pandemic. Nitric oxide is an antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory molecule with key roles in pulmonary vascular function in the context of viral infections and other pulmonary disease states. This article reviews the rationale for exogenous nitric oxide use for the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and highlights its potential for contributing to better clinical outcomes and alleviating the rapidly rising strain on healthcare capacity.

These are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses sharing a similar genome organization and replication scheme with certain unique features that differentiate them. All viruses in this family express a single polyprotein that encodes structural and nonstructural proteins at the N- and C-terminal regions, respectively. In general, the host signal peptidase cleaves the structural protein junction sites, while virus-encoded proteases process the nonstructural polyprotein region. It is known that signal peptidase processing is a rapid, co-translational event. Interestingly, certain signal peptidase processing site(s) in different Flaviviridae viral structural protein precursors display suboptimal cleavage kinetics. This review focuses on the recent progress regarding the Flaviviridae virus genus-specific mechanisms to downregulate signal peptidase-mediated processing at particular viral polyprotein junction sites and the role of delayed processing at these sites in infectious virus particle assembly.

J	Gao, You-Wen; Wan, Zheng-Wei; Wu, Yue; Li, Xiu-Fen; Tang, Shing-Xing								PCR-based screening and phylogenetic analysis of rat pegivirus (RPgV) carried by rodents in China								JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL SCIENCE				82	10			1464	1471		10.1292/jvms.19-0530				OCT 2020	2020	Rodent-borne pegiviruses were initially identified in serum samples from desert wood-rats in 2013, and subsequently in serum samples from commensal rats in 2014. However, the prevalence and phylogenetic characteristics of rodent pegiviruses in China are poorly understood. In this study, we screened serum samples collected from wild rats in southern China between 2015 and 2016 for the presence of rat pegivirus (RPgV) by PCR. Among the 314 serum samples from murine rodents (Rattus norvegicus, Rattus tanezumi, and Rattus losea) and house shrews (Suncus murinus), 21.66% (68/314) tested positive for RPgV. Out of these, 23.81% (62/219) of samples from R. norvegicus tested positive, which was significantly higher than that for the other species: 7.69% (1/13), 5.88% (2/34), and 6.25% (3/48) for R. tanezumi, R. losea, and S. murinus, respectively (X-2=18.91, P<0.001). Phylogenetic analysis revealed clustering of viral sequences in the main rodent clade. Analysis of the 3 near-full-length genome sequences of RPgV obtained in this study showed that these viruses exhibited mean nucleic acid and amino acid identities of 94.1% and 98.5% with Chinese RPgV strains, and 90.3 and 97.1% with an RPgV strain from the USA, respectively. This study provides novel insights into the geographic distribution of rodent pegiviruses in China, and identifies potential animal hosts for future studies of these pegiviruses.

Discovery of a Novel Simian Pegivirus in Common Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with Lymphocytic Enterocolitis								MICROORGANISMS				8	10					1509	10.3390/microorganisms8101509				OCT 2020	2020	From 2010 to 2015, 73 common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) housed at the Wisconsin National Primate Research Center (WNPRC) were diagnosed postmortem with lymphocytic enterocolitis. We used unbiased deep-sequencing to screen the blood of deceased enterocolitis-positive marmosets for viruses. In five out of eight common marmosets with lymphocytic enterocolitis, we discovered a novel pegivirus not present in ten matched, clinically normal controls. The novel virus, which we named Southwest bike trail virus (SOBV), is most closely related (68% nucleotide identity) to a strain of simian pegivirus A isolated from a three-striped night monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). We screened 146 living WNPRC common marmosets for SOBV, finding an overall prevalence of 34% (50/146). Over four years, 85 of these 146 animals died or were euthanized. Histological examination revealed 27 SOBV-positive marmosets from this cohort had lymphocytic enterocolitis, compared to 42 SOBV-negative marmosets, indicating no association between SOBV and disease in this cohort (p = 0.0798). We also detected SOBV in two of 33 (6%) clinically normal marmosets screened during transfer from the New England Primate Research Center, suggesting SOBV could be exerting confounding influences on comparisons of common marmoset studies from multiple colonies.

The highly contagious COVID-19 infection has affected millions of people to date and has led to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide. Aside from the highly infectious nature of SARS-CoV-2, the lack of a treatment or vaccine has been the main reason for its spread. Thus, it has become necessary to find alternative methods for controlling SARS-CoV-2. For the present review, we conducted an online search for different available nutrition-based therapies for previously known coronavirus infections and RNA-based virus infections as well as general antiviral therapies. These treatments have promise for combating COVID-19, as various nutrients and minerals play direct and indirect roles in the control and prevention of this newly emerged viral infection. The patients' nutritional status with COVID-19 must be analyzed before administering any treatment, and nutritional supplements should be given to the affected individuals along with routine treatment. We suggest a potential interventional role of nutrients to strengthen the immune system against the emerging infection caused by COVID-19.																					WOS:000586921600001	33003648

Animal models of congenital zika syndrome provide mechanistic insight into viral pathogenesis during pregnancy								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				14	10					e0008707	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008707				OCT 2020	2020	In utero Zika virus (ZIKV; familyFlaviviridae) infection causes a distinct pattern of birth defects and disabilities in the developing fetus and neonate that has been termed congenital zika syndrome (CZS). Over 8,000 children were affected by the 2016 to 2017 ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, many of whom developed CZS as a result of in utero exposure. To date, there is no consensus about how ZIKV causes CZS; animal models, however, are providing mechanistic insights. Using nonhuman primates, immunocompromised mice, immunocompetent mice, and other animal models (e.g., pigs, sheep, guinea pigs, and hamsters), studies are showing that maternal immunological responses, placental infection and inflammation, as well as viral genetic factors play significant roles in predicting the downstream consequences of in utero ZIKV infection on the development of CZS in offspring. There are thousands of children suffering from adverse consequences of CZS. Therefore, the animal models developed to study ZIKV-induced adverse outcomes in offspring could provide mechanistic insights into how other viruses, including influenza and hepatitis C viruses, impact placental viability and fetal growth to cause long-term adverse outcomes in an effort to identify therapeutic treatments.

From blood samples, serum was separated and tested for HGV by using ELISA Kit.Results: Out of 196 patients, 123 were males and 73 females. Mean age was 40 years. We found 47(23.9%) positive for Hepatitis-B infection, 65(33.2%) positive for Hepatitis-C infection, 28(14.3%) positive for Hepatitis-D infection, 37(18.9%) with cirrhosis of liver and 19(9.7%) with carcinoma of liver. Among them, 7(3.6%) were positive for HGV. HGV was co-related with Hepatitis-C (5 cases) and Hepatitis-D (2 cases) and there was no case found for HGV positive in patients with carcinoma of liver, cirrhosis of liver and Hepatitis-B. Male were more prone than female and common in married and in young ages. Those patients who are more prone to blood transfusion and blood products were at high risk of exposure such as thalassemia, hemophilia and persons with liver transplantation and I/V drug abusers and on hemodialysis.Conclusion: Prevalence of HGV was 3.6% in liver disease and more prone in male with younger ages.

Here, we report a new, genetically distinct pegivirus in goose (Anser cygnoides), the first identified in a nonmammalian host species. Goose pegivirus (GPgV) can be propagated in goslings, embryonated goose eggs, and primary goose embryo fibroblasts, and is thus the first pegivirus that can be efficiently cultured in vitro. Experimental infection of GPgV in goslings via intravenous injection revealed robust replication and high lymphotropism. Analysis of the tissue tropism of GPgV revealed that the spleen and thymus were the organs bearing the highest viral loads. Importantly, GPgV could promote clinical manifestations of goose parvovirus infection, including reduced weight gain and 7% mortality. This finding contrasts with the lack of pathogenicity that is characteristic of previously reported pegiviruses.IMPORTANCE Members of the Pegivirus genus, family Flaviviridae, widely infect humans and other mammals, but are described as causing persistent infection and lacking pathogenicity. The efficiency of in vitro replication systems for pegivirus is poor, thus limiting investigation into viral replication steps. Because of that, the pathogenesis, cellular tropism, route of transmission, biology, and epidemiology of pegiviruses remain largely uncovered. Here, we report a phylogenetically distinct goose pegivirus (GPgV) that should be classified as a new species. GPgV proliferated in cell culture in a speciesand cell-type-specific manner. Animal experiments show GPgV lymphotropism and promote goose parvovirus clinical manifestations. This study provides the first cell culture model for pegivirus, opening new possibilities for studies of pegivirus molecular biology. More importantly, our findings stand in contrast to the lack of identified pathogenicity of previously reported pegiviruses, which sheds lights on the pathobiology of pegivirus.

Rooted in the respective gs/GD lineage, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) has genetically diversified into a plethora of clades and subclades and evolved into an assortment of sub- and genotypes. Some caused substantial losses in the poultry industry and had a major impact on wild bird populations alongside public health implications due to a zoonotic potential of certain clades. After the primary introduction of the HPAI H5N1 gs/GD lineage into Europe in autumn 2005 and winter 2005/2006, Germany has seen recurring incursions of four varying H5Nx subtypes (H5N1, H5N8, H5N5, H5N6) carrying multiple distinct reassortants, all descendants of the gs/GD virus. The first HPAIV H5 epidemic in Germany during 2006/2007 was caused by a clade 2.2 subtype H5N1 virus. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed three distinct clusters belonging to clades 2.2.1, 2.2.2 and 2.2, concurring with geographic and temporal structures. From 2014 onwards, HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4 has dominated the epidemiological situation in Germany. The initial clade 2.3.4.4a HPAIV H5N8, reaching Germany in November 2014, caused a limited epidemic affecting five poultry holdings, one zoo in Northern Germany and few wild birds. After November 2016, HPAIV of clade 2.3.4.4b have dominated the situation to date. The most extensive HPAIV H5 epidemic on record reached Germany in winter 2016/2017, encompassing multiple incursion events with two subtypes (H5N8, H5N5) and entailing five reassortants. A novel H5N6 clade 2.3.4.4b strain affected Germany from December 2017 onwards, instigating low-level infection in smallholdings and wild birds. Recently, in spring 2020, a novel incursion of a genetically distinct HPAI clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 virus caused another epidemic in Europe, which affected a small number of poultry holdings, one zoo and two wild birds throughout Germany.

In this context, this study assesses the adequacy and potency of treatment for pneumonia associated with the Novel SARS-CoV-2. Counting from 27th February 2020, exponential rise in cases of SARS-CoV-2 has been recorded in Nigeria. Despite limited data on person-to-person transmission or nosocomial transmission, we report the epidemiological features of a familial cluster of 4 positive cases to SARS-CoV-2 in Nasarawa State, North Central Nigeria. This cluster presented with an unexplained pneumonia after having contact with a family member who died after manifesting symptoms of Novel SARS-CoV-2; the test came out positive after his demise. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS CoV-2 nucleic acid were performed using nasopharyngeal swabs (Novel Coronavirus PCR Fluorescence Diagnostic Kit, BioGerm Medical Biotechnology at the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Abuja. Nigeria. From March 10, 2020, we enrolled a family of four patients out of a family of 10 who were positive to novel coronavirus. Four family members (aged 36-43 years) all presented with fever, upper or lower respiratory act symptoms, or diarrhea, or a combination of these 3-6 days after exposure. These conditions continued to manifest at the Federal Medical Center, Keffi in Nasarawa State, 3-7 days after symptom onset. Their nasopharyngeal or throat swabs of these 10 family members were taken and four returned positive to coronavirus, while six tested negative. The epidemiological evidence from our study on familial cluster analysis reveals possible transmission of Novel SARS-CoV-2 during the incubation period. Study outcomes underscore the importance of probing contact history of potentially infected individuals, for prompt identification to preventing further spread.

The trimeric viral spike (S) protein catalyzes fusion between viral and target cell membranes to initiate infection. Here, we report two cryo-electron microscopy structures derived from a preparation of the full-length S protein, representing its prefusion (2.9-angstrom resolution) and postfusion (3.0-angstrom resolution) conformations, respectively. The spontaneous transition to the postfusion state is independent of target cells. The prefusion trimer has three receptor-binding domains clamped down by a segment adjacent to the fusion peptide. The postfusion structure is strategically decorated by N-linked glycans, suggesting possible protective roles against host immune responses and harsh external conditions. These findings advance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 entry and may guide the development of vaccines and therapeutics.																					WOS:000574653300027	32694201

The geographic distribution of animal CoVs is worldwide and prevalences were reported in several countries across the five continents. The viruses are known to cause mainly gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases with different severity levels. In certain cases, CoV infections are responsible of huge economic losses associated or not to highly public health impact. Despite being enveloped, CoVs are relatively resistant pathogens in the environment. Coronaviruses are characterized by a high mutation and recombination rate, which makes host jumping and cross-species transmission easy. In fact, increasing contact between different animal species fosters cross-species transmission, while agriculture intensification, animal trade and herd management are key drivers at the human-animal interface. If contacts with wild animals are still limited, humans have much more contact with farm animals, during breeding, transport, slaughter and food process, making CoVs a persistent threat to both humans and animals. A global network should be established for the surveillance and monitoring of animal CoVs.																					WOS:000572553100001	32976707

Cytokine Storm in COVID-19 Patients, Its Impact on Organs and Potential Treatment by QTY Code-Designed Detergent-Free Chemokine Receptors								MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION				2020						8198963	10.1155/2020/8198963				SEP 23 2020	2020	The novel coronavirus is not only causing respiratory problems, but it may also damage the heart, kidneys, liver, and other organs; in Wuhan, 14 to 30% of COVID-19 patients have lost their kidney function and now require either dialysis or kidney transplants. The novel coronavirus gains entry into humans by targeting the ACE2 receptor that found on lung cells, which destroy human lungs through cytokine storms, and this leads to hyperinflammation, forcing the immune cells to destroy healthy cells. This is why some COVID-19 patients need intensive care. The inflammatory chemicals released during COVID-19 infection cause the liver to produce proteins that defend the body from infections. However, these proteins can cause blood clotting, which can clog blood vessels in the heart and other organs; as a result, the organs are deprived of oxygen and nutrients which could ultimately lead to multiorgan failure and consequent progression to acute lung injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and often death. However, there are novel protein modification tools called the QTY code, which are similar in their structure to antibodies, which could provide a solution to excess cytokines. These synthetic proteins can be injected into the body to bind the excess cytokines created by the cytokine storm; this will eventually remove the excessive cytokines and inhibit the severe symptoms caused by the COVID-19 infection. In this review, we will focus on cytokine storm in COVID-19 patients, their impact on the body organs, and the potential treatment by QTY code-designed detergent-free chemokine receptors.

COVID-19 spread all over the word just a few months. The outbreak of COVID-19 infection poses major threat to international health and economy. World Health Organization (WHO) announced that the new coronavirus was an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020. However, with the spread of COVID-19, the routine medical care of lung cancer patients was affected. Because lung cancer patients have low immunity after anti-tumor treatment, they should become the main targets for epidemic prevention. Lung cancer patients are increasingly concerned about the prevention of COVID-19. It is necessary to provide individualized medical treatment and management for lung cancer patients based on patients' conditions and regional epidemic patterns.

It is believed that early reports of COVID-19 cases were noticed in December 2019 and soon after it became a global public health emergency. It is advised that COVID-19 transmits through human to human contact and in most cases, it remains asymptomatic. Several approaches are being utilized to control the outbreak of this fatal viral disease. microRNAs (miRNAs) are known signature therapeutic tool for the viral diseases; they are small non-coding RNAs that target the mRNAs to inhibit their post-transcriptional expression, therefore, impeding their functions, can serve as watchdogs or micromanagers in the cells. Areas covered This review work delineated COVID-19 and its association with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), the possible role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, and therapeutic potential of miRNAs and their effective delivery to treat COVID-19. Expert opinion This review highlighted the importance of various miRNAs and their potential role in fighting with this pandemic as therapeutic molecules utilizing nanotechnology.

Comparative genomics can inform a deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Previous strains of coronavirus, SARS-CoV, and Middle-East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have been known to cause acute lung injuries in humans. SARS-CoV-2 shares genetic similarity with SARS-CoV with some modification in the S protein leading to their enhanced binding affinity toward the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors of human lung cells. This expert review examines the features of all three coronaviruses through a conceptual lens of comparative genomics. In particular, the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 that enables its survival within the host is highlighted. Susceptibility of humans to coronavirus outbreaks in the 21st century calls for comparisons of the transmission history, hosts, reservoirs, and fatality rates of these viruses so that evidence-based and effective planetary health interventions can be devised to prevent future zoonotic outbreaks. Comparative genomics offers new insights on putative and novel viral targets with an eye to both therapeutic innovation and prevention. We conclude the expert review by (1) articulating the lessons learned so far, whereas the research is still being actively sought after in the field, and (2) the challenges and prospects in deciphering the linkages among multiomics biological variability and COVID-19 pathogenesis.

It is causing mass destruction in mankind allowing them to lock inside home to contain the disease. At present, there are no remedial medicines, drugs, or vaccines available in the market. Researchers are trying their best level to produce drugs to fight againts the disease. Various efforts are being considered by using different directions of scientific knowledge and technologies on treating the disease. The existing antiviral drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir, pitavastatin, nelfinavir, perampanel, and praziquantel are being administered as remedies of covid-19 patients. Unfortunately, none of these drugs works absolutely against the current pandemic. Therefore, bioactive molecules from plants, animals, and microorganisms could be a better option to treat against the covid-19 and its family. Plants can treat many diseases due to the presence of bioactive molecules and their antiviral properties. Presence of secondary metabolites such as flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, polyphenols, curcumin, kaempferol, catechin, naringenin, quercetin, apigenin-7-glucoside, luteolin-7-glucoside, demethoxycurcumin, oleuropein, and epigallocatechin can fight against the coronavirus including covid-19. The listed plants such as litchi seeds,Houttuynia cordata, Chinese Rhubarb extracts, beta-sistosterol fromIsatis indigoticaroot extract have capacity to obstruct the enzymatic activity of SARS. In this article, we have highlighted the bioactive molecules from different plants, animals, and microorganism and their potential activity against the coronavirus. It is a need of the hour to come together to explore more on such bioactive compounds of plants, animals and other microorganism to fight against the covid-19.

Initially, SARS-CoV-2 was considered a respiratory virus generally causing a mild disease, only severe and fatal in the elderly and individuals with underlying conditions. Severe illnesses and fatalities were attributed to a cytokine storm, an excessive response from the host immune system. However, with the number of infections over 10 millions and still soaring, the insidious and stealthy nature of the virus has emerged, as it causes a vast array of diverse unexpected symptoms among infected individuals, including the young and healthy. It has become evident that besides infecting the respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can affect many organs, possibly through the infection of the endothelium. This review presents an overview of our learning curve with the novel virus emergence, transmission, pathology, biological properties and host-interactions. It also briefly describes remedial measures taken until an effective vaccine is available, that is non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the viral spread and the repurposing of existing drugs, approved or in development for other conditions to eliminate the virus or mitigate the cytokine storm.

This virus disseminated rapidly and reached to an unprecedented pandemic proportion in more than 213 nations with a large number of fatalities. The hypersecretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines is the main cause of mortality and morbidity due to COVID-19, therefore strategies that avert the cytokine storm may play a crucial role in abating the severity of COVID-19. This review highlights the minute details of SARS-CoV-2, its genomic organization, genomic variations within structural and non-structural proteins and viral progression mechanism in human beings. The approaches like antiviral strategies are discussed, including drugs that obstruct viral propagation and suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. This compilation emphasizes Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) based therapy alone or in combination with other therapeutics as an attractive curative approach for COVID-19 pandemic. The MSCs and its secretome, including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have various capabilities, for instance, immunomodulation, regeneration, antimicrobial properties, potential for attenuating the cytokine storm and bare minimum chances of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immunomodulatory property of MSCs affects inflammatory state and regulates immune response during SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, as of now, there is no WHO-approved MSCs based therapy for the treatment of COVID-19 infection.																					WOS:000568637500001	32920752

The circadian day-night is the rhythmic clue to organisms for their synchronized body functions. The "development for mankind" escalated the use of artificial light at night (ALAN). In this article, we tried to focus on the possible influence of this anthropogenic factor in human coronavirus (HCoV) outbreak. The relationship between the occurrences of coronavirus and the ascending curve of the night-light has also been delivered. The ALAN influences the physiology and behavior of bat, a known nocturnal natural reservoir of manyCoronaviridae. The "threatened" and "endangered" status of the majority of bat species is mainly because of the destruction of their proper habit and habitat predominantly through artificial illumination. The stress exerted by ALAN leads to the impaired body functions, especially endocrine, immune, genomic integration, and overall rhythm features of different physiological variables and behaviors in nocturnal animals. Night-light disturbs "virus-host" synchronization and may lead to mutation in the genomic part of the virus and excessive virus shedding. We also proposed some future strategies to mitigate the repercussions of ALAN and for the protection of the living system in the earth as well.																					WOS:000574637700001	33013700

Globally, according to the latest World Health Organization report (10 August 2020), COVID-19 has affected nearly 20 million lives, causing 728 013 deaths. Due to the lack of specific therapeutic drugs and vaccines, the outbreak of disease has spawned a corpus of contagious infection all over the world, day by day, without control. As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a very rapid infection rate, it is essential to develop a novel ameliorative and curative strategy as quickly as possible. Convalescent plasma (CP) therapy is a type of adaptive immunity that has already been found to be effective in confronting several infectious diseases from the last two decades. For example, CP therapy was used in the treatment of viral-induced diseases like SARS-CoV epidemics, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) pandemics, Ebola epidemics and H1N1 pandemic. In this review, we have mainly focused on the therapeutic role of CP therapy and its neutralizing effect to fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.																					WOS:000571577500004	32898468

Pathways of the viral entry into cells are interesting subjects for targeted therapy of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The present study aims to provide a systematic evaluation of the most recent in vitro and in vivo investigations targeting SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. A systematic search was carried out in major medical sources, including MEDLINE (through PubMed), Web of Science, Scopus, and EMBASE. Combinations of the following search terms were used: SARS-CoV-2, in vitro, in vivo, preclinical, targeted therapy, and cell entry. A modified version of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Systematic Review Centre for Laboratory Animal Experimentation assessment tools were applied for evaluating the risk of bias of in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. A narrative synthesis was performed as a qualitative method for the data synthesis of each outcome measure. A total of 2,649 articles were identified through searching PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, Google Scholar, and Biorxiv. Finally, 22 studies (one in vivo study and 21 in vitro studies) were included. The spike (S) glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 was the main target of investigation in 19 studies. SARS-CoV-2 can enter into the host cells through endocytosis or independently. SARS-CoV-2 S protein utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or CD147 as its cell-surface receptor to attach host cells. It consists of S1 and S2 subunits. The S1 subunit mediates viral attachment to the host cells, while the S2 subunit facilitates virus-host membrane fusion. The cleavage of the S1-S2 protein, which is required for the conformational changes of the S2 subunit and processing of viral fusion, is regulated by the host proteases, including cathepsin L (during endocytosis) and type II membrane serine protease (independently). Targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non-endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry. Inhibition of the viral entry by targeting host or virus-related components remains the most potent strategy to prevent and treat COVID-19. Further high-quality investigations are needed to assess the efficacy of the proposed targets and develop specific antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.																					WOS:000567435500001	32901936

BIOMOLECULES				10	9					1312	10.3390/biom10091312				SEP 2020	2020	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The worldwide transmission of COVID-19 from human to human is spreading like wildfire, affecting almost every country in the world. In the past 100 years, the globe did not face a microbial pandemic similar in scale to COVID-19. Taken together, both previous outbreaks of other members of the coronavirus family (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV)) did not produce even 1% of the global harm already inflicted by COVID-19. There are also four other CoVs capable of infecting humans (HCoVs), which circulate continuously in the human population, but their phenotypes are generally mild, and these HCoVs received relatively little attention. These dramatic differences between infection with HCoVs, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 raise many questions, such as: Why is COVID-19 transmitted so quickly? Is it due to some specific features of the viral structure? Are there some specific human (host) factors? Are there some environmental factors? The aim of this review is to collect and concisely summarize the possible and logical answers to these questions.																					WOS:000581238300001	32933047

Human pegivirus (HPgV) is a single-strand RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae. Although no definitive association between HPgV infection and disease has been identified, previous studies have suggested an association of HPgV viremia with risk of lymphomas.Methods. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 1 cohort study and 14 case-control studies, assessing the association of HPgV viremia with adult lymphomas. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model, overall and by geographic region and lymphoma subtype.Results. The overall OR for lymphoma was 2.85 (95% CI, 1.98-4.11), with statistically significantly elevated ORs observed in 8 of 15 studies. There was a small amount of heterogeneity among studies (I-2 = 28.9%; Q = 18.27, P = .16), and the funnel plot provided no evidence for publication bias. The strongest association with lymphoma risk was observed for studies from Southern Europe (OR, 5.68 [95% CI, 1.98-16.3]), whereas weaker ORs (with 95% CIs) were observed for studies from North America (2.24 [1.76-2.85]), Northern Europe (2.90 [.45-18.7), and the Middle East (2.51 [.87-7.27]), but all of similar magnitude. Participants with HPgV viremia had statistically significantly increased risks (OR [95% CI]) for developing diffuse large B-cell (3.29 [1.63-6.62]), follicular (3.01 [1.95-4.63]), marginal zone (1.90 [1.13-3.18]), and T-cell (2.11 [1.17-3.89]) lymphomas, while the risk for Hodgkin lymphoma (3.53 [.48-25.9]) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1.45 [.45-4.66]) were increased but did not achieve statistical significance.Conclusions. This meta-analysis supports a positive association of HPgV viremia with lymphoma risk, overall and for the major lymphoma subtypes.																					WOS:000577168600014	31671178

As with a number of zoonotic pathogens, there is a risk of spillover into novel hosts. Here, we propose a hypothesized conceptual model that illustrates the mechanism whereby the SARS-CoV-2 could spillover from infected humans to naive wildlife hosts in North America. This proposed model is premised on transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from human feces through municipal waste water treatment plants into the natural aquatic environment where potential wildlife hosts become infected. We use the existing literature on human coronaviruses, including SARS CoV, to support the potential pathways and mechanisms in the conceptual model. Although we focus on North America, our conceptual model could apply to other parts of the globe as well.																					WOS:000540271100020	32416535

Of 116 aquatic habitats surveyed, 48 were positive for larvae of Culex pipiens L. (76.3%) and Cx. quinquefasciatus (23.7%). Habitats formed of rain-filled pools (93.8%) and leaking underground pump (6.2%) were positive for Culex larvae. Significantly, shallow water, mud bottom, and absence of grasses, algae, and predators were the common characteristics of habitats positive for Culex larvae (P<0.05). Culex larvae were also found to thrive better in stagnant habitats that devoid of solid wastes and fully exposed to sunlight.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent for COVID-19, has proved to be a great challenge for its ability to spread in asymptomatic stages and the diverse disease spectrum it has generated. This has created a challenge of unimaginable magnitude, not only affecting human health and life but also potentially generating a long-lasting socioeconomic impact. Both medical sciences and biomedical research have also been challenged, consequently leading to a large number of clinical trials and vaccine initiatives. While known proteins of pathobiological importance are targets for these therapeutic approaches, it is imperative to explore other factors of viral significance. Accessory proteins are one such trait that have diverse roles in coronavirus pathobiology. Here, we analyze certain genomic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 accessory protein ORF8 and predict its protein features. We have further reviewed current available literature regarding its function and comparatively evaluated these and other features of ORF8 and ORF8ab, its homolog from SARS-CoV. Because coronaviruses have been infecting humans repeatedly and might continue to do so, we therefore expect this study to aid in the development of holistic understanding of these proteins. Despite low nucleotide and protein identity and differentiating genome level characteristics, there appears to be significant structural integrity and functional proximity between these proteins pointing towards their high significance. There is further need for comprehensive genomics and structural-functional studies to lead towards definitive conclusions regarding their criticality and that can eventually define their relevance to therapeutics development.

The recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that affected more than 215 countries with over 23 million cases and 800,000 deaths as of today. The situation is critical, especially with the absence of specific medicines or vaccines; hence, efforts toward the development of anti-COVID-19 medicines are being intensively undertaken. One of the potential therapeutic targets of anti-COVID-19 drugs is the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 was identified as a key functional receptor for CoV associated with COVID-19. ACE2, which is located on the surface of the host cells, binds effectively to the spike protein of CoV, thus enabling the virus to infect the epithelial cells of the host. Previous studies showed that certain flavonoids exhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition activity, which plays a crucial role in the regulation of arterial blood pressure. Thus, it is being postulated that these flavonoids might also interact with ACE2. This postulation might be of interest because these compounds also show antiviral activity in vitro. This article summarizes the natural flavonoids with potential efficacy against COVID-19 through ACE2 receptor inhibition.																					WOS:000569578700001	32882868

Despite close pet-human contact, little is known about the predisposition of pets to SARS-CoV-2. Among these, felines are the most susceptible. In this study, a domestic cat with clear clinical signs of pneumonia, confirmed by Rx imaging, was found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 using quantitative RT-qPCR from a nasal swab. This is the first Italian study responding to the request of the scientific community to focus attention on the possible role of pets as a viral reservoir. An important question remains unanswered: did the cat actually die due to SARS-CoV-2 infection?																					WOS:000580119600001	32932800

J.; Kirchhoff, Frank								SARS-CoV-2 Is Restricted by Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein despite Preadaptation to the Low-CpG Environment in Humans								MBIO				11	5					e01930-20	10.1128/mBio.01930-20				SEP-OCT 2020	2020	Recent evidence shows that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is sensitive to interferons (IFNs). However, the most effective types of IFNs and the underlying antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP), which preferentially targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences, restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further demonstrate that ZAP and its cofactors KHNYN and TRIM25 are expressed in human lung cells. Type I, II, and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Comprehensive sequence analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from horseshoe bats showed the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Nevertheless, endogenous ZAP expression restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells, particularly upon treatment with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma. Both the long and the short isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA expression levels, but the former did so with greater efficiency. Finally, we show that the ability to restrict SARS-CoV-2 is conserved in ZAP orthologues of the reservoir bat and potential intermediate pangolin hosts of human coronaviruses. Altogether, our results show that ZAP is an important effector of the innate response against SARS-CoV-2, although this pandemic pathogen emerged from zoonosis of a coronavirus that was preadapted to the low-CpG environment in humans.IMPORTANCE Although interferons inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and have been evaluated for treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the most effective types and antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that IFN-gamma is particularly potent in restricting SARS-CoV-2 and in inducing expression of the antiviral factor ZAP in human lung cells. Knockdown experiments revealed that endogenous ZAP significantly restricts SARS-CoV-2. We further show that CpG dinucleotides which are specifically targeted by ZAP are strongly suppressed in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and that the two closest horseshoe bat relatives of SARS-CoV-2 show the lowest genomic CpG content of all coronavirus sequences available from this reservoir host. Nonetheless, both the short and long isoforms of human ZAP reduced SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, and this activity was conserved in horseshoe bat and pangolin ZAP orthologues. Our findings indicating that type II interferon is particularly efficient against SARS-CoV-2 and that ZAP restricts this pandemic viral pathogen might promote the development of effective immune therapies against COVID-19.

COVID-19 is an emerging zoonosis caused by SARS-CoV-2, a new coronavirus whose primary source is associated with bats. Its rapid global expansion led the World Health Organization (WHO) to consider the disease as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), for which the cross-sectoral approach is necessary. The "One Health" strategy, promoted by the international organizations FAO, OIE and WHO, promotes collaborative efforts at all levels across multiple disciplines and sectors to achieve optimal health for people, animals and the environment, thus providing a conceptual framework for the development of cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary solutions to global health challenges. This approach reviews the latest research reports on crucial aspects in the epidemiology of this new zoonosis, such as the characteristics of coronaviruses, their hosts, factors after crossing the interspecies barrier, and the undefined aspects of SARS-CoV-2 with potential implications for its prevention and control, as well as the lack of knowledge of the intermediate host of the virus, an important link in the epidemiological chain and the role that wild and domestic animal species, including pets, can have in the persistence of the virus in the environment and its potential re-emergence. It also addresses the necessary cooperation between human and animal health services in activities to face COVID-19, while pointing out its negative economic impact on the entire food production and distribution chain. This is an example of the importance of the holistic vision proposed by the "One Health" approach in the prevention and control of zoonoses, benefiting the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by all countries, by proposing that healthy people and animals live in a healthy planet. There is a need of strengthening capacity building and cooperation between the human and animal health sectors, as well as their preparedness to face future health emergencies.

J	Preziuso, Silvia								Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Exhibits High Predicted Binding Affinity to ACE2 from Lagomorphs (Rabbits and Pikas)								ANIMALS				10	9					1460	10.3390/ani10091460				SEP 2020	2020	Simple SummarySevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic COVID-19. The virus infects human cells by binding of the virus spike to the cell receptor ACE2. Some studies suggest that dogs, cats and other animal species could be infected by SARS-CoV-2, while very limited data are available on lagomorphs. There are several occasions where rabbits and other lagomorphs are in close contact with humans. To investigate the interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spikes and ACE2 of lagomorphs, predictive computer-based models were used in this study. The structure of ACE2 of lagomorphs was obtained on the basis of the amino acid sequences computationally. The interaction with the model of SARS-CoV-2 spikes was studied and described in depth on the basis of the complex human ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 published before. The interaction among SARS-CoV-2 spikes and ACE2 of other companion or laboratory animals is also described for comparative purposes. The results predict that ACE2 of lagomorphs are likely to bind SARS-CoV-2 spikes and suggest that further studies would be justified to confirm these results and to evaluate the risks to humans being in close contact with lagomorphs, such as veterinarians, farmers, slaughterhouse workers, butchers or pet owners.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the pandemic COVID-19. The virus infects human cells by binding of the virus spike to the cell receptor ACE2. The crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spikes in complex with human ACE2 has recently been solved, and the main amino acid residues involved in the virus-receptor complex have been detected. To investigate the affinity of ACE2 of lagomorphs to the SARS-CoV-2 spike, ACE2 sequences from rabbits and American pikas were compared with human ACE2 and with ACE2 from mammals with different susceptibility to the virus. Models of the complex formed by SARS-CoV-2 spike and ACE2 from lagomorphs and from other mammals were created for comparative studies. ACE2 of lagomorphs showed fewer substitutions than human ACE2 in residues involved in the ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike complex, similar to cats. Analysis of the binding interface of the simulated complexes ACE2-SARS-CoV-2 spike showed high affinity of the ACE2 of lagomorphs to the viral spike protein. These findings suggest that the spike of SARS-CoV-2 could bind the ACE2 receptor of lagomorphs, and future studies should investigate the role of lagomorphs in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology. Furthermore, the risks to humans coming into close contacts with these animals should be evaluated.																					WOS:000581216900001	32825305

R.; Ruiz, Tamara; Fernandez-Pacheco, Paloma; Angel Jimenez-Clavero, Miguel; Djadjovski, Igor; Moreno, Sandra; Brun, Alejandro; Edwards, Thomas A.; Barr, John N.; Rueda, Paloma; Sastre, Patricia								Development of a multiplex assay for antibody detection in serum against pathogens affecting ruminants								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				68	3			1229	1239		10.1111/tbed.13776		AUG 2020		MAY 2021	2021	Numerous infectious diseases impacting livestock impose an important economic burden and in some cases also represent a threat to humans and are classified as zoonoses. Some zoonotic diseases are transmitted by vectors and, due to complex environmental and socio-economic factors, the distribution of many of these pathogens is changing, with increasing numbers being found in previously unaffected countries. Here, we developed a multiplex assay, based on a suspension microarray, able to detect specific antibodies to five important pathogens of livestock (three of them zoonotic) that are currently emerging in new geographical locations: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and the bacteria complexMycobacterium tuberculosis. Using the Luminex platform, polystyrene microspheres were coated with recombinant proteins from each of the five pathogens. The mix of microspheres was used for the simultaneous detection of antibodies against the five corresponding diseases affecting ruminants. The following panel of sera was included in the study: 50 sera from sheep experimentally infected with RVFV, 74 sera from calves and lambs vaccinated with SBV, 26 sera from cattle vaccinated withMycobacterium bovis, 30 field sera from different species of ruminants infected with CCHFV and 88 calf sera infected with BTV. Finally, to determine its diagnostic specificity 220 field sera from Spanish farms free of the five diseases were assessed. All the sera were classified using commercial ELISAs specific for each disease, used in this study as the reference technique. The results showed the multiplex assay exhibited good performance characteristics with values of sensitivity ranging from 93% to 100% and of specificity ranging from 96% to 99% depending on the pathogen. This new tool allows the simultaneous detection of antibodies against five important pathogens, reducing the volume of sample needed and the time of analysis where these pathogens are usually tested individually.

It affected 8,096 humans with a death rate of 11% affecting 21 countries. The receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein of this virus gets attached with the ACE2 receptors present on human cells. MERS CoV was first reported in 2012 in Middle East, originated from bat and transmitted to humans through camels. MERS CoV has a fatality rate of 35% and last case reported was in 2017 making a total of 1,879 cases worldwide. DPP4 expressed on human cells is the main attaching site for RBD in S protein of MERS CoV. Folding of RBD plays a crucial role in its pathogenesis. Virus causing COVID-19 was named as SARS CoV-2 due its homology with SARS CoV that emerged in 2003. It has become a pandemic affecting nearly 200 countries in just 3 months' time with a death rate of 2-3% currently. The new virus is fast spreading, but it utilizes the same RBD and ACE2 receptors along with furin present in human cells. The lessons learned from the SARS and MERS epidemics are the best social weapons to face and fight against this novel global threat.																					WOS:000570594200001	32974224

Rift Valley Fever Virus Is Lethal in Different Inbred Mouse Strains Independent of Sex								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				11						1962	10.3389/fmicb.2020.01962				AUG 21 2020	2020	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting humans and livestock in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The majority of human cases are mild and self-limiting; however, severe cases can result in hepatitis, encephalitis, or hemorrhagic fever. There is a lack of immunocompetent mouse models that faithfully recapitulate the varied clinical outcomes of RVF in humans. However, there are easily accessible and commonly used inbred mouse strains that have never been challenged with wild-type RVFV. Here, RVFV susceptibility and pathogenesis were evaluated across five commonly used inbred laboratory mouse strains: C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvlmJ, NOD/ShiLtJ, A/J, and NZO/HILtJ. Comparisons between different mouse strains, challenge doses, and sexes revealed exquisite susceptibility to wild-type RVFV in an almost uniform manner. Never before challenged NOD/ShiLtJ, A/J, and NZO/HILtJ mice showed similar phenotypes of Rift Valley fever disease as previously tested inbred mouse strains. The majority of infected mice died or were euthanized by day 5 post-infection due to overwhelming hepatic disease as evidenced by gross liver pathology and high viral RNA loads in the liver. Mice surviving past day 6 across all strains succumbed to late-onset encephalitis. Remarkably, sex was not found to impact survival or viral load and showed only modest effect on time to death and weight loss for any of the challenged mouse strains following RVFV infection. Regardless of sex, these inbred mouse strains displayed extreme susceptibility to wild-type RVFV down to one virus particle.																					WOS:000568294400001	32973712

SRS-8-S-2018								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				11						1923	10.3389/fmicb.2020.01923				AUG 20 2020	2020	The carriage of both, heavy metal and antibiotic resistance appears to be a common trait in bacterial communities native to long-term contaminated habitats, including the Savannah River Site (SRS). There is widespread soil contamination at the SRS; a United States Department of Energy (DOE) facility with long-term contamination from past industrial and nuclear weapons production activities. To further evaluate the genomic and metabolic traits that underpin metal and antibiotic resistance, a robust mercury (Hg) and uranium (U)-resistant strain- SRS-8-S-2018, was isolated. Minimum inhibitory concentration of this strain revealed resistance to Hg (10 mu g/ml) and U (5 mM), the two main heavy metal contaminants at the SRS. Metabolic assessment of strain SRS-8-S-2018 using Biolog metabolic fingerprinting analysis revealed preference for carbohydrate utilization followed by polymers, amino acids, carboxy acids, and esters; this physiological activity diminished when Hg stress was provided at 1 and 3 mu g/ml and completely ceased at 5 mu g/ml Hg, indicating that continued release of Hg will have negative metabolic impacts to even those microorganisms that possess high resistance ability. Development of antibiotic resistance in strain SRS-8-S-2018 was evaluated at a functional level using phenomics, which confirmed broad resistance against 70.8% of the 48 antibiotics tested. Evolutionary and adaptive traits of strain SRS-8-S-2018 were further assessed using genomics, which revealed the strain to taxonomically affiliate withSerratia marcescensspecies, possessing a genome size of 5,323,630 bp, 5,261 proteins (CDS), 55 genes for transfer RNA (tRNA), and an average G + C content of 59.48. Comparative genomics with closest taxonomic relatives revealed 360 distinct genes in SRS-8-S-2018, with multiple functions related to both, antibiotic and heavy metal resistance, which likely facilitates the strain's survival in a metalliferous soil habitat. Comparisons drawn between the environmentally isolatedSerratiaSRS-8-S-2018 with 31 other strains revealed a closer functional association with medically relevant isolates suggesting that propensity of environmentalSerratiaisolates in acquiring virulence traits, as a function of long-term exposure to heavy metals, which is facilitating development, recruitment and proliferation of not only metal resistant genes (MRGs) but antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs), which can potentially trigger future bacterial pathogen outbreaks emanating from contaminated environmental habitats.

Enhanced surveillance has been implemented since 2010, to promptly characterise cases' temporal and geographical distribution and inform authorities for implementation of appropriate measures (mosquito control, health education, blood safety). Aim: We describe the epidemiology of WNV human infections in Greece focusing on the 2018 season. Methods: The National Public Health Organization advised physicians to test all suspect WNV infection cases and refer samples to reference laboratories. Laboratories notified diagnosed cases on a daily basis. Treating physicians, patients, and infected blood donors were interviewed within 48 hours after diagnosis and the probable infection location was identified. Hospitalised cases were followed up until discharge. Results: A total of 317 autochthonous WNV infection cases were diagnosed in 2018. Among them, 243 cases had neuroinvasive disease (WNND), representing a 23% increase of WNND cases compared with 2010, the previous most intense season. There were 51 deaths. Cases started occurring from week 22, earlier than usual. Both rural and urban areas were affected, with 86 (26% of the total) municipalities belonging to seven (54% of the total) regions recording cases. Two major epicentres were identified in Attica and Central Macedonia regions. Conclusions: The largest number of human cases of WNV infection ever recorded in Greece occurred in 2018, with a wide geographical distribution, suggesting intense virus circulation. Enhanced surveillance is vital for the early detection of human cases and the prompt implementation of response measures.																					WOS:000563781500003	32794446

The infection induces mild or sometimes severe acute respiratory diseases. Nowadays, the appearance of a new, highly pathogenic and lethal coronavirus variant, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for a pandemic (COVID-19), represents a global problem for human health. Unfortunately, only limited approaches are available to treat coronavirus infections and a vaccine against this new coronavirus variant is not yet available. The plasma membrane microdomain lipid rafts have been found by researchers to be involved in the replication cycle of numerous viruses, including coronaviruses. Indeed, some pathogen recognition receptors for coronaviruses as for other viruses cluster into lipid rafts, and it is therefore conceivable that the first contact between virus and host cells occurs into these specialized regions, representing a port of cell entry for viruses. Recent data highlighted the peculiar pro-viral or anti-viral role played by autophagy in the host immune responses to viral infections. Coronaviruses, like other viruses, were reported to be able to exploit the autophagic machinery to increase their replication or to inhibit the degradation of viral products. Agents known to disrupt lipid rafts, such as metil-beta-cyclodextrins or statins, as well as autophagy inhibitor agents, were shown to have an anti-viral role. In this review, we briefly describe the involvement of lipid rafts and autophagy in coronavirus infection and replication. We also hint how lipid rafts and autophagy may represent a potential therapeutic target to be investigated for the treatment of coronavirus infections.

The CoV spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) is an attractive vaccine target but is undermined by limited immunogenicity. We describe a dimeric form of MERS-CoV RBD that overcomes this limitation. The RBD-dimer significantly increased neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers compared to conventional monomeric form and protected mice against MERS-CoV infection. Crystal structure showed RBD-dimer fully exposed dual receptor-binding motifs, the major target for NAbs. Structureguided design further yielded a stable version of RBD-dimer as a tandem repeat single-chain (RBD-sc-dimer) which retained the vaccine potency. We generalized this strategy to design vaccines against COVID-19 and SARS, achieving 10- to 100-fold enhancement of NAb titers. RBD-sc-dimers in pilot scale production yielded high yields, supporting their scalability for further clinical development. The framework of immunogen design can be universally applied to other beta-CoV vaccines to counter emerging threats.																					WOS:000558649000016	32645327

Our objective is to optimize a method for the isolation and culture of primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) and to provide an ex vivo model to study mechanisms of epithelial airway inflammation. PBECs were isolated and cultured from the airways of calves in a submerged cell culture and liquid-liquid interface system. A higher yield and cell viability were obtained after stripping the epithelium from the bronchial section compared to cutting the bronchial section in smaller pieces prior to digestion. Mannheimia haemolytica and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as stimulants increased inflammatory responses (IL-8, IL-6 and TNF-alpha release), possibly, by the activation of "TLR-mediated MAPKs and NF-kappa B" signaling. Furthermore, M. haemolytica and LPS disrupted the bronchial epithelial layer as observed by a decreased transepithelial electrical resistance and zonula occludens-1 and E-cadherin expression. An optimized isolation and culture method for calf PBECs was developed, which cooperated with animal use Replacement, Reduction and Refinement (3R's) principle, and can also contribute to the increased knowledge and development of effective therapies for other animal and humans (childhood) respiratory diseases.

Among the new approaches that could be tested, that relying on nanotechnology finds one of its main grounds in the similarity between nanoparticle (NP) and coronavirus (COV) sizes, which promotes NP-COV interactions. Since COVID-19 is very recent, most studies in this field have focused on other types of coronavirus than COVID-19, such as those involved in MERS or SARS diseases. Although their number is limited, they have led to promising results on various COV using a wide range of different types of nanosystems, e.g., nanoparticles, quantum dos, or nanoassemblies of polymers/proteins. Additional efforts deserve to be spent in this field to consolidate these findings. Here, I first summarize the different nanotechnology-based methods used for COV detection, i.e., optical, electrical, or PCR ones, whose sensitivity was improved by the presence of nanoparticles. Furthermore, I present vaccination methods, which comprise nanoparticles used either as adjuvants or as active principles. They often yield a better-controlled immune response, possibly due to an improved antigen presentation/processing than in non-nanoformulated vaccines. Certain antiviral approaches also took advantage of nanoparticle uses, leading to specific mechanisms such as the blocking of virus replication at the cellular level or the reduction of a COV induced apoptotic cellular death.

Sera from 570 zoo animals belonging to 120 mammal species were collected at ten zoos (A-J) in Spain between 2002 and 2019. Twenty-one of these animals, belonging to ten different species, were sampled longitudinally at four of the zoos during the study period. Antigenically-related flavivirus antibodies were detected in 19 (3.3 %; 95 %CI: 2.0-5.2) of the 570 animals analyzed using bELISA. Seropositivity was observed in ten (8.3 %) of the 120 species tested. Five (23.8 %) of the 21 animals sampled more than once presented seropositivity in all samplings whereas seroconversion was only observed in one white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum). Flavivirus antibodies were found at six of the ten sampled zoos and in consecutive years between 2008 and 2018. Virus neutralization tests confirmed West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection in ten (1.8 %; 95 %CI: 0.7-2.8), five (0.9 %; 95 %CI: 0.1-1.6) and one (0.2 %; 95 %CI: 0.0-0.5) animal, respectively. Antibodies against Meaban virus (0 %; 95 %CI: 0.0-0.7 %) were not found in the tested sera. The results demonstrate WNV, USUV and TBEV exposure in zoo mammals, which may be of public health and conservation concern. Seropositivity to WNV and USUV was detected in regions where these viruses have not been reported previously. Anti-WNV antibodies found in zoo animals sampled in 2009 point to WNV circulation at least one year before the first outbreaks were reported in horses and humans in Spain. Our results indicate that zoo mammals could be useful sentinel species for monitoring emerging flavivirus activity in urban areas.																					WOS:000558156400028	32768215

However, the potential contribution of foods to consumers' health has so far only been partially exploited. The rapidly evolving scenario of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is stimulating profound reflection on the relationships between food and the etiological agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here, the status of knowledge regarding food as a possible defense/co-therapeutic strategy against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is considered through the discussion of two main current lines of research. One line of research relates to the role of micronutrients, food components, and diets in the strengthening of the immune system through clinical trials; formulations could be developed as immune system enhancers or as co-adjuvants in therapies. The other line of research relates to investigation of the chemical interactions that specific food compounds can have with host or virus targets so as to interfere with the viral infective cycle of SARS-CoV-2. This line requires, as a first step, an in silico evaluation to discover lead compounds, which may be further developed through drug-design studies, in vitro and in vivo tests, and, finally, clinical trials to obtain therapeutic molecules. All of these promising strategies promote the role of food in preventive/co-therapeutic strategies to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.																					WOS:000564699400001	32752217

Bats have been recognized as an important reservoir of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs). In West Africa, where there is a high diversity of bat species, little is known on the circulation of CoVs in these hosts, especially at the interface with human populations. In this study, in Guinea, we tested a total of 319 bats belonging to 14 genera and six families of insectivorous and frugivorous bats across the country, for the presence of coronaviruses. We found CoVs in 35 (11%) of the tested bats-in three insectivorous bat species and five fruit bat species that were mostly captured close to human habitat. Positivity rates varied from 5.7% to 100%, depending on bat species. A wide diversity of alpha and beta coronaviruses was found across the country, including three sequences belonging to SarbeCoVs and MerbeCoVs subgenera known to harbor highly pathogenic human coronaviruses. Our findings suggest that CoVs are widely spread in West Africa and their circulation should be assessed to evaluate the risk of exposure of potential zoonotic CoVs to humans.

J	Saleh, Fatima; Harb, Aya; Soudani, Nadia; Zaraket, Hassan								A three-dimensional A549 cell culture model to study respiratory syncytial virus infections								JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND PUBLIC HEALTH				13	8			1142	1147		10.1016/j.jiph.2020.03.011				AUG 2020	2020	Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a primary cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, affecting infants, young children, and immune-compromised patients; however, currently no vaccine is available for prevention of RSV infections. The overwhelming majority of our knowledge of how RSV causes infection is based upon studies that have been carried out using traditional 2D methods, with cells cultured on flat plastic dishes. Although these simplified culture systems are essential to gain an insight into the fundamentals of host-pathogen interactions, cells in 2D are not exposed to the same conditions as cells in 3D tissues in the body and are therefore a poor representation of thein vivo microenvironment. In this study, we aim to develop the first 3D culture model for RSV infection using A549 cells to test its utility for RSV pathogenesis.Methods: To generate spheroids, A549 cells were cultured using ultra-low attachment plates to generate 25 x 10(3) cell spheroids. The viability of the spheroids was assessed by trypan blue exclusion assay and flow cytometry showing prominent live cells throughout the spheroids confirming high viability over seven days of incubation.Results: Immunostaining of A549 spheroids inoculated with RSV, showed time-dependent dissemination of the viral antigen RSV-F within the spheroid, resulting in syncytia formation and a 3-fold increase in mucin secretion compared to the uninfected cells. Additionally, RSV successfully replicated in the spheroids producing infectious virus as early as day one post-inoculation and was sustained for up to 7 days post-inoculation.Conclusions: Results show that A549 spheroids are susceptible and permissive for RSV since they exhibit the characteristics of RSV infection including syncytia formation and mucin overexpression, suggesting that A549 spheroids can be used a promising model for studying RSV in vitro.

J	Sebina, Ismail; Phipps, Simon								The Contribution of Neutrophils to the Pathogenesis of RSV Bronchiolitis								VIRUSES-BASEL				12	8					808	10.3390/v12080808				AUG 2020	2020	Acute viral bronchiolitis causes significant mortality in the developing world, is the number one cause of infant hospitalisation in the developed world, and is associated with the later development of chronic lung diseases such as asthma. A vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of viral bronchiolitis in infancy, remains elusive, and hence new therapeutic modalities are needed to limit disease severity. However, much remains unknown about the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Neutrophilic inflammation is the predominant phenotype observed in infants with both mild and severe disease, however, a clear understanding of the beneficial and deleterious effects of neutrophils is lacking. In this review, we describe the multifaceted roles of neutrophils in host defence and antiviral immunity, consider their contribution to bronchiolitis pathogenesis, and discuss whether new approaches that target neutrophil effector functions will be suitable for treating severe RSV bronchiolitis.

A palindromic RNA sequence as a common breakpoint contributor to copy-choice recombination in SARS-COV-2								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				165	10			2341	2348		10.1007/s00705-020-04750-z		JUL 2020		OCT 2020	2020	Much remains unknown concerning the origin of the novel pandemic coronavirus that has raged across the globe since emerging in Wuhan of Hubei province, near the center of the People's Republic of China, in December of 2019. All current members of the familyCoronaviridaehave arisen by a combination of incremental adaptive mutations, against the backdrop of many recombinational events throughout the past, rendering each a unique mosaic of RNA sequences from diverse sources. The consensus among virologists is that the base sequence of the novel coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, was derived from a common ancestor of a bat coronavirus, represented by the strain RaTG13, isolated in Yunnan province in 2013. Into that ancestral genetic background, several recombination events have since occurred from other divergent bat-derived coronaviruses, resulting in localized discordance between the two. One such event left SARS-CoV-2 with a receptor binding domain (RBD) capable of binding the human ACE-2 receptor lacking in RaTG13, and a second event uniquely added to SARS-CoV-2 a site specific for furin, capable of efficient endoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the spike glycoprotein responsible for virus entry and cell fusion. This paper demonstrates by bioinformatic analysis that such recombinational events are facilitated by short oligonucleotide "breakpoint sequences", similar to CAGAC, that direct recombination naturally to certain positions in the genome at the boundaries between blocks of RNA code and potentially RNA structure. This "breakpoint sequence hypothesis" provides a natural explanation for the biogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 over time and in the wild.																					WOS:000554330900001	32737584

The UK Veterinary Immunological Toolbox Website: promoting vaccine research by facilitating communication and removing reagent barriers								IMMUNOLOGY				161	1			25	27		10.1111/imm.13227		JUL 2020		SEP 2020	2020	Using the best animal models to study immune responses against specific pathogens or vaccines can dramatically accelerate our understanding. Veterinary species are well studied, particularly livestock, to reduce their disease burden. They have also proven to be powerful models, especially for zoonotic pathogens and novel vaccination strategies. A prerequisite for any model selection is having the right quality and range of species-specific immunological reagents. To help promote the widest possible use of veterinary species, an open access website () has been created as a central community annotated hub for veterinary immunological reagents. The website is also the portal into services offered by the UK Immunological Toolbox project that includes antibody generation, sequencing and recombinant expression. The funding for this effort is linked into sustainable sources, but ultimate success relies on community engagement to continually increase the quality and quantity of information. It is hoped that as more users and reagent owners engage, it will become an essential resource for researchers, veterinarians and clinicians alike by removing barriers that prevent the use of the most informative animal models.

Since its first outbreak in 1930, RVF epidemics have caused huge economic losses and public health impacts in Africa. In 2000, RVF became a disease of global concern as it spread to the Arabian Peninsula. In our study, a Geographic Information System-based risk assessment for the occurrence of Rift Valley fever in China was established by means of ecological niche modelling. Based on occurrence records (RVF records from FAO EMPRES-i, vector records from literatures and GBIF) and high-resolution environmental layers, the prediction maps of RVF occurrence probability and distribution of five potential RVF vectors in China were modelled using Maxent. An internal validation was adopted for model verification, and high AUC values were obtained (0.918 for RVF and 0.837-0.992 for vectors). By overlaying the RVF prediction map with the combined RVF vector prediction map using Fuzzy overlay tool ('AND' operator) of ArcMap 10.2, we got the first risk map of possible RVF vector transmission. This map was further overlaid with the latest livestock distribution map ('AND' operator) to generate the second risk map of possible RVF threat to domestic livestock. The south-west border provinces in China, Yunnan, Guangxi and Tibet were predicted to have a high possibility of RVF occurrence. Conditions conducive to the local amplification of RVF also exist in these areas. Temperature seasonality, mean temperature of dry season and precipitation of the driest month were considered as key environmental variables for RVF, and common environmental conditions were found conductive for vectors. It is suggested to establish proper surveillance systems in south-west border areas to minimize the possibility of RVF invasion. Our findings can serve as a valuable reference for prevention measures to be implemented.																					WOS:000547298100001	32568445

The new coronavirus responsible for this outbreak-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-shares high sequence identity to SARS-CoV and a bat coronavirus, RaTG13(2). Although bats may be the reservoir host for a variety of coronaviruses(3,4), it remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 has additional host species. Here we show that a coronavirus, which we name pangolin-CoV, isolated from a Malayan pangolin has 100%, 98.6%, 97.8% and 90.7% amino acid identity with SARS-CoV-2 in the E, M, N and S proteins, respectively. In particular, the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of pangolin-CoV is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV-2, with one difference in a noncritical amino acid. Our comparative genomic analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may have originated in the recombination of a virus similar to pangolin-CoV with one similar to RaTG13. Pangolin-CoV was detected in 17 out of the 25 Malayan pangolins that we analysed. Infected pangolins showed clinical signs and histological changes, and circulating antibodies against pangolin-CoV reacted with the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. The isolation of a coronavirus from pangolins that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2 suggests that these animals have the potential to act as an intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. This newly identified coronavirus from pangolins-the most-trafficked mammal in the illegal wildlife trade-could represent a future threat to public health if wildlife trade is not effectively controlled.

In June and July 2018, 22,985 mosquitoes and 57,500 midges were collected in Jiangxi Province in southeastern China. Among them, six strains of ZIKV were isolated from mosquitoes: four fromAn. sinensisand two fromCx. tritaeniorhynchus. Molecular genetic analysis showed that the ZIKV isolated fromAn. sinensisandCx. tritaeniorhynchusbelonged to genotype 2 in the Asian evolutionary branch of ZIKV. In addition, the ZIKV strains isolated fromAn. sinensisandCx. tritaeniorhynchushad amino acid substitutions identical to ZIKV strains prevalent in South America since 2015. This study is the first to isolate ZIKV from mosquito specimens collected in the wild of Jiangxi Province, China; This is also the first time that ZIKV has been isolated fromAn. sinensisandCx. tritaeniorhynchus. Given thatAn. sinensisandCx.tritaeniorhynchushave a very wide geographical distribution in China and even in eastern and southern Asia, the isolation of several strains of ZIKV from these two mosquitoes poses new challenges for the prevention and control of ZIKV infection in the mainland of China and countries and regions with the same distribution of mosquitoes.

Evidence for SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Animal Hosts								PATHOGENS				9	7					529	10.3390/pathogens9070529				JUL 2020	2020	COVID-19 is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the third virus in the family Coronaviridae to cause fatal infections in humans after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals.

Artificial modification of CpG frequency is a valid approach for live attenuated vaccine development; if this is to be applied to SARS-CoV-2, we must first understand the role CpG motifs play in regulating SARS-CoV-2 replication. Accordingly, the CpG composition of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was characterised. CpG suppression among coronaviruses does not differ between virus genera but does vary with host species and primary replication site (a proxy for tissue tropism), supporting the hypothesis that viral CpG content may influence cross-species transmission. Although SARS-CoV-2 exhibits overall strong CpG suppression, this varies considerably across the genome, and the Envelope (E) open reading frame (ORF) and ORF10 demonstrate an absence of CpG suppression. Across the Coronaviridae, E genes display remarkably high variation in CpG composition, with those of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 having much higher CpG content than other coronaviruses isolated from humans. This is an ancestrally derived trait reflecting their bat origins. Conservation of CpG motifs in these regions suggests that they have a functionality which over-rides the need to suppress CpG; an observation relevant to future strategies towards a rationally attenuated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Bioactive lipids with an array of known health-promoting properties can be suggested as effective agents in alleviating acute respiratory stress induced by virus. The bioactive lipid amide, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), due to several distinctive homeostatic properties, including anti-inflammatory activities, modulation of immune response, and anti-oxidant effects can be considered as a novel potential pharmacological alternative for the management of COVID-19.

Since its discovery, WNV has caused multiple human and animal disease outbreaks in all continents, except Antarctica. Infections are associated with economic losses, mainly due to the cost of treatment of infected patients, control programmes, and loss of animals and animal products. The pathogenesis of WNV has been extensively investigated in natural hosts as well as in several animal models, including rodents, lagomorphs, birds, and reptiles. However, most of the proposed pathogenesis hypotheses remain contentious, and much remains to be elucidated. At the same time, the unavailability of specific antiviral treatment or effective and safe vaccines contribute to the perpetuation of the disease and regular occurrence of outbreaks in both endemic and non-endemic areas. Moreover, globalisation and climate change are also important drivers of the emergence and re-emergence of the virus and disease. Here, we give an update of the pathobiology, epidemiology, diagnostics, control, and "One Health" implications of WNV infection and disease.																					WOS:000556425500001	32707644

Its high spread rate has turned it into public stigma. The current study is focusing on its treatment and control strategies on the basis of the facts and figs obtained from previous studies. Supplementation of infected person with minerals and vitamin would be very beneficial for faster recovery like in any other acute viral infection. Blood of a recovered person in any outbreak is very precious because it is containing high levels of neutralizing antibodies, memory T and B cells population. Both serum and buffy coat fractions of the blood will helpful for treatment as well as prophylaxis. The S proteins (spike) of SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV 1 have 70% similarity so the vaccine available for SARS would also be effective for COVID-19. Besides this, genome of SARS CoV 2 has been sequenced successfully and it is quite easy for the scientists to prepare DNA based vaccines and peptide based subunit vaccines targeting the S protein of the virus. To control the spread of COVID-19, various disinfectant and antiseptics are very useful. The virus is also susceptible to heat, low pH and UV light so hot climatic conditions are also lethal to this virus.																					WOS:000549423400036	33583808

Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis, discovering new drugs, and developing a vaccine. We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike and other genes among bat, pangolin, and human coronaviruses, suggesting similar evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2's entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species, together with frequent recombination among coronaviruses, suggests a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.

Novel hepaci- and pegi-like viruses in native Australian wildlife and non-human primates								VIRUS EVOLUTION				6	2					veaa064	10.1093/ve/veaa064				JUL 2020	2020	The Flaviviridae family of positive-sense RNA viruses contains important pathogens of humans and other animals, including Zika virus, dengue virus, and hepatitis C virus. The Flaviviridae are currently divided into four genera-Hepacivirus, Pegivirus, Pestivirus, and Flavivirus-each with a diverse host range. Members of the genus Hepacivirus are associated with an array of animal species, including humans, non-human primates, other mammalian species, as well as birds and fish, while the closely related pegiviruses have been identified in a variety of mammalian taxa, also including humans. Using a combination of total RNA and whole-genome sequencing we identified four novel hepaci-like viruses and one novel variant of a known hepacivirus in five species of Australian wildlife. The hosts infected comprised native Australian marsupials and birds, as well as a native gecko (Gehyra lauta). From these data we identified a distinct marsupial clade of hepaci-like viruses that also included an engorged Ixodes holocyclus tick collected while feeding on Australian long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta). Distinct lineages of hepaci-like viruses associated with geckos and birds were also identified. By mining the SRA database we similarly identified three new hepaci-like viruses from avian and primate hosts, as well as two novel pegi-like viruses associated with primates. The phylogenetic history of the hepaci-and pegi-like viruses as a whole, combined with co-phylogenetic analysis, provided support for virus-host co-divergence over the course of vertebrate evolution, although with frequent cross-species virus transmission. Overall, our work highlights the diversity of the Hepacivirus and Pegivirus genera as well as the uncertain phylogenetic distinction between.																					WOS:000610104700024	33240526

Repurposing Therapeutics for Potential Treatment of SARS-CoV-2: A Review								VIRUSES-BASEL				12	7					705	10.3390/v12070705				JUL 2020	2020	The need for proven disease-specific treatments for the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 necessitates a worldwide search for therapeutic options. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus shares extensive homology with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, effective therapies for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may also have therapeutic potential for the current COVID-19 outbreak. To identify therapeutics that might be repositioned for treatment of the SARS-CoV-2 disease COVID-19, we strategically reviewed the literature to identify existing therapeutics with evidence of efficacy for the treatment of the three coronaviruses that cause severe respiratory illness (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2). Mechanistic and in vitro analyses suggest multiple promising therapeutic options with potential for repurposing to treat patients with COVID-19. Therapeutics with particularly high potential efficacy for repurposing include camostat mesylate, remdesivir, favipiravir, tocilizumab, baricitinib, convalescent plasma, and humanized monoclonal antibodies. Camostat mesylate has shown therapeutic potential, likely by preventing viral entry into epithelial cells. In early research, the targeted antivirals remdesivir and favipiravir appear to benefit patients by decreasing viral replication; clinical trials suggest that remdesivir speeds recovery from COVID-19. Tocilizumab and baricitinib appear to improve mortality by preventing a severe cytokine storm. Convalescent plasma and humanized monoclonal antibodies offer passive immunity and decreased recovery time. This review highlights potential therapeutic options that may be repurposed to treat COVID-19 and suggests opportunities for further research.																					WOS:000554311800001	32629804

Equine pegiviruses cause persistent infection of bone marrow and are not associated with hepatitis								PLOS PATHOGENS				16	7					e1008677	10.1371/journal.ppat.1008677				JUL 2020	2020	Pegiviruses frequently cause persistent infection (as defined by >6 months), but unlike most other Flaviviridae members, no apparent clinical disease. Human pegivirus (HPgV, previously GBV-C) is detectable in 1-4% of healthy individuals and another 5-13% are seropositive. Some evidence for infection of bone marrow and spleen exists. Equine pegivirus 1 (EPgV-1) is not linked to disease, whereas another pegivirus, Theiler's disease-associated virus (TDAV), was identified in an outbreak of acute serum hepatitis (Theiler's disease) in horses. Although no subsequent reports link TDAV to disease, any association with hepatitis has not been formally examined. Here, we characterized EPgV-1 and TDAV tropism, sequence diversity, persistence and association with liver disease in horses. Among more than 20 tissue types, we consistently detected high viral loads only in serum, bone marrow and spleen, and viral RNA replication was consistently identified in bone marrow. PBMCs and lymph nodes, but not liver, were sporadically positive. To exclude potential effects of co-infecting agents in experimental infections, we constructed full-length consensus cDNA clones; this was enabled by determination of the complete viral genomes, including a novel TDAV 3' terminus. Clone derived RNA transcripts were used for direct intrasplenic inoculation of healthy horses. This led to productive infection detectable from week 2-3 and persisting beyond the 28 weeks of study. We did not observe any clinical signs of illness or elevation of circulating liver enzymes. The polyprotein consensus sequences did not change, suggesting that both clones were fully functional. To our knowledge, this is the first successful extrahepatic viral RNA launch and the first robust reverse genetics system for a pegivirus. In conclusion, equine pegiviruses are bone marrow tropic, cause persistent infection in horses, and are not associated with hepatitis. Based on these findings, it may be appropriate to rename the group of TDAV and related viruses as EPgV-2.Author summary Transmissible hepatitis in horses (Theiler's disease) has been known for 100 years without knowledge of causative infectious agents. Recently, two novel equine pegiviruses (EPgV) were discovered. Whereas EPgV-1 was not associated to disease, the other was identified in an outbreak of acute serum hepatitis and therefore named Theiler's disease-associated virus (TDAV). This finding was surprising since human and monkey pegiviruses typically cause long-term infection without associated clinical disease. Whereas no subsequent reports link TDAV to disease, the original association to hepatitis has not been formally examined. Here, we studied EPgV-1 and TDAV and found that their natural history of infection in horses were remarkably similar. Examination of various tissues identified the bone marrow as the primary site of replication for both viruses with no evidence of replication in the liver. To exclude potential effects of other infectious agents, we developed molecular full-length clones for EPgV-1 and TDAV and were able to initiate infection in horses using derived synthetic viral genetic material. This demonstrated long-term infection, but no association with hepatitis. These findings call into question the connection between TDAV, liver infection, and hepatitis in horses.

Zoonotic diseases are infections that are transmitted from animals to humans. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 most likely originated in bats and transmitted to humans through a possible intermediate host. Based on published research so far, pangolins are considered the most likely intermediate hosts. Further studies are needed on different wild animal species, including pangolins that are sold at the same wet market or similar wet markets before concluding pangolins as definitive intermediate hosts. SARS-CoV-2 is capable of reverse zoonosis as well. Additional research is needed to understand the pathogenicity of the virus, especially in companion animals, modes of transmission, incubation period, contagious period, and zoonotic potential. Interdisciplinary one health approach handles these mosaic issues of emerging threats by integrating professionals from multiple disciplines like human medicine, veterinary medicine, environmental health, and social sciences. Given that the future outbreak of zoonotic diseases is inevitable, importance must be given for swift identification of the pathogen, source, and transmission methods. Countries should invest in identifying the hot spots for the origin of zoonotic diseases, enhance diagnostic capabilities, and rapid containment measures at local, regional, and national levels. The threat posed by emerging infectious diseases in modern-days also needs combined efforts internationally where a single discipline or nation cannot handle the burden alone.

J	Malek Mahdavi, Aida								A brief review of interplay between vitamin D and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2: Implications for a potential treatment forCOVID-19								REVIEWS IN MEDICAL VIROLOGY				30	5						10.1002/rmv.2119		JUN 2020		SEP 2020	2020	The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly expanding and causing many deaths all over the world with the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring a pandemic in March 2020. Current therapeutic options are limited and there is no registered and/or definite treatment or vaccine for this disease or the causative infection, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), serves as the major entry point into cells for SARS-CoV-2 which attaches to human ACE2, thereby reducing the expression of ACE2 and causing lung injury and pneumonia. Vitamin D, a fat-soluble-vitamin, is a negative endocrine RAS modulator and inhibits renin expression and generation. It can induce ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/MasR axis activity and inhibits renin and the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis, thereby increasing expression and concentration of ACE2, MasR and Ang-(1-7) and having a potential protective role against acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, targeting the unbalanced RAS and ACE2 down-regulation with vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 infection is a potential therapeutic approach to combat COVID-19 and induced ARDS.

Citizens' juries give verdict on whether private practice veterinarians should attend unvaccinated Hendra virus suspect horses								AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL				98	7			273	279		10.1111/avj.12957		JUN 2020		JUL 2020	2020	Background Hendra virus (HeV) is endemic in Australian flying foxes, posing a threat to equine and human health. Equine vaccination remains the most effective risk mitigation strategy. Many horses remain unvaccinated - even in higher-risk regions. Debate surrounding the vaccine's use is characterised by conflicting perspectives, misunderstanding and mistrust. Private veterinary practitioners are critical to early identification of public health risk through recognition, sampling and management of suspect-equine-HeV-cases. However, managing such cases can be burdensome, with some veterinarians opting not to attend unvaccinated horses or to abandon equine practice because of risk posed by HeV disease and liability. Objective Ascertain the perspectives of informed citizens on what obligations (if any) private veterinarians have to attend unvaccinated horses with HeV or HeV-like disease. Methods Three citizens' juries were tasked with considering approaches to managing HeV risk in Australia, including (reported here) roles and obligations of private veterinarians in responding to HeV-suspect-cases. Results Jurors acknowledged that HeV management posed an important challenge for private veterinarians. A clear majority (27 of 31 jurors) voted that veterinarians should not be obliged to attend unvaccinated horses. All recognised that greater support for veterinarians should be a priority. Conclusions When informed of HeV risks and strategies for control and management, citizens appreciated the need to support veterinarians performing this critical 'One Health' role for public benefit. The current governance framework within which zoonotic disease recognition and response operates limits the contingency and scope for increasing support and efficacy of these important veterinary public health practices.

Bat-borne virus diversity, spillover and emergence								NATURE REVIEWS MICROBIOLOGY				18	8			461	471		10.1038/s41579-020-0394-z		JUN 2020		AUG 2020	2020	Most viral pathogens in humans have animal origins and arose through cross-species transmission. Over the past 50 years, several viruses, including Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2, have been linked back to various bat species. Despite decades of research into bats and the pathogens they carry, the fields of bat virus ecology and molecular biology are still nascent, with many questions largely unexplored, thus hindering our ability to anticipate and prepare for the next viral outbreak. In this Review, we discuss the latest advancements and understanding of bat-borne viruses, reflecting on current knowledge gaps and outlining the potential routes for future research as well as for outbreak response and prevention efforts.Bats harbour a large number of different viruses, some of which have spilled over to cause human disease. In this Review, Letko, Munster and colleagues discuss the diversity of bat viruses and the factors that determine the emergence of zoonotic viruses from bats.

For developing any preventive measure, an understanding of the zoonotic pattern for this virus is a necessity. We should have a clear knowledge of its reservoir host, its distribution pattern and spreading routes. Information about zoonotic reservoirs and its transmission among them can help to understand the COVID-19 outbreaks. In this article, we discuss about the bats as the zoonotic reservoir of several CoV strains, co-existence of bats and CoV/viruses, the sequence similarity of SARS-CoV-2 with bat SARS-like CoV, the probable source of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 strain and COVID-19 outbreak, intermediate host of CoVs and SARS-CoV-2, human to human transmission and the possibility to maintain the zoonotic barriers. Our knowledge about the zoonotic reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 and its transmission ability may help develop the preventive measures and control for the future outbreak of CoV.

To investigate the mechanisms that explain RVF recurrent circulation, we modelled a realistic epidemiological system at the pond level integrating vector population dynamics, resident and nomadic ruminant herd population dynamics, and nomadic herd movements recorded in Younoufere area. To calibrate the model, serological surveys were performed in 2015-2016 on both resident and nomadic domestic herds in the same area. Mosquito population dynamics were obtained from a published model trained in the same region. Model comparison techniques were used to compare five different scenarios of virus introduction by nomadic herds associated or not with vertical transmission in Aedes vexans. Our serological results confirmed a long lasting RVF endemicity in resident herds (IgG seroprevalence rate of 15.3%, n = 222), and provided the first estimation of RVF IgG seroprevalence in nomadic herds in West Africa (12.4%, n = 660). Multivariate analysis of serological data suggested an amplification of the transmission cycle during the rainy season with a peak of circulation at the end of that season. The best scenario of virus introduction combined yearly introductions of RVFV from 2008 to 2015 (the study period) by nomadic herds, with a proportion of viraemic individuals predicted to be larger in animals arriving during the 2nd half of the rainy season (3.4%). This result is coherent with the IgM prevalence rate (4%) found in nomadic herds sampled during the 2nd half of the rainy season. Although the existence of a vertical transmission mechanism in Aedes cannot be ruled out, our model demonstrates that nomadic movements are sufficient to account for this endemic circulation in northern Senegal.

While a specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual risk assessment and management strategies are crucial. The individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death. The careful individual assessment for the possible dietary, nutritional, medical, lifestyle, and environmental risks, together with the proper relevant risk management strategies, is the sensible way to deal with the pandemic of SARS-CoV-II.

Desiree								Rift Valley Fever: Important Considerations for Risk Mitigation and Future Outbreaks								TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE				5	2					89	10.3390/tropicalmed5020089				JUN 2020	2020	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic phlebovirus of the Phenuiviridae family with great opportunity for emergence in previously unaffected regions, despite its current geographical limits. Outbreaks of RVFV often infect humans or domesticated animals, such as livestock, concurrently and occur sporadically, ranging from localized outbreaks in villages to multi-country events that spread rapidly. The true burden of Rift Valley fever (RVF) is not well defined due to underreporting, misdiagnosis caused by the broad spectrum of disease presentation, and minimal access for rapid and accurate laboratory confirmation. Severe symptoms may include hemorrhagic fever, loss of vision, psychological impairment or disturbances, and organ failure. Those living in endemic areas and travelers should be aware of the potential for exposure to ongoing outbreaks or interepidemic transmission, and engage in behaviors to minimize exposure risks, as vaccinations in humans are currently unavailable and animal vaccinations are not used routinely or ubiquitously. The lack of vaccines approved for use in humans is concerning, as RVFV has proven to be highly pathogenic in naive populations, causing severe disease in a large percent of confirmed cases, which could have considerable impact on human health.

SI			128	136		10.1007/s13337-020-00575-1				JUN 2020	2020	Wuhan, the city in Hubei province in China is in the focus of global community due to the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), formerly known as 2019-nCoV. The virus emerged in humans from Wuhan seafood market probably via zoonotic transmission. Within a few days the virus spread its tentacles rapidly to neighboring cities in China and to different geographical regions through travelers and to some extent by human to human transmission leading to significant disease burden globally. More than 2,00,000 people (including more than 8000 deaths) have been infected with this respiratory illness across 167 countries and territories worldwide leading to a pandemic. The present review provides an outline about emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 from Wuhan, China in 2019-2020. We have also provided information about the classification, genome, proteins, clinical presentation of COVID-19, type of clinical specimens to be collected and diagnostic methods adopted to identify the respiratory illness. In addition we have also provided information about transmission dynamics, prevention measures and treatment options that are available at the present. Subsequently, we have given a comprehensive overview of the spread of this infection from China to the other parts of the globe. Management of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 encompassing surveillance, clinical, immunological, genetic and evolutionary investigations are likely to provide the desired results. Joint efforts of global scientific community are needed at this hour in terms of enhancement of research on development of accurate diagnostics, antiviral therapeutics and finally into formation of an effective vaccine against the emerging novel coronavirus.

COVID-19 Infection Diagnosis: Potential Impact of Isothermal Amplification Technology to Reduce Community Transmission of SARS-CoV-2								DIAGNOSTICS				10	6					399	10.3390/diagnostics10060399				JUN 2020	2020	The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is largely driven by community transmission, after 2019 novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV or SARS-CoV-2) crosses the borders. To stop the spread, rapid testing is required at community clinics and hospitals. These rapid tests should be comparable with the standard PCR technology. Isothermal amplification technology provides an excellent alternative that is highly amenable to resource limited settings, where expertise and infrastructure to support PCR are not available. In this review, we provide a brief description of isothermal amplification technology, its potential and the gaps that need to be considered for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Among this emerging technology, loop-mediated amplification (LAMP), recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and Nicking enzyme-assisted reaction (NEAR) technologies have been identified as potential platforms that could be implemented at community level, without samples referral to a centralized laboratory and prolonged turnaround time associated with the standard COVID-19 RT-PCR test. LAMP, for example, has recently been shown to be comparable with PCR and could be performed in less than 30 min by non-laboratory staff, without RNA extractions commonly associated with PCR. Interestingly, NEAR (ID NOW (TM) COVID-19 (Abbott, IL, USA) was able to detect the virus in 5 min. More so, isothermal platforms are cost effective and could easily be scaled up to resource limited settings. Diagnostics developers, scientific community and commercial companies could consider this alternative method to help stop the spread of COVID-19.																					WOS:000553880400001	32545412

Because there is no cure or treatment for this virus, it is emergingly urgent to find effective and validated methods to prevent and treat COVID-19 infection. In this context, alternatives related to nutritional therapy might help to control the infection. This narrative review proposes the importance and role of probiotics and diet as adjunct alternatives among the therapies available for the treatment of this new coronavirus. This review discusses the relationship between intestinal purine metabolism and the use ofLactobacillus gasseriand low-purine diets, particularly in individuals with hyperuricemia, as adjuvant nutritional therapies to improve the immune system and weaken viral replication, assisting in the treatment of COVID-19. These might be promising alternatives, in addition to many others that involve adequate intake of vitamins, minerals and bioactive compounds from food.

A mosquito-borne pathogen, RVFV is poised to move beyond the African continent and the Middle East and emerge in Europe and Asia. There is a risk that RVFV could also appear in the Americas, similar to the West Nile virus. In light of this potential threat, multiple studies have been undertaken to establish international surveillance programs and diagnostic tools, develop models of transmission dynamics and risk factors for infection, and to develop a variety of vaccines as countermeasures. Furthermore, considerable efforts to establish reliable challenge models of Rift Valley fever virus have been made and platforms for testing potential vaccines and therapeutics in target species have been established. This review emphasizes the progress and insights from a North American perspective to establish challenge models in target livestock such as cattle, sheep, and goats in comparisons to other researchers' reports. A brief summary of the potential role of wildlife, such as buffalo and white-tailed deer as reservoir species will also be discussed.																					WOS:000542539700001	32528981

Double-edged role of natural killer cells during RSV infection								INTERNATIONAL REVIEWS OF IMMUNOLOGY				39	5			233	244		10.1080/08830185.2020.1770748		MAY 2020		SEP 2 2020	2020	Natural killer cells play a vital role in the rejection of tumors and pathogen-infected cells. NK cells are indispensable in the early immune response against viral infections by directly targeting infected cells. Furthermore, NK cells influence adaptive immunity by driving virus-specific T-cell responses. Respiratory syncytial virus, a highly contagious virus that causes bronchiolitis, is the main reason for mortality in infants and elderly patients. RSV infection triggers both innate and adaptive immune responses. However, immunity against RSV is ephemeral due to the impaired development of immunological memory. The role of NK cells during RSV infection remains ambiguous. NK cells play a dual role in RSV infection; initially, their role is a protective one as they utilize their intrinsic cytotoxicity, followed by a detrimental one that induces lung injury due to the inhibition of antibody responses and the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors. Noteworthy, IFN-gamma released from NK cells play a critical role in promoting a shift to adaptive responses and inhibiting antibody responses in neonates. Indeed, NK cells have a pro-inflammatory and inhibitory role rather than a cytotoxic one that contributes to the severity of the disease. Therapeutic options, including DNA-protein-based vaccines, synthetic peptides, and attenuated strains, are presently under tests. However, there is a need for effective strategies to augment NK cell activity and circumvent the pro-inflammatory activity to benefit the host. In this review, we focused on the role played by NK cells in the immune response and its outcome on the immunopathogenesis of RSV disease.																					WOS:000541954900001	32983836

In North Africa, it causes human cases of meningoencephalitis with fatalities in Algeria and in Tunisia, whereas only horses were affected in Morocco. The aims of this study were to detect WNV in mosquitoes and to determine seroprevalence of WNV in Moroccan horses by the detection of IgG antibodies. A total of 1455 mosquitoes belonging to four different species were grouped by collection site, date, and sex with 10 specimens per pool and tested for 38 arboviruses using a high-throughput chip based on the BioMark Dynamic array system. Out of 146 mosquito pools tested, one pool was positive for WNV. This positive pool was confirmed by real time RT-PCR. The serosurvey showed that 33.7% (31/92) of horses were positive for competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) test. The flavivirus-sphere microsphere immnoassay (MIA) test, targeting three flaviviruses (WNV, Usutu virus (USUV) and Tick borne encephalitic virus (TBEV)) showed that 23 sera out of 31 were positive for WNV, two for USUV, two for USUV or WNV, and four for an undetermined flavivirus. Virus neutralization tests with USUV and WNV showed that 28 of 31 sera were positive for WNV and all sera were negative for USUV. This study reports, for the first time, the detection of WNV from Culex pipiens mosquitoes in Morocco and its circulation among horses. This highlights that the detection of arboviruses in mosquitoes could serve as an early warning signal of a viral activity to prevent future outbreaks in animals and humans.

The novel coronavirus (CoV) recognises, with high probability, a zoonotic origin but the role of animals in the SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology is still largely unknown. However, CoVs have been known in animals since several decades, so that veterinary coronavirologists have a great expertise on how to face CoV infections in animals, which could represent a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.In the present paper, we provide an up-to-date review of the literature currently available on animal CoVs, focusing on the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the emergence of novel CoV strains with different antigenic, biologic and/or pathogenetic features. A full comprehension of the mechanisms driving the evolution of animal CoVs will help better understand the emergence, spreading, and evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]. At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics.

The infection spread first in China and then in the rest of the world, and on the 11th of March, the WHO declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. Taking into consideration the mortality rate of COVID-19, about 5-7%, and the percentage of positive patients admitted to intensive care units being 9-11%, it should be mandatory to consider and take all necessary measures to contain the COVID-19 infection. Moreover, given the recent evidence in different hospitals suggesting IL-6 and TNF-alpha inhibitor drugs as a possible therapy for COVID-19, we aimed to highlight that a dietary intervention could be useful to prevent the infection and/or to ameliorate the outcomes during therapy. Considering that the COVID-19 infection can generate a mild or highly acute respiratory syndrome with a consequent release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 and TNF-alpha, a dietary regimen modification in order to improve the levels of adiponectin could be very useful both to prevent the infection and to take care of patients, improving their outcomes.

A Cross-Reactive Humanized Monoclonal Antibody Targeting Fusion Glycoprotein Function Protects Ferrets Against Lethal Nipah Virus and Hendra Virus Infection								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				221				S471	S479		10.1093/infdis/jiz515			4	MAY 1 2020	2020	Background. Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are zoonotic paramyxoviruses that cause severe disease in both animals and humans. There are no approved vaccines or treatments for use in humans; however, therapeutic treatment of both NiV and HeV infection in ferrets and non-human primates with a cross-reactive, neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (mAb), m102.4, targeting the G glycoprotein has been demonstrated. In a previous study, we isolated, characterized, and humanized a cross-reactive, neutralizing anti-F mAb (h5B3.1). The mAb h5B3.1 blocks the required F conformational change needed to facilitate membrane fusion and virus infection, and the epitope recognized by h5B3.1 has been structurally defined; however, the efficacy of h5B3.1 in vivo is unknown.Methods. The post-infection antiviral activity of h5B3.1 was evaluated in vivo by administration in ferrets after NiV and HeV virus challenge.Results. All subjects that received h5B3.1 from 1 to several days after infection with a high-dose, oral-nasal virus challenge were protected from disease, whereas all controls died.Conclusions. This is the first successful post-exposure antibody therapy for NiV and HeV using a humanized cross-reactive mAb targeting the F glycoprotein, and the findings suggest that a combination therapy targeting both F and G should be evaluated as a therapy for NiV/HeV infection.

Detection of Recombinant Rousettus Bat Coronavirus GCCDC1 in Lesser Dawn Bats (Eonycteris spelaea) in Singapore								VIRUSES-BASEL				12	5					539	10.3390/v12050539				MAY 2020	2020	Rousettus bat coronavirus GCCDC1 (RoBat-CoV GCCDC1) is a cross-family recombinant coronavirus that has previously only been reported in wild-caught bats in Yunnan, China. We report the persistence of a related strain in a captive colony of lesser dawn bats captured in Singapore. Genomic evidence of the virus was detected using targeted enrichment sequencing, and further investigated using deeper, unbiased high throughput sequencing. RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 Singapore shared 96.52% similarity with RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 356 (NC_030886) at the nucleotide level, and had a high prevalence in the captive bat colony. It was detected at five out of six sampling time points across the course of 18 months. A partial segment 1 from an ancestral Pteropine orthoreovirus, p10, makes up the recombinant portion of the virus, which shares high similarity with previously reported RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 strains that were detected in Yunnan, China. RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 is an intriguing, cross-family recombinant virus, with a geographical range that expands farther than was previously known. The discovery of RoBat-CoV GCCDC1 in Singapore indicates that this recombinant coronavirus exists in a broad geographical range, and can persist in bat colonies long-term.

J	Ploss, Alexander; Kapoor, Amit								Animal Models of Hepatitis C Virus Infection								COLD SPRING HARBOR PERSPECTIVES IN MEDICINE				10	5					a036970	10.1101/cshperspect.a036970				MAY 2020	2020	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an important and underreported infectious disease, causing chronic infection in similar to 71 million people worldwide. The limited host range of HCV, which robustly infects only humans and chimpanzees, has made studying this virus in vivo challenging and hampered the development of a desperately needed vaccine. The restrictions and ethical concerns surrounding biomedical research in chimpanzees has made the search for an animal model all the more important. In this review, we discuss different approaches that are being pursued toward creating small animal models for HCV infection. Although efforts to use a nonhuman primate species besides chimpanzees have proven challenging, important advances have been achieved in a variety of humanized mouse models. However, such models still fall short of the overarching goal to have an immunocompetent, inheritably susceptible in vivo platform in which the immunopathology of HCV could be studied and putative vaccines development. Alternatives to overcome this include virus adaptation, such as murine-tropic HCV strains, or the use of related hepaciviruses, of which many have been recently identified. Of the latter, the rodent/rat hepacivirus from Rattus norvegicus species-1 (RHV-rn1) holds promise as a surrogate virus in fully immunocompetent rats that can inform our understanding of the interaction between the immune response and viral outcomes (i.e., clearance vs. persistence). However, further characterization of these animal models is necessary before their use for gaining new insights into the immunopathogenesis of HCV and for conceptualizing HCV vaccines.

Resistance of Cynomolgus Monkeys to Nipah and Hendra Virus Disease Is Associated With Cell-Mediated and Humoral Immunity								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				221				S436	S447		10.1093/infdis/jiz613			4	MAY 1 2020	2020	Background. The henipaviruses, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV), are capable of causing severe and often lethal respiratory and/or neurologic disease in animals and humans. Given the sporadic nature of henipavirus outbreaks, licensure of vaccines and therapeutics for human use will likely require demonstration of efficacy in animal models that faithfully reproduce the human condition. Currently, the African green monkey (AGM) best mimics human henipavirus-induced disease.Methods. The pathogenic potential of HeV and both strains of NiV (Malaysia, Bangladesh) was assessed in cynomolgus monkeys and compared with henipavirus-infected historical control AGMs. Multiplex gene and protein expression assays were used to compare host responses.Results. In contrast to AGMs, in which henipaviruses cause severe and usually lethal disease, HeV and NiVs caused only mild or asymptomatic infections in macaques. All henipaviruses replicated in macaques with similar kinetics as in AGMs. Infection in macaques was associated with activation and predicted recruitment of cytotoxic CD8* T cells, Thi cells, IgM(+) B cells, and plasma cells. Conversely, fatal outcome in AGMs was associated with aberrant innate immune signaling, complement dysregulation, Th2 skewing, and increased secretion of MCP-1.Conclusion. The restriction factors identified in macaques can be harnessed for development of effective countermeasures against henipavirus disease.																					WOS:000553463400013	32022850

Infections in animal herds cause abortion storms, high mortality rates in neonates, and mild to severe symptoms. Infected animals can also transmit the virus to people, particularly people who live or work in close contact with livestock. There is currently an ongoing effort to produce safe and efficacious veterinary vaccines against RVFV in livestock to protect against both primary infection in animals and zoonotic infections in people. To test the efficacy of these vaccines it is essential to have a reliable challenge model in relevant target species, including ruminants. In this study we evaluated three routes of inoculation (intranasal, intradermal and a combination of routes) in Holstein cattle using an infectious dose of 10(7)pfu/ml and a virus strain from the 2006-2007 outbreak in Kenya and Sudan. Our results demonstrated that all routes of inoculation were effective at producing viremia in all animals; however, the intranasal route induced the highest levels and longest duration of viremia, the most noticeable clinical signs, and the most widespread infection of tissues. We therefore recommend using the intranasal inoculation for future vaccine and challenge studies.																					WOS:000556728700001	32411730

This review centers on a neonatal lamb model of RSV infection that has similarities to RSV infection of infants. It includes a comprehensive description of anatomical and immunological similarities between ovine and human lungs along with comparison of pulmonary changes and immune responses with RSV infection. These features make the newborn lamb an effective model for investigating key aspects of RSV infection in infants. The importance of RSV lamb model application in preclinical therapeutic trials and current updates on new studies with the RSV-infected neonatal lamb are also highlighted.

Horses can be involved in different sport disciplines, meat production, work and recreational purposes. Horses are also important for human health as they can be used as animal models for studying human diseases and in equine-assisted therapy. This review summarizes the data related to body fluids such as plasma/serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, saliva, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peritoneal fluid obtained using proteomic analysis. Horse body fluid proteome analysis under various physiological and pathological conditions is a useful method for identifying new biomarkers for horse diseases which are still difficult to diagnose, but with serious consequences on equine health and welfare. The findings reported here reveal that further proteomic studies on equine body fluids collected from diseased animals are required. Significance: Body fluids are sources of potential protein biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic target identification. Indeed, they contain proteins that play a crucial role in cell functions and whose presence or relative abundance are indicative of the health status of tissues/organs. The review reports the data on the equine body fluids obtained using proteomic analysis, including those which are commonly used to obtain a correct diagnosis and prognosis of horse diseases which still pose a significant challenge. For equine medicine, new biomarkers are needed to formulate early diagnosis and to distinguish among diseases with similar clinical signs.																					WOS:000551699500023	32569818

Of particular concern is the family of coronaviruses, which includes the causative agents of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and most recently, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), an epidemic of acute respiratory illness originating from Wuhan, China in December 2019. Viral detection, discovery, and surveillance activities were undertaken in Myanmar to identify viruses in animals at high risk contact interfaces with people. Free-ranging bats were captured, and rectal and oral swabs and guano samples collected for coronaviral screening using broadly reactive consensus conventional polymerase chain reaction. Sequences from positives were compared to known coronaviruses. Three novel alphacoronaviruses, three novel betacoronaviruses, and one known alphacoronavirus previously identified in other southeast Asian countries were detected for the first time in bats in Myanmar. Ongoing land use change remains a prominent driver of zoonotic disease emergence in Myanmar, bringing humans into ever closer contact with wildlife, and justifying continued surveillance and vigilance at broad scales.

Sero-Epidemiological Study of Selected Zoonotic and Abortifacient Pathogens in Cattle at a Wildlife-Livestock Interface in South Africa								VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES				20	4			258	267		10.1089/vbz.2019.2519				APR 1 2020	2020	A cross sectional sero-epidemiological study was conducted on cattle in a communal farming area adjacent to Kruger National Park at a wildlife-livestock interface in South Africa. A total of 184 cattle were screened for exposure to 5 abortifacient or zoonotic pathogens, namely Coxiella burnetii, Toxoplasma gondii, Chlamydophila abortus, Neospora caninum, and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. In addition, the virus neutralization test was used to confirm the presence of antibodies to RVFV. The seroprevalence of C. burnetii, T. gondii, C. abortus, N. caninum, and RVFV antibodies was 38.0%, 32.6%, 20.7%, 1.6%, and 0.5%, respectively, and varied between locations (p < 0.001). Seroprevalence of C. burnetii and T. gondii was highly clustered by location (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.57), and that of C. abortus moderately so (ICC = 0.11). Seroprevalence was not associated with sex or age for any pathogen, except for C. abortus, for which seroprevalence was positively associated with age (p = 0.01). The predominant mixed infections were C. burnetii and T. gondii (15.2%) and C. burnetii, T. gondii, and C. abortus (13.0%). The serological detection of the five abortifacient pathogens in cattle indicates the potential for economic losses to livestock farmers, health impacts to domestic animals, transmission across the livestock-wildlife interface, and the risk of zoonotic transmission. This is the first documentation of T. gondii infection in cattle in South Africa, while exposure to C. burnetii, C. abortus, and N. caninum infections is being reported for the first time in cattle in a wildlife-livestock interface in the country.

Virus-specific vaccines and antiviral drugs are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs, i.e. compounds targeting viruses belonging to two or more viral families) could provide additional protection of the general population from emerging and re-emerging viral diseases, reinforcing the arsenal of available antiviral options. Here, we review discovery and development of BSAAs and summarize the information on 120 safe-in-man agents in a freely accessible database (https://drugvirus.info/). Future and ongoing pre-clinical and clinical studies will increase the number of BSAAs, expand the spectrum of their indications, and identify drug combinations for treatment of emerging and re-emerging viral infections as well as co-infections.

Novel de Novo Genome of Cynopterus brachyotis Reveals Evolutionarily Abrupt Shifts in Gene Family Composition across Fruit Bats								GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				12	4			259	272		10.1093/gbe/evaa030				APR 2020	2020	Major novel physiological or phenotypic adaptations often require accompanying modifications at the genic level. Conversely, the detection of considerable contractions and/or expansions of gene families can be an indicator of fundamental but unrecognized physiological change. We sequenced a novel fruit bat genome (Cynopterus brachyotis) and adopted a comparative approach to reconstruct the evolutionof fruitbats, mappingcontractions andexpansionsofgene families along their evolutionary history. Despite a radical change in life history as compared with other bats (e.g., loss of echolocation, large size, and frugivory), fruit bats have undergone surprisingly limited change in their genic composition, perhaps apart from a potentially novel gene family expansion relating to telomere protection and longevity. In sharp contrast, within fruit bats, the new Cynopterus genome bears the signal of unusual gene loss and gene family contraction, despite its similarmorphology and lifestyle to two othermajor fruit bat lineages. Most missing genes are regulatory, immune-related, and olfactory in nature, illustrating the diversity of genomic strategies employed by bats to contend with responses to viral infection and olfactory requirements. Our results underscore that significant fluctuations in gene family composition are not always associated with obvious examples of novel physiological and phenotypic adaptations but may often relate to less-obvious shifts in immune strategies.

J	Earl, Patricia L.; Americo, Jeffrey L.; Moss, Bernard								Natural killer cells expanded in vivo or ex vivo with IL-15 overcomes the inherent susceptibility of CAST mice to lethal infection with orthopoxviruses								PLOS PATHOGENS				16	4					e1008505	10.1371/journal.ppat.1008505				APR 2020	2020	The wild-derived inbred CAST/EiJ mouse, one of eight founder strains in the Collaborative Cross panel, is an exceptional model for studying monkeypox virus (MPXV), an emerging human pathogen, and other orthopoxviruses including vaccinia virus (VACV). Previous studies suggested that the extreme susceptibility of the CAST mouse to orthopoxviruses is due to an insufficient innate immune response. Here, we focused on the low number of natural killer (NK) cells in the naive CAST mouse as a contributing factor to this condition. Administration of IL-15 to CAST mice transiently increased NK and CD8(+) T cells that could express IFN-gamma, indicating that the progenitor cells were capable of responding to cytokines. However, the number of NK cells rapidly declined indicating a defect in their homeostasis. Furthermore, IL-15-treated mice were protected from an otherwise lethal challenge with VACV or MPXV. IL-15 decreased virus spread and delayed death even when CD4(+)/CD8(+) T cells were depleted with antibody, supporting an early protective role of the expanded NK cells. Purified splenic NK cells from CAST mice proliferated in vitro in response to IL-15 and could be activated with IL-12/IL-18 to secrete interferon-gamma. Passive transfer of non-activated or activated CAST NK cells reduced VACV spread but only the latter completely prevented death at the virus dose used. Moreover, antibodies to interferon-gamma abrogated the protection by activated NK cells. Thus, the inherent susceptibility of CAST mice to orthopoxviruses can be explained by a low level of NK cells and this vulnerability can be overcome either by expanding their NK cells in vivo with IL-15 or by passive transfer of purified NK cells that were expanded and activated in vitro.Author summaryWith the eradication of smallpox, monkeypox virus (MPXV) remains the only poxvirus causing significant mortality in humans. Although endemic in parts of Africa, human infections have occurred in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel due to travelers or imported animals. Contrary to its name, MPXV primarily infects rodents and secondarily infects humans and other primates. The wild-derived CAST mouse is an excellent small animal model for studying the pathogenicity of MPXV and related orthopoxviruses including vaccinia virus (VACV) and for evaluating therapeutics. We previously found that the susceptibility of CAST mice is correlated with low numbers of natural killer (NK) cells and a delayed interferon-gamma response. Here we showed that in vivo administration of the cytokine IL-15 transiently raised NK cell numbers and protected CAST mice from systemic infections with VACV and MPXV. CAST mouse NK cells that were purified and expanded in vitro with IL-15 also provided protection, further demonstrating the important role of NK cells. The rapid decline in NK cell numbers following cessation of IL-15 administration or NK cell transfer suggests that a low level of NK cell homeostasis contributes to the susceptibility of CAST mice to virus infection.

Previous studies showed that SARS-CoV-2 is highly homologous to SARS-CoV and infects humans through the binding of the spike protein to ACE2. Here, we have systematically studied the molecular mechanisms of human infection with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV by protein-protein docking and MD simulations. It was found that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV, which may partly explain that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV. In addition, the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 has a significantly lower free energy than that of SARS-CoV, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 is more stable and may survive a higher temperature than SARS-CoV. This provides insights into the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 because SARS-like coronaviruses have originated in bats. Our computation also suggested that the RBD-ACE2 binding for SARS-CoV-2 is much more temperature-sensitive than that for SARS-CoV. Thus, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 would decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises. These findings would be beneficial for the disease prevention and drug/vaccine development of SARS-CoV-2.																					WOS:000539525300070	32290077

It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that is likely associated with zoonotic transmission. Based on the live data from live reference website Worldometer which provides counters and real-time statistics for diverse topics data, COVID-19 has influenced 186 nations. China reported 25% of cases, while 75% of the remaining cases were reported in other nations. The clinical and genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 support the similar pathogenesis pattern between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The elevated level of cytokine release during the infection caused the failure of multiple organs leading to the patient death. Treatment of patients depends on the clinical course and symptoms associated with the COVID-19. Several prevention and control measures including; active surveillance, use of masks, and hand sanitizers are recommended to stop the spread of this virus. Besides, COVID-19 was sampled using a throat swab to detect the viral nucleic acid using Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), for early detection and treatments evaluation. In this review, we comprehensively summarized the COVID-19 epidemiology, pathogenesis and diagnosis, using suitable literatures obtained from reliable sources.

In November 2018, RVF re-emerged in Mayotte (France) after 11 years. Up to the end of October 2019, 126 outbreaks in animals and 143 human cases were reported. RVF mortality was 0.01%, and the number of abortions reported in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive ruminants was fivefold greater than the previous 7 years. Milk loss production in 2019 compared to 2015-2018 was estimated to be 18%, corresponding to an economic loss of around Euro191,000 in all of Mayotte. The tropical climate in Mayotte provides conditions for the presence of mosquitoes during the whole year, and illegal introductions of animals represent a continuous risk of (re)introduction of RVF. The probability of RVF virus (RVFV) persisting in Mayotte for 5 or more years was estimated to be < 10% but could be much lower if vertical transmission in vectors does not occur. Persistence of RVF by vertical transmission in Mayotte and Reunion appears to be of minor relevance compared to other pathways of re-introduction (i.e. animal movement). However, there is a high uncertainty since there is limited information about the vertical transmission of some of the major species of vectors of RVFV in Mayotte and Reunion. The only identified pathways for the risk of spread of RVF from Mayotte to other countries were by infected vectors transported in airplanes or by wind currents. For the former, the risk of introduction of RVF to continental France was estimated to 4 x 10(-6) epidemic per year (median value; 95% CI: 2 x 10(-8); 0.0007), and 0.001 epidemic per year to Reunion (95% CI: 4 x 10(-6); 0.16). For the latter pathway, mosquitoes dispersing on the wind from Mayotte between January and April 2019 could have reached the Comoros Islands, Madagascar, Mozambique and, possibly, Tanzania. However, these countries are already endemic for RVF, and an incursion of RVFV-infected mosquitoes would have negligible impact. (c) 2020 European Food Safety Authority.

Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of a human monoclonal antibody targeting the G glycoprotein of henipaviruses in healthy adults: a first-in-human, randomised, controlled, phase 1 study								LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES				20	4			445	454		10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30634-6				APR 2020	2020	Background The monoclonal antibody m102.4 is a potent, fully human antibody that neutralises Hendra and Nipah viruses in vitro and in vivo. We aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of m102.4 in healthy adults.Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial of m102.4, we randomly assigned healthy adults aged 18-50 years with a body-mass index of 18.0-35.0 kg/m(2) to one of five cohorts. A sentinel pair for each cohort was randomly assigned to either m102.4 or placebo. The remaining participants in each cohort were randomly assigned (5:1) to receive m102.4 or placebo. Cohorts 1-4 received a single intravenous infusion of m102.4 at doses of 1 mg/kg (cohort 1), 3 mg/kg (cohort 2), 10 mg/kg (cohort 3), and 20 mg/kg (cohort 4), and were monitored for 113 days. Cohort 5 received two infusions of 20 mg/kg 72 h apart and were monitored for 123 days. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Analyses were completed according to protocol. The study was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000395538.Findings Between March 27, 2015, and June 16, 2016, 40 (52%) of 77 healthy screened adults were enrolled in the study. Eight participants were assigned to each cohort (six received m102.4 and two received placebo). 86 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, with similar rates between placebo and treatment groups. The most common treatment-related event was headache (12 [40%] of 30 participants in the combined m102.4 group, and three [30%] of ten participants in the pooled placebo group). No deaths or severe adverse events leading to study discontinuation occurred. Pharmacoldnetics based on those receiving m102.4 (n=30) were linear, with a median half-life of 663.3 h (range 474.3-735.1) for cohort 1, 466.3 h (382.8-522.3) for cohort 2, 397.0 h (333. 9-491- 8) for cohort 3, and 466 . 7 h (351.0-889.6) for cohort 4. The elimination kinetics of those receiving repeated dosing (cohort 5) were similar to those of single-dose recipients (median elimination half-time 472.0 [385.6-592.0]). Anti-m102.4 antibodies were not detected at any time-point during the study.Interpretation Single and repeated dosing of m102.4 were well tolerated and safe, displayed linear pharmacokinetics, and showed no evidence of an immunogenic response. This study will inform future dosing regimens for m102.4 to achieve prolonged exposure for systemic efficacy to prevent and treat henipavirus infections. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Priorities for developing respiratory syncytial virus vaccines in different target populations								SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				12	535					eaax2466	10.1126/scitranslmed.aax2466				MAR 18 2020	2020	The development of an effective vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has been hampered by major difficulties that occurred in the 1960s when a formalin-inactivated vaccine led to increased severity of RSV disease after acquisition of the virus in the RSV season after vaccination. Recent renewed efforts to develop a vaccine have resulted in about 38 candidate vaccines and monoclonal antibodies now in clinical development. The target populations for effective vaccination are varied and include neonates, young children, pregnant women, and older adults. The reasons for susceptibility to infection in each of these groups may be different and, therefore, could require different vaccine types for induction of protective immune responses, adding a further challenge for vaccine development. Here, we review the current knowledge of RSV vaccine development for these target populations and propose a view and rationale for prioritizing RSV vaccine development.

On 30 January 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared the COVID-19 epidemic as a public health emergency of international concern. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, since the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, marked the third introduction of a highly pathogenic and large-scale epidemic coronavirus into the human population in the twenty-first century. As of 1 March 2020, a total of 87,137 confirmed cases globally, 79,968 confirmed in China and 7169 outside of China, with 2977 deaths (3.4%) had been reported by WHO. Meanwhile, several independent research groups have identified that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to beta-coronavirus, with highly identical genome to bat coronavirus, pointing to bat as the natural host. The novel coronavirus uses the same receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as that for SARS-CoV, and mainly spreads through the respiratory tract. Importantly, increasingly evidence showed sustained human-to-human transmission, along with many exported cases across the globe. The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, fatigue and a small population of patients appeared gastrointestinal infection symptoms. The elderly and people with underlying diseases are susceptible to infection and prone to serious outcomes, which may be associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and cytokine storm. Currently, there are few specific antiviral strategies, but several potent candidates of antivirals and repurposed drugs are under urgent investigation. In this review, we summarized the latest research progress of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, and discussed the current treatment and scientific advancements to combat the epidemic novel coronavirus.

Other members of the housing group had mild respiratory signs. Gross examination revealed bilateral pulmonary congestion and froth in the bronchi. Microscopically, the lungs had lymphocytic, neutrophilic infiltration of the interstitium and alveolar walls. There was necrosis of terminal bronchiolar epithelium and terminal bronchioles, and surrounding alveoli contained necrotic and exfoliated epithelial cells admixed with histiocytes and syncytial cells. Additional lesions included nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, and epidermal hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia with syncytial cell formation. PCR screening for 12 human respiratory viruses was positive for orthopneumovirus in multiple tissues, including lung, and immunohistochemical staining for human orthopneumovirus detected viral antigen within bronchial epithelial cells. IHC and PCR for measles virus on preserved sections were negative. White-handed gibbons have not been previously reported as hosts for human orthopneumovirus, an important respiratory pathogen of both primates and humans.

An Evolutionary Insertion in the Mxra8 Receptor-Binding Site Confers Resistance to Alphavirus Infection and Pathogenesis								CELL HOST & MICROBE				27	3			428	+		10.1016/j.chom.2020.01.008				MAR 11 2020	2020	Alphaviruses are emerging, mosquito-transmitted RNA viruses with poorly understood cellular tropism and species selectivity. Mxra8 is a receptor for multiple alphaviruses including chikungunya virus (CHIKV). We discovered that while expression of mouse, rat, chimpanzee, dog, horse, goat, sheep, and human Mxra8 enables alphavirus infection in cell culture, cattle Mxra8 does not. Cattle Mxra8 encodes a 15-amino acid insertion in its ectodomain that prevents Mxra8 binding to CHIKV. Identical insertions are present in zebu, yak, and the extinct auroch. As other Bovinae lineages contain related Mxra8 sequences, this insertion likely occurred at least 5 million years ago. Removing the Mxra8 insertion in Bovinae enhances alphavirus binding and infection, while introducing the insertion into mouse Mxra8 blocks CHIKV binding, prevents infection by multiple alphaviruses in cells, and mitigates CHIKV-induced pathogenesis in mice. Our studies on how this insertion provides resistance to CHIKV infection could facilitate countermeasures that disrupt Mxra8 interactions with alphaviruses.

In the absence of treatment for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here, we have conducted an online search for all treatment options related to coronavirus infections as well as some RNA-virus infection and we have found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest that the nutritional status of each infected patient should be evaluated before the administration of general treatments and the current children's RNA-virus vaccines including influenza vaccine should be immunized for uninfected people and health care workers. In addition, convalescent plasma should be given to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest that all the potential interventions be implemented to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.																					WOS:000517680100001	32052466

Given public health interventions that focus solely on disease prevention in humans have no effect on the reduction of infection in the reservoir hosts, themost effective way to combat human rabies infection is to control thedisease transmission by mass vaccination of the animal source, e.g. dogs and wildlife1.

Clinical Presentation and Serologic Response during a Rabies Epizootic in Captive Common Vampire Bats (Desmodus rotundus)								TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE				5	1						10.3390/tropicalmed5010034				MAR 2020	2020	We report mortality events in a group of 123 common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) captured in Mexico and housed for a rabies vaccine efficacy study in Madison, Wisconsin. Bat mortalities occurred in Mexico and Wisconsin, but rabies cases reported herein are only those that occurred after arrival in Madison (n = 15). Bats were confirmed positive for rabies virus (RABV) by the direct fluorescent antibody test. In accordance with previous reports, we observed long incubation periods (more than 100 days), variability in clinical signs prior to death, excretion of virus in saliva, and changes in rabies neutralizing antibody (rVNA) titers post-infection. We observed that the furious form of rabies (aggression, hyper-salivation, and hyper-excitability) manifested in three bats, which has not been reported in vampire bat studies since 1936. RABV was detected in saliva of 5/9 bats, 2-5 days prior to death, but was not detected in four of those bats that had been vaccinated shortly after exposure. Bats from different capture sites were involved in two separate outbreaks, and phylogenetic analysis revealed differences in the glycoprotein gene sequences of RABV isolated from each event, indicating that two different lineages were circulating separately during capture at each site.

NS4/5 mutations enhance flavivirus Bamaga virus infectivity and pathogenicity in vitro and in vivo								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				14	3					e0008166	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008166				MAR 2020	2020	Author summaryMosquito-borne pathogens include flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus, dengue virus and Zika virus, which continue to cause disease worldwide. Some of these flaviviruses have only recently emerged as major human pathogens, despite having been discovered decades ago. Determining the mechanisms of host-restriction of viruses with cryptic ecological niches will help us to understand how new viral diseases may emerge. In this study, we investigated the host-restriction of a recently discovered flavivirus, Bamaga virus. We demonstrated that the virus host-restriction observed in vertebrate cells only occurs at 37 degrees C, and that the virus can replicate efficiently at lower temperatures. We identified three amino acid substitutions located at two viral protease cleavage sites, which we have demonstrated are directly involved in BgV host-restriction in vitro and attenuation in vivo. Overall, our data provide new insight into mechanisms flavivirus attenuation and host-restriction in vertebrates.Flaviviruses such as yellow fever, dengue or Zika viruses are responsible for significant human and veterinary diseases worldwide. These viruses contain an RNA genome, prone to mutations, which enhances their potential to emerge as pathogens. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the yellow fever virus group that we have previously shown to be host-restricted in vertebrates and horizontally transmissible by Culex mosquitoes. Here, we aimed to characterise BgV host-restriction and to investigate the mechanisms involved. We showed that BgV could not replicate in a wide range of vertebrate cell lines and animal species. We determined that the mechanisms involved in BgV host-restriction were independent of the type-1 interferon response and RNAse L activity. Using a BgV infectious clone and two chimeric viruses generated as hybrids between BgV and West Nile virus, we demonstrated that BgV host-restriction occurred post-cell entry. Notably, BgV host-restriction was shown to be temperature-dependent, as BgV replicated in all vertebrate cell lines at 34 degrees C but only in a subset at 37 degrees C. Serial passaging of BgV in Vero cells resulted in adaptive mutants capable of efficient replication at 37 degrees C. The identified mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions in NS4A-S124F, NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C, all occurring close to a viral protease cleavage site (NS4A/2K and NS4B/NS5). These mutations were reverse engineered into infectious clones of BgV, which revealed that NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C were sufficient to restore BgV replication in vertebrate cells at 37 degrees C, while NS4A-S124F further increased replication efficiency. When these mutant viruses were injected into immunocompetent mice, alongside BgV and West Nile virus chimeras, infection and neurovirulence were enhanced as determined by clinical scores, seroconversion, micro-neutralisation, viremia, histopathology and immunohistochemistry, confirming the involvement of these residues in the attenuation of BgV. Our studies identify a new mechanism of host-restriction and attenuation of a mosquito-borne flavivirus.																					WOS:000528655400084	32203536

After about 10 years, in 2012, another similar coronavirus triggered the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. Both caused severe pneumonia killing 774 and 858 people with 8700 cases of confirmed infection for the former, and 2494 for the latter, causing significant economic losses. 8 years later, despite the MERS outbreak remaining in certain parts of the world, at the end of 2019, a new zoonotic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and responsible of coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), arose from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It spread rapidly and to date has killed 3,242 persons with more than 81,000 cases of infection in China and causing over 126,000 global cases and 5,414 deaths in 166 other countries around the world, especially Italy. SARS-CoV-2 would seem to have come from a bat, but the intermediate reservoir continues to be unknown. Nonetheless, as for SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, the Spillover effect linked to animal-human promiscuity, human activities including deforestation, illegal bush-trafficking and bushmeat, cannot be excluded. Recently, however, evidence of inter-human only transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been accumulated and thus, the outbreak seems to be spreading by human-to-human transmission throughout a large part of the world. Herein we will provide with an update on the main features of COVID-19 and suggest possible solutions how to halt the expansion of this novel pandemic.

Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are mainly known to cause infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract but the symptoms may also involve the nervous and digestive systems. Since the beginning of December 2019, there has been an epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, which was originally referred to as 2019-nCoV. The most common symptoms are fever and cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnea, myalgia, arthralgia or sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea (30%). The best prevention is to avoid exposure. In addition, contact persons should be subjected to mandatory quarantine. COVID-19 patients should be treated in specialist centers. A significant number of patients with pneumonia require passive oxygen therapy. Non-invasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen therapy can be applied in mild and moderate non-hypercapnia cases. A lung-saving ventilation strategy must be implemented in acute respiratory distress syndrome and mechanically ventilated patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is a highly specialized method, available only in selected centers and not applicable to a significant number of cases. Specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 is not currently available. Modern medicine is gearing up to fight the new coronavirus pandemic. The key is a holistic approach to the patient including, primarily, the use of personal protective equipment to reduce the risk of further virus transmission, as well as patient management, which consists in both quarantine and, in the absence of specific pharmacological therapy, symptomatic treatment.

Remotely Sensed Imagery for Early Detection of Respiratory Disease in Pigs: A Pilot Study								ANIMALS				10	3					451	10.3390/ani10030451				MAR 2020	2020	Simple Summary Respiratory disease in pigs causes suffering in infected animals and economic losses to producers. One of the most appropriate approaches to minimising these negative effects is by the early detection of infected animals. This pilot study aimed to use computer-based techniques to measure changes in temperature (eye and ear-base temperature), heart rate and respiration rate of pigs from thermal-infrared and conventional images. These measures, together with clinical observations, were obtained from pigs that were infected with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (APP) and from pigs that were healthy. Infected pigs showed higher temperature and heart rate than healthy pigs across the period analysed. Respiration rate showed less difference between infected and healthy pigs. In addition, the biggest changes in these measures were recorded from six hours before the clinical observations identified sick animals. Results have highlighted that computer vision techniques can provide important and useable data regarding physiological changes that can indicate early signs of respiratory infection in pigs. This could aid the management of the disease, increasing the success of the treatment and decreasing the rate of severe cases and death.Abstract Respiratory diseases are a major problem in the pig industry worldwide. Due to the impact of these diseases, the early identification of infected herds is essential. Computer vision technology, using RGB (red, green and blue) and thermal infrared imagery, can assist the early detection of changes in animal physiology related to these and other diseases. This pilot study aimed to identify whether these techniques are a useful tool to detect early changes of eye and ear-base temperature, heart rate and respiration rate in pigs that were challenged with Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Clinical observations and imagery were analysed, comparing data obtained from animals that showed some signs of illness with data from animals that showed no signs of ill health. Highly significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between sick and healthy pigs in heart rate, eye and ear temperature, with higher heart rate and higher temperatures in sick pigs. The largest change in temperature and heart rate remotely measured was observed around 4-6 h before signs of clinical illness were observed by the skilled technicians. These data suggest that computer vision techniques could be a useful tool to detect indicators of disease before the symptoms can be observed by stock people, assisting the early detection and control of respiratory diseases in pigs, promoting further research to study the capability and possible uses of this technology for on farm monitoring and management.

Structural, glycosylation and antigenic variation between 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)								VirusDisease				31	1						10.1007/s13337-020-00571-5				MAR 2020	2020	The emergence of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is of global concern and might have emerged from RNA recombination among existing coronaviruses. CoV spike (S) protein which is crucial for receptor binding, membrane fusion via conformational changes, internalization of the virus, host tissue tropism and comprises crucial targets for vaccine development, remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, the present study has been planned to determine the sequence variation, structural and antigenic divergence of S glycoprotein which may be helpful for the management of 2019-nCoV infection. The sequences of spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) were used for the comparison. The sequence variations were determined using EMBOSS Needle pairwise sequence alignment tools. The variation in glycosylation sites was predicted by NetNGlyc 1.0 and validated by N-GlyDE server. Antigenicity was predicted by NetCTL 1.2 and validated by IEDB Analysis Resource server. The structural divergence was determined by using SuperPose Version 1.0 based on cryo-EM structure of the SARS coronavirus spike glycoprotein. Our data suggests that 2019-nCoV is newly spilled coronavirus into humans in China is closely related to SARS-CoV, which has only 12.8% of difference with SARS-CoV in S protein and has 83.9% similarity in minimal receptor-binding domain with SARS-CoV. Addition of a novel glycosylation sites were observed in 2019-nCoV. In addition, antigenic analysis proposes that great antigenic differences exist between both the viral strains, but some of the epitopes were found to be similar between both the S proteins. In spite of the variation in S protein amino acid composition, we found no significant difference in their structures. Collectively, for the first time our results exhibit the emergence of human 2019-nCoV is closely related to predecessor SARS-CoV and provide the evidence that 2019-nCoV uses various novel glycosylation sites as SARS-CoV and may have a potential to become pandemic owing its antigenic discrepancy. Further, demonstration of novel Cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes may impart opportunities for the development of peptide based vaccine for the prevention of 2019-nCoV.

Although the positive rate of HPgV-2 antibodies in HIV/HCV-coinfected individuals (27.69%) was significantly higher than that of HIV monoinfections (20.82%) (p = 0.036), this is the first report of HPgV-2 viremia in HIV-infected individuals without HCV infection and the presence of two HPgV-2 lineages in China. Our data indicate that HPgV-2 can also be transmitted sexually, which might be facilitated when combined with HCV infection, injecting drug use, and risky sexual behavior, which appear to have a synergistic effect on HPgV-2 infection. Phylogenetic analysis of 26 near-full-length genome sequences showed that the HPgV-2 strains in China are divided into two clusters.																					WOS:000513451500007	31965315

Potent in vitro activity of beta-D-4 '-chloromethyl-2 '-deoxy-2 '-fluorocytidine against Nipah virus								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				175						104712	10.1016/j.antiviral.2020.104712				MAR 2020	2020	Nipah virus (NiV) is a highly pathogenic zoonotic paramyxovirus that continues to cause outbreaks in humans characterized by high mortality and significant clinical sequelae in survivors. Currently, no therapeutics are approved for use in humans against NiV infection. Here, we report that 4'-chloromethyl-2'-deoxy-2'-fluorocytidine (ALS-8112) inhibits NiV. ALS-8112 is the parent nucleoside of lumicitabine, which has been evaluated in phase I and II clinical trials to treat pediatric and adult respiratory syncytial virus infection. In this study, we tested ALS-8112 against NiV and other major human respiratory pneumo- and paramyxoviruses in 2 human lung epithelial cell lines, and demonstrated the ability of ALS-8112 to reduce infectious wild-type NiV yield by over 6 orders of magnitude with no apparent cytotoxicity. However, further cytotoxicity testing in primary cells and bone marrow progenitor cells indicated cytotoxicity at higher concentrations of ALS-8112. Our results warrant the evaluation of lumicitabine against NiV infection in relevant animal models.																					WOS:000523597100009	31935422

Rift Valley fever is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and in the Arabian Peninsula, with periodic epidemics characterised by 5-15 years of inter-epizootic periods. In the last two decades, RVF was notified in new African regions (e.g. Sahel), RVF epidemics occurred more frequently and low-level enzootic virus circulation has been demonstrated in livestock in various areas. Recent outbreaks in a French overseas department and some seropositive cases detected in Turkey, Tunisia and Libya raised the attention of the EU for a possible incursion into neighbouring countries. The movement of live animals is the most important pathway for RVF spread from the African endemic areas to North Africa and the Middle East. The movement of infected animals and infected vectors when shipped by flights, containers or road transport is considered as other plausible pathways of introduction into Europe. The overall risk of introduction of RVF into EU through the movement of infected animals is very low in all the EU regions and in all MSs (less than one epidemic every 500 years), given the strict EU animal import policy. The same level of risk of introduction in all the EU regions was estimated also considering the movement of infected vectors, with the highest level for Belgium, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands (one epidemic every 228-700 years), mainly linked to the number of connections by air and sea transports with African RVF infected countries. Although the EU territory does not seem to be directly exposed to an imminent risk of RVFV introduction, the risk of further spread into countries neighbouring the EU and the risks of possible introduction of infected vectors, suggest that EU authorities need to strengthen their surveillance and response capacities, as well as the collaboration with North African and Middle Eastern countries.

All sera that had cELISA anti-Flavivirus antibodies were further examined by the VNT. Thirteen wild boars (7.73%) were positive for Flavivirus by cELISA, a single European wild boar serum was positive for VNT, with a neutralizing antibody titer 1/14. No samples resulted positive for Flavivirus by RT-PCR assay.Abstract Background: A retrospective sero-survey for evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in European wild boar (Sus scorfa) was conducted in the Latium region, Italy, on stored serum samples of the period November 2011 to January 2012. Methods: Sera were collected from 168 European wild boars and screened for antibodies to WNV and other Flaviviruses by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). All sera positive for Flavivirus antibodies by cELISA were further examined by virus neutralization test (VNT). To test the presence of Flavivirus RNA in samples, an RT-PCR was performed using a pan-Flavivirus primers pair. Results: Thirteen wild boars (7.73%) were seropositive for Flaviviruses. The hemolysis of serum samples limited the interpretation of the VNT for 7 samples, confirming the presence of specific antibody against WNV in a single European wild boar serum sample. The presence of ELISA positive/VNT negative samples suggests the occurrence of non-neutralizing antibodies against WNV or other antigen-related Flaviviruses. No samples resulted positive for Flavivirus by RT-PCR assay. Conclusion: Although a moderately high percentage of animals with specific antibody for WNV has been detected in wild boar in other surveillance studies in Europe, this has not been reported previously in Italy. Together, these data indicate that European wild boar are exposed to WNV and/or other related-Flavivirus in central Italy and confirm the usefulness of wild ungulates, as suitable Flavivirus sentinels.

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21" century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.

Most paramyxoviruses enter epithelial cells of the airway using sialic acid as a receptor and cause only mild disease. However, others cross the epithelial barrier and cause more severe disease. For some of these viruses, the host receptors have been identified, and the mechanisms of cell entry have been elucidated. The tetrameric attachment proteins of paramyxoviruses have vastly different binding affinities for their cognate receptors, which they contact through different binding surfaces. Nevertheless, all input signals are converted to the same output: conformational changes that trigger refolding of trimeric fusion proteins and membrane fusion. Experiments with selectively receptor-blinded viruses inoculated into their natural hosts have provided insights into tropism, identifying the cells and tissues that support growth and revealing the mechanisms of pathogenesis. These analyses also shed light on diabolically elegant mechanisms used by morbilliviruses, including the measles virus, to promote massive amplification within the host, followed by efficient aerosolization and rapid spread through host populations. In another paradigm of receptor-facilitated severe disease, henipaviruses, including Nipah and Hendra viruses, use different members of one protein family to cause zoonoses. Specific properties of different paramyxoviruses, like neurotoxicity and immunosuppression, are now understood in the light of receptor specificity. We propose that research on the specific receptors for several newly identified members of the Paramyxoviridae family that may not bind sialic acid is needed to anticipate their zoonotic potential and to generate effective vaccines and antiviral compounds.

It causes various diseases such as respiratory ailments and encephalitis and poses a great threat to humans and livestock. Despite various efforts, there is no approved antiviral treatment available. Therefore, to expedite and assist the research, we have developed an integrative resource NipahVR (http://bioinfo.imtech.res.in/manojk/nipahvr/) for the multi-targeted putative therapeutics and epitopes for NiV. It is structured into different sections, i.e. genomes, codon usage, phylogenomics, molecular diagnostic primers, therapeutics (siRNAs, sgRNAs, miRNAs) and vaccine epitopes (Bcell, CTL, MHC-I and -II binders). Most decisively, potentially efficient therapeutic regimens targeting different NiV proteins and genes were anticipated and projected. We hope this computational resource would be helpful in developing combating strategies against this deadly pathogen.

One challenge in preventing monkeypox is a lack of knowledge, particularly among healthcare workers. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge of monkeypox among general practitioners (GPs) in Indonesia. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. The survey collected participants' knowledge on a 21-item scale and explanatory variables. A two-step logistic regression analysis was employed to assess the predictors of knowledge of monkeypox. A total of 432 GPs were included; 10.0% and 36.5% of them had a good knowledge using an 80% and 70% cutoff point for knowledge domain, respectively. No explanatory variables were associated with knowledge when using 80% cutoff point. Using the lower cutoff, there was lower knowledge among GPs who graduated from universities located in Sumatra or other islands versus Java (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.53; 95%CI: 0.28-0.97, p = 0.041) and among those were older than 30 years compared to younger GPs (aOR: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.39-0.96, p = 0.033). GPs working in private clinics had less knowledge compared to GPs in community health centers (aOR: 0.55; 95%CI: 0.31-0.99, p = 0.047). In conclusion, knowledge of monkeypox among GPs in Indonesia is relatively low in all groups. Increasing knowledge of monkeypox will be key to improving the capacity of GPs to respond to human monkeypox cases and to report into a disease surveillance system.

The inoculated animals did not develop any clinical signs of disease nor evidence of Zika virus replication in peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid and tissues including brain and spinal cord assessed by real-time RT-PCR. Sera were also negative for Zika virus antibodies by Zika virus neutralization assays as well as Zika virus immunoperoxidase staining of Zika infected Vero cells. Chicken embryos were inoculated by different routes including yolk sac (4 day old embryos), chorioallantoic membrane (8 day old embryos), amniotic fluid (8 day old embryos) and intravenous routes (12 day old embryos). Virus replication in chicken embryos was observed in the brain and body tissues following intravenous (IV), yolk sac (YS), chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and amniotic fluid (AF) inoculation routes. The highest mortality was observed in embryos inoculated via yolk sac. The dead embryos showed diffuse muscular hemorrhages. The yolk sac inoculated chicken embryos showed delayed hatching and displayed neurological signs immediately after hatching. These studies demonstrate that 8 week old sheep, 6 month old cattle, 4 week old pigs, and 4 week old chickens are not susceptible to Zika virus infection when inoculated experimentally and therefore unlikely to pose a risk as Zika virus reservoirs. However, chicken embryos are highly susceptible to Zika virus resulting in clinical disease of chicks after hatching. This study demonstrates that Zika virus has a tropism for embryonic tissue and that chicken embryos can be used as a model to study Zika virus replication and pathogenesis.

Here, we present a report dedicated to entomological aspects of CHIKV, ONNV and MAYV. Recent global expansion of chikungunya virus has been possible because CHIKV established a transmission cycle in urban settings using anthropophilic vectors such as Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti. MAYV and ONNV have a more limited geographic distribution, being confined to Africa (ONNV) and central-southern America (MAYV). ONNV is probably maintained through an enzootic cycle that has not been characterized yet, with Anopheles species as main vectors and humans as amplification hosts during epidemics. MAYV is transmitted by Haemagogus species in an enzootic cycle using non-human primates as the main amplification and maintenance hosts, and humans becoming sporadically infected when venturing in or nearby forest habitats. Here, we focused on the transmission cycle and natural vectors that sustain circulation of these viruses in their respective locations. The knowledge of the natural ecology of transmission and the capacity of different vectors to transmit these viruses is crucial to understand CHIKV emergence, and to assess the risk that MAYV and ONNV will expand on wide scale using anthropophilic mosquito species not normally considered primary vectors. Finally, the experts identified knowledge gaps and provided adapted recommendations, in order to address future entomological investigations in the right direction.

Mechanisms of inter-epidemic maintenance of Rift Valley fever phlebovirus								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				174						104692	10.1016/j.antiviral.2019.104692				FEB 2020	2020	Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that has caused substantial epidemics throughout Africa and in the Arabian Peninsula. The virus can cause severe disease in livestock and humans and therefore the control and prevention of viral outbreaks is of utmost importance. The epidemiology of RVFV has some particular characteristics. Unexpected and significant epidemics have been observed in spatially and temporally divergent patterns across the African continent. Sudden epidemics in previously unaffected areas are followed by periods of long-term apparent absence of virus and sudden, unpredictable reoccurrence in disparate regions. Therefore, the elucidation of underlying mechanisms of viral maintenance is one of the largest gaps in the knowledge of RVFV ecology. It remains unknown whether the virus needs to be reintroduced before RVF outbreaks can occur, or if unperceived viral circulation in local vertebrates or mosquitoes is sufficient for maintenance of the virus. To gain insight into these knowledge gaps, we here review existing data that describe potential mechanisms of RVFV maintenance, as well as molecular and serological studies in endemic and nonendemic areas that provide evidence of an inter- or pre-epidemic virus presence. Basic and country-specific mechanisms of RVFV introduction into non-endemic countries are summarized and an overview of studies using mathematical modeling of RVFV persistence is given.

Detection of coronaviruses in Pteropus Rousettus species of bats from different States of India								INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH				151	2-3			226	235		10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_795_20				FEB-MAR 2020	2020	Background objectives: Bats are considered to be the natural reservoir for many viruses, of which some are potential human pathogens. In India, an association of Pteropus medius bats with the Nipah virus was reported in the past. It is suspected that the recently emerged severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also has its association with bats. To assess the presence of CoVs in bats, we performed identification and characterization of bat CoV (BtCoV) in P. medius and Rousettus species from representative States in India, collected during 2018 and 2019. Methods: Representative rectal swab (RS) and throat swab specimens of Pteropus and Rousettus spp. bats were screened for CoVs using a pan-CoV reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene. A single-step RT-PCR was performed on the RNA extracted from the bat specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed on a few representative bat specimens that were tested positive. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on the partial sequences of RdRp gene sequences retrieved from both the bat species and complete viral genomes recovered from Rousettus spp. Results: Bat samples from the seven States were screened, and the RS specimens of eight Rousettus spp. and 21 Pteropus spp. were found positive for CoV RdRp gene. Among these, by Sanger sequencing, partial RdRp sequences could be retrieved from three Rousettus and eight Pteropus bat specimens. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp region demonstrated distinct subclustering of the BtCoV sequences retrieved from these Rousettus and Pteropus spp. bats. NGS led to the recovery of four sequences covering approximately 94.3 per cent of the whole genome of the BtCoVs from Rousettus bats. Three BtCoV sequences had 93.69 per cent identity to CoV BtRt-BetaCoV/GX2018. The fourth BtCoV sequence was 96.8 per cent identical to BtCoV HKU9-1. Interpretation conclusions: This study was a step towards understanding the CoV circulation in Indian bats. Detection of potentially pathogenic CoVs in Indian bats stresses the need for enhanced screening for novel viruses in them. One Health approach with collaborative activities by the animal health and human health sectors in these surveillance activities shall be of use to public health. This would help in the development of diagnostic assays for novel viruses with outbreak potential and be useful in disease interventions. Proactive surveillance remains crucial for identifying the emerging novel viruses with epidemic potential and measures for risk mitigation.																					WOS:000615044200019	32317409

These include filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses that cause severe diseases such as Ebola virus disease, Marburg haemorrhagic fever and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. The evolution of flight in bats seem to have selected for a unique set of antiviral immune responses that control virus propagation, while limiting self-damaging inflammatory responses. Here, we summarize our current understanding of antiviral immune responses in bats and discuss their ability to co-exist with emerging viruses that cause serious disease in other mammals. We highlight how this knowledge may help us to predict viral spillovers into new hosts and discuss future directions for the field.																					WOS:000511868700001	32117225

Outbreaks in livestock and humans occur after heavy rains favour breeding of vectors, and the virus is thought to survive dry seasons in the eggs of floodwater-breeding aedine mosquitoes. We recently found high seroconversion rates to RVF virus (RVFV) in cattle and goats, in the absence of outbreaks, in far northern KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Here, we report the prevalence of, and factors associated with, neutralizing antibodies to RVFV in 326 sera collected opportunistically from nyala (Tragelaphus angasii) and impala (Aepyceros melampus) culled during 2016-2018 in two nature reserves in the same area. The overall seroprevalence of RVFV, determined using the serum neutralization test, was 35.0% (114/326; 95%CI: 29.8%-40.4%) and tended to be higher in Ndumo Game Reserve (11/20; 55.0%; 95%CI: 31.5%-76.9%) than in Tembe Elephant Park (103/306; 33.6%; 95%CI: 28.4%-39.3%) (p = .087). The presence of antibodies in juveniles (6/21; 28.6%; 95%CI: 11.3%-52.2%) and sub-adults (13/65; 20.0%; 95%CI: 11.1%-37.8%) confirmed that infections had occurred at least until 2016, well after the 2008-2011 RVF outbreaks in South Africa. Odds of seropositivity was higher in adults than in sub-adults (OR = 3.98; 95%CI: 1.83-8.67; p = .001), in males than in females (OR = 2.66; 95%CI: 1.51-4.68; p = .001) and in animals collected <= 2 km from a swamp or floodplain compared with those collected further away (OR = 3.30; 95%CI: 1.70-6.38; p < .001). Under similar ecological conditions, domestic and wild ruminants may play a similar role in maintenance of RVFV circulation and either or both may serve as the mammalian host in a vector-host reservoir system. The study confirms the recent circulation of RVFV in the tropical coastal plain of northern KZN, providing the basis for investigation of factors affecting virus circulation and the role of wildlife in RVF epidemiology.

R.; Flores, Eduardo F.; Weiblen, Rudi								Sequence analysis of nucleoprotein gene reveals the co-circulation of lineages and sublineages of rabies virus in herbivorous in Rio Grande do Sul state, Brazil								BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				51	2			837	846		10.1007/s42770-020-00226-z		JAN 2020		JUN 2020	2020	An unprecedented outbreak of rabies occurred in Rio Grande do Sul state (RS) from 2012 onward, resulting in thousands of bovine deaths, important economic losses, and posing risk to human health. This article describes a genetic analysis of 145 rabies viruses (RABV) recovered from herbivorous from RS between 2012 and 2017, based on partial sequence analysis of the nucleoprotein (N) gene. High nucleotide (nt) identity (95.5 to 100%) and amino acid (aa) similarity (96.7 to 100%) were observed among the analyzed sequences. These sequences displayed a high sequence nt identity/aa similarity with bovine RABV sequences (96.4-97.9%; 98.1-100%, respectively) and vampire bat RABV sequences (96.3-97.5%; 97.8-99.5%). Phylogenetic analyzes based on the N sequence allowed for the segregation of viruses into two distinct clusters. Cluster 1 comprised RABV sequences covering the whole studied period, whereas cluster 2 grouped a lower number of viruses from 2013, 2014, 2015, to 2017. In some cases, viruses obtained from the same region within a short period of time grouped to distinct clusters or sub-clusters, indicating the co-circulation of distinct virus lineages in these outbreaks. The segregation into sub-clusters was also observed for viral sequences obtained from the same region at different times, indicating the involvement of distinct viruses. In summary, partial sequence analyses revealed a high conservation of N protein and the circulation of two lineages and different sublineages of RABV in the region. In addition, our results confirm the suitability of N gene to study the genetic relationships among RABV isolates.																					WOS:000507777300001	31953649	
J	Browne, Sarah K.; Beeler, Judy A.; Roberts, Jeffrey N.								Summary of the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee meeting held to consider evaluation of vaccine candidates for the prevention of respiratory syncytial virus disease in RSV-naive infants								VACCINE				38	2			101	106		10.1016/j.vaccine.2019.10.048				JAN 10 2020	2020	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), is a common cause of serious acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children, causing substantial morbidity and mortality globally. Treatment is mainly supportive and currently there is no licensed preventive vaccine. Clinical trials conducted in the 1960s evaluating a formalin-inactivated RSV vaccine (FI-RSV) in RSV-nave infants resulted in observations of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) following subsequent natural RSV infection in vaccinees. In these studies, infants immunized with FI-RSV had higher rates of severe RSV disease compared with controls. This outcome redirected focus on identifying the immunologic mechanisms that precipitated ERD as a prerequisite to further vaccine development. Improved understanding of the immunopathogenesis of ERD derived from animal models has stimulated development of new candidate vaccines and engendered discussions among RSV experts about the safety data needed to advance these products into the clinic, and ultimately, into the target population of RSV-naIve infants. The recognition that multiple products would soon be ready for testing in infants and children prompted the FDA to hold a Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) meeting to seek perspectives and advice of experts regarding the types and extent of preclinical and clinical data that might be needed to support testing in RSV-naIve infants for specific types of candidate RSV vaccines. Committee members agreed that, if certain conditions are met in preclinical and early clinical studies, it would be reasonable to move forward from studies in adults and older children and into clinical trials evaluating vaccine safety and efficacy in RSV-naive infants. Herein, we review and summarize perspectives on the discussion regarding recommendations for RSV vaccine development in this population.																					WOS:000509612700001	31706809

Human pegivirus 2 exhibits minimal geographic and temporal genetic diversity								VIROLOGY				539				69	79		10.1016/j.virol.2019.10.012				JAN 2 2020	2020	We applied an NGS based target capture approach to amplify HPgV-2 sequences from metagenomic libraries and enable full genome characterization. Despite expanded geographical sampling, sequence variability remains low, with diversity concentrated in approximately 3.3% of all amino acids. Serial samples from one HPgV-2 positive individual co-infected with comparable titers of HIV, HCV, and GBV-C showed that HPgV-2 remains highly stable over several weeks compared to other RNA viruses, despite a similarly error-prone polymerase. The consistent epidemiological association with and structural similarities to HCV, and the weak positive correlation of HCV and HPgV-2 titers shown here, suggests it may benefit from co-infection. While minimal selective pressure on HPgV-2 to evolve could suggest fitness, the rarity of HPgV-2 and the tight phylogenetic clustering of global strains likely indicates origination from a common source and a virus that is ill-suited to its host. Sporadic infections may explain the limited genetic diversity observed worldwide.																					WOS:000504374300008	31689572	
J	Akca, Kevser Taban; Suntar, Ipek								An Overview on Flavonoids as Potential Antiviral Strategies against Coronavirus Infections								GAZI MEDICAL JOURNAL				31	3A	SI		478	484		10.12996/gmj.2020.117				2020	2020	Coronaviruses are zoonotic viruses and can infect people, often causing respiratory and gastrointestinal complaints. Three coronavirus types namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), middle-east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cause pneumonia in human resulting in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). SARS-CoV-2, first appeared in Wuhan, China, in 2019, has rapidly spread to the whole world in a short time due to the speed of transmission rate. Since there is no specific drug for disease prevention and treatment, drug and vaccine development studies are proceeding rapidly. In drug development studies, natural resources draw attention due to their antiviral activity and fewer side effects. Flavonoids, a secondary metabolite group found in higher plants, have a variety of pharmacological activities, including antiviral activity. In this review, flavonoid-type compounds and plant extracts containing these constituents were summarized in terms of their antiviral activity potential against coronavirus-induced infections. Herein, we can suggest that flavonoids shown to possess antiviral effect against SARS and MERS may be used as potential test materials for the studies of novel drug search for ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

HeV repeatedly re-emerges in Australia while NiV continues to cause outbreaks in South Asia (Bangladesh and India), and these viruses have remained transboundary threats. In people and several mammalian species, HeV and NiV infections present as a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. NiV stands out as a potential pandemic threat because of its associated high case-fatality rates and capacity for human-to-human transmission. The development of effective vaccines, suitable for people and livestock, against HeV and NiV has been a research focus. Here, we review the progress made in NiV and HeV vaccine development, with an emphasis on those approaches that have been tested in established animal challengemodels of NiV and HeV infection and disease.

The world has not dealt with such adversities since World War II. The spread has had a devastating and massive impact on global health, the economy, and people's everyday lives. With the crisis looming around the world, there is not yet any report of a clinically approved drug effective against this virus or or vaccine that can prevent people from getting infected. In this article, we describe different types of diagnostic tests currently used to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection. We also present an overview of the basic principles involved, advantages, and the pitfalls associated with each technique. This article also provides an insight into various supplementary diagnostic modalities, including recent advancements in sensing technologies and further clinical improvement and novelties to fight this pandemic.

Interferon (IFN)-alpha was introduced as first treatment for chronic hepatitis C and later was enhanced by pegylation, addition of ribavirin, and resulted in improved sustained virologic response. Better understanding of HCV structure, enzymes, and lifecycle led to the discovery of direct-acting antivirals and IFN-free era. Successful HCV therapy created a rare possibility of global disease eradication, which is now a major goal internationally. However, hepatitis C remains a major public health challenge, and more resources are needed to reach global elimination.																					WOS:000522852200010	31905358

Iss. SI			18	24		10.24321/0019.5138.202021				2020	2020	A newly discovered strain of coronavirus is the causal agent of COVID-19 pandemic. Preliminary findings suggest that this novel coronavirus Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) might have originated in bats, and thereafter crossed the species barrier from an intermediate host; eventually spreading within humans. Bat coronaviruses are older than the coronaviruses identified in other animals and have shown a consistent growth rate. The diverse natures of coronaviruses in different bat species have witnessed repeated introductions and occasional establishment in other animal species. The dispersion of animal diseases and zoonotic pathogens is facilitated by rapid globalization, international trading and the ever-growing flow of goods and people. Climate change coupled with globalization and extensive deforestation can act as a significant selection pressure which can lead to onsets of future coronavirus transmission cycles. Climate change alters the availability of viable habitat for the hosts as well which results in the redistribution of host ranges and host densities relative to habitat resources. An attempt has been made in this review to assess and analyze the possible causes of the emergence of a zoonotic pathogen having pandemic potential, the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its subsequent spill over to humans causing COVID-19.

Antibodies directed against the NiV-glycoprotein (G) protein are known to play a major role in clearing NiV infection and in providing vaccine-induced protective immunity. More recently, T cells have been also shown to be involved in recovery from NiV infection. So far, relatively little is known about the role of T cell responses and the antigenic targets of NiV-G that are recognized by CD8 T cells. In this study, NiV-G protein served as the target immunogen to activate NiV-specific cellular immune responses. Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), a safety-tested strain of vaccinia virus for preclinical and clinical vaccine research, was used for the generation of MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines expressing different versions of recombinant NiV-G. Overlapping peptides covering the entire NiV-G protein were used to identify major histocompatibility complex class I/II-restricted T cell responses in type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFNAR-/-) mice after vaccination with the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines. We have identified an H2-b-restricted nonamer peptide epitope with CD8 T cell antigenicity and a H2-b 15mer with CD4 T cell antigenicity in the NiV-G protein. The identification of this epitope and the availability of the MVA-NiV-G candidate vaccines will help to evaluate NiV-G-specific immune responses and the potential immune correlates of vaccine-mediated protection in the appropriate murine models of NiV-G infection. Of note, a soluble version of NiV-G was advantageous in activating NiV-G-specific cellular immune responses using these peptides.																					WOS:000515930700071	31878180

Sharif								A REVIEW OF CORONAVIRUS 2019 (COVID-19), A LIFE THREATING DISEASE ALL OVER THE WORLD								WORLD CANCER RESEARCH JOURNAL				7						e1586					2020	2020	An outbreak of a new virus novel coronavirus (COVID-19 or 2019-CoV) infection has modeled significant extortions to the economy and international health. This virus affects the lower respiratory tract and manifests as pneumonia in humans. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with 752,747 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 36,226 deaths worldwide. In the absence of any vaccine for this virus, there is an urgent need to find alternative methods to control the spread of disease. Here we have directed an online for all options for treating this coronavirus infection as well as some RNA virus infection. Further, we have also found that general treatments, coronavirus-specific treatments, and antiviral treatments should be useful in fighting COVID-19. We suggest some nutritional elements that can protect us from the infection of this virus. Also, we can use convalescent plasma to COVID-19 patients if it is available. In conclusion, we suggest some potential interventions to control the emerging COVID-19 if the infection is uncontrollable.																					WOS:000540441200001

These facilities play a critical role in the national infrastructure, supporting research on a select set of especially dangerous pathogens, as well as novel, emerging diseases. Understanding the ecology, biology, and pathology at the human-animal interface of zoonotic spillover events is fundamental to efficient control and elimination of disease. The use of animals as human surrogate models or as target-host models in research is an integral part of unraveling the interrelated components involved in these dynamic systems. These models can prove vitally important in determining both viral- and host-factors associated with virus transmission, providing invaluable information that can be developed into better risk mitigation strategies. In this article, we focus on the use of livestock in maximum-containment, biosafety level-4 agriculture (BSL-4Ag) research involving zoonotic, risk group 4 pathogens and we provide an overview of historical associated research and contributions. Livestock are most commonly used as target-host models in high-consequence, maximum-containment research and are routinely used to establish data to assist in risk assessments. This article highlights the importance of animal use, insights gained, and how this type of research is essential for protecting animal health, food security, and the agriculture economy, as well as human public health in the face of emerging zoonotic pathogens. The utilization of animal models in high-consequence pathogen research and continued expansion to include available species of agricultural importance is essential to deciphering the ecology of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, as well as for emergency response and mitigation preparedness.

The virus was first reported from Wuhan city in China in December, 2019, which in less than three months spread throughout the globe and was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11th of March, 2020. So far, the ongoing pandemic severely damaged the world's most developed countries and is becoming a major threat for low- and middle-income countries. The poorest continent, Africa with the most vulnerable populations to infectious diseases, is predicted to be significantly affected by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, in this review we collected and summarized the currently available literature on the epidemiology, etiology, vulnerability, preparedness and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa, which could be useful and provide necessary information on ongoing COVID-19 pandemics in the continent. We also briefly summarized the concomitance of the COVID-19 pandemic and global warming.																					WOS:000546849200001	32458760

In this study we interviewed horse owners (N=15) and veterinarians (N=10), revealing how expert knowledge, disqualification of lay knowledge and inadequate handling of uncertainty impacted divisive discourse around Hendra virus. We assert that more inclusive, reflective and ultimately more effective risk communication practices will result if the legitimacy of diverse knowledge sources and the inevitability of uncertainty are acknowledged.

Susceptibility of swine cells and domestic pigs to SARS-CoV-2								EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS				9	1			2278	2288		10.1080/22221751.2020.1831405				JAN 1 2020	2020	The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in an ongoing global pandemic with significant morbidity, mortality, and economic consequences. The susceptibility of different animal species to SARS-CoV-2 is of concern due to the potential for interspecies transmission, and the requirement for pre-clinical animal models to develop effective countermeasures. In the current study, we determined the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to (i) replicate in porcine cell lines, (ii) establish infection in domestic pigs via experimental oral/intranasal/intratracheal inoculation, and (iii) transmit to co-housed naive sentinel pigs. SARS-CoV-2 was able to replicate in two different porcine cell lines with cytopathic effects. Interestingly, none of the SARS-CoV-2-inoculated pigs showed evidence of clinical signs, viral replication or SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses. Moreover, none of the sentinel pigs displayed markers of SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data indicate that although different porcine cell lines are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, five-week old pigs are not susceptible to infection via oral/intranasal/intratracheal challenge. Pigs are therefore unlikely to be significant carriers of SARS-CoV-2 and are not a suitable pre-clinical animal model to study SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis or efficacy of respective vaccines or therapeutics.

This achievement guided all the steps in identifying the elements of the virus, in order to develop the treatment and to increase the screening solutions, which have slowed the exposure to the virus. The management of infection started with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), which has later enhanced by adding Ribavirin. Nowadays, HCV treatment is based on direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). Currently, HCV infection benefits of curative treatment, with which most patients can be cured. When speaking about hepatitis C future, we can say it is looking bright, considering all the progress that has been made in recent years and all the options that we have for curing all genotypes of HCV infection. The aim of this review is to sum up the historical characteristics of HCV discovery, the evolution of treatment and screening actions, gaps, and stages for achieving the international elimination target of the World Health Organization.

To understand how this virus causes disease, the molecular biology of the virus needs to be studied in more detail. There is a large body of work on the molecular strategies of previous coronaviruses that infected humans, which can be directly applied to SARS-CoV-2. In the current review we highlight the novel aspects of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus life cycle, and how this and other viruses interact with the biochemistry of the host organism. We provide a discussion of different types of viruses as a background to understand coronaviruses. Specifically, we compare the life cycles of coronaviruses with that of a model retrovirus, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). We describe the genomic, transcription and translation control features of coronaviruses with a focus on protein structures and activities that can be selected as molecular targets of therapy.

Coronavirus was not thought to be a significant problem in humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, but infections in animals, including pigs, cats, dogs, and poultry, have been problematic for a long time. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, drew special attention towards this virus once again. The intermediate host of this novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is yet to be determined, but it has a very close genomic relationship with the bat coronavirus (Bat-CoV), RaTG13 strain and the pangolin coronaviruses. As veterinary medicine has a long-term experience dealing with coronaviruses, this could be helpful in better understanding and detecting the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and drive human medicine towards the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs through the collaborative and tansdisciplinary approaches of One Health.

It prompted a mobilization around the globe to study the underlying pathogen, a close relative of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Numerous genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are now available and in-depth analyses are advancing. These will allow detailed characterization of sequence and protein functions, including comparative studies. Care should be taken when inferring function from sequence information alone, and reverse genetics systems can be used to unequivocally identify key features. For example, the molecular markers of virulence, host range and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 can be compared to those of related viruses in order to shed light on the biology of this emerging pathogen. Here, we summarize some recent insights from genomic studies and strategies for reverse genetics systems to generate recombinant viruses, which will be useful to investigate viral genome properties and evolution.

In vivo comparison of a laboratory-adapted and clinical-isolate-based recombinant human respiratory syncytial virus								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				101	10			1037	1046		10.1099/jgv.0.001468				2020	2020	Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory tract disease in infants. Most HRSV infections remain restricted to the upper respiratory tract (URT), but in a small percentage of patients the infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract, resulting in bronchiolitis or pneumonia. We have a limited understanding of HRSV pathogenesis and what factors determine disease severity, partly due to the widespread use of tissue-culture-adapted viruses. Here, we studied early viral dissemination and tropism of HRSV in cotton rats, BALB/cJ mice and C57BL/6 mice. We used a novel recombinant (r) strain based on a subgroup A clinical isolate (A11) expressing EGFP [rHRSVA(11)EGFP(5)]. A recombinant laboratory-adapted HRSV strain [rHRSV(A2)EGFP(5)] was used as a direct comparison. Our results show that rHRSVA(11)EGFP(5) replicated to higher viral titres than laboratory-adapted rHRSV(A2)EGFP(5) in the URT of cotton rats and mice. HRSV-infected cells were detected as early as 2days post-inoculation in both species in the nasal septa and lungs. Infection was predominantly present in ciliated epithelial cells in cotton rats and in the olfactory mucosa of mice. In our opinion, this study highlights that the choice of virus strain is important when studying HRSV pathogenesis in vivo and demonstrates that A11 is a representative clinical-based virus. Additionally, we show critical differences in tropism and inflammation when comparing HRSV infection of cotton rats and mice.																					WOS:000588205200004	32692644

N.; Singh, Sujeet Kumar								Challenges and Threats due to Deadly Corona Virus in India and Dealing it with Social Vaccine (distancing) - the Only Weapon								Journal of Communicable Diseases				52	1			7	13		10.24321/0019.5138.202002				2020	2020	The whole world is, presently, reeling under a serious crisis due to wide spread of a very unique and deadly corona virus. It is said to have originated from China and spread over more than 200 countries across the world. There have been reports of high mortality and morbidity in China, Spain, Italy, USA, UK and France due to wide spread of this dangerous and contagious disease. Unfortunately, this war is being fought by the frontline warriors i.e. doctors, nurses, health workers, sanitary staff but, with no real weapon presently, as no drug or vaccine has been found effective to deal with this deadly virus. The spread/transmission cycle is very fast due to its very highly contagious nature and fast multiplication. Though, India has made all concerted efforts from the very beginning with all proactive actions and preparedness to deal with the situation due to coronavirus, yet it is becoming a Challenging task in some hotspots due to lack of social distancing or lockdown by some people in the community. The first phase of lockdown in the whole country started on 25th March for 21 days in order to break down the chain of transmission. However, due to its spread in some hotspots, it has been extended for another 19 days so as to well control the clusters and to prevent further spread. In an address to the Nation, Dr. Harsh Vardhan, Hon. Health Minister of India stressed the need of social distancing and lockdown as comprehensive strategy for prevention and break the chain of transmission for coronavirus and term social distancing as "social vaccine" besides other measures being taken for diagnosis and treatment. An attempt has been made in this manuscript to describe the challenges and threats caused by deadly corona virus in India with the benefits of social vaccine (distancing)-the only weapon to prevent and break the transmission.

The aim of this review is a comprehensive analysis of current literature data on coronaviruses identified in bats.Discussion. Coronaviruses (Coronaviridae) constitute the most extensive family of viruses of the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses have a wide range of hosts, including mammals (Alpha coronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Deltacoronavirus, Gamn7acoronavirus) and birds (Deltacoronavirus, Garnmacoronavirus), amphibians (Alphaietovirus) and are pathogens of respiratory, intestinal, cardiovascular. Until the beginning of this century, only etiological agents of mild and moderate respiratory diseases were known among pathogenic coronaviruses for humans. In the 21st century, new highly pathogenic coronaviruses were discovered that caused outbreaks of severe pneumonia with high mortality: the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, SARS-CoV; 2002-2003, southern provinces of China), the Middle East respiratory coronavirus Syndrome (Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, MERS-CoV; 2012, western part of Saudi Arabia) and type 2 acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2; 2019 -..., the eastern part of central China). The natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV are bats (Chiroptera). Coronaviruses circulating in bat populations are not only phylogenetically close to the currently known especially dangerous human viruses but probably have epidemic potential that can be realized in the future.Conclusion. This review presents current data on coronaviruses of bats: taxonomic status, spectrum of potential hosts, distribution. The ecological features of coronaviruses of bats are considered in the context of their epidemiological significance. The origin of pathogenic human coronaviruses is discussed.

In Africa, circulation in sylvatic, enzootic cycles involves several species of arboreal mosquito vectors that transmit among diverse nonhuman primates and possibly other amplifying hosts. Most disease occurs when CHIKV emerges into a human-amplified cycle involving Aedes aegypti and sometimes Aedes albopictus transmission and extensive spread via travelers. Epidemiologic studies suggest that the transition from enzootic to epidemic cycles begins when people are infected via spillover in forests. However, efficient human amplification likely only ensues far from enzootic habitats where peridomestic vector and human densities are adequate. Recent outbreaks have been enhanced by mutations that adapt CHIKV for more efficient infection of Ae. albopictus, allowing for geographic expansion. However, epistatic interactions, sometimes resulting from founder effects following point-source human introductions, have profound effects on transmission efficiency, making CHIKV emergence somewhat unpredictable.

The virus emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, has spread across the world as a global pandemic. The traditional use of medicines from plants can be traced back to 60,000 years. Global interest in the development of drugs from natural products has increased greatly during the last few decades. Essential oils (EOs) have been studied through the centuries and are known to possess various pharmaceutical properties. In the present review, we have highlighted the current biology, epidemiology, various clinical aspects, different diagnostic techniques, clinical symptoms, and management of COVID-19. An overview of the antiviral action of EOs, along with their proposed mechanism of action and in silico studies conducted, is described. The reported studies of EOs' antiviral activity highlight the baseline data about the additive and/or synergistic effects among primary or secondary phytoconstituents found in individual oils, combinations or blends of oils and between EOs and antiviral drugs. It is hoped that further research will provide better insights into EOs' potential to limit viral infection and aid in providing solutions through natural, therapeutically active agents.

BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH AND THERAPY				7	11			4086	4099		10.15419/bmrat.v7i11.646				2020	2020	Up to now, no vaccine has been developed for COVID-19 treatment. Although many scientists are working for the rapid development of a vaccine to control this pandemic, nonetheless, it will take time. If the vaccine will be developed soon, it will not be available to the entire world instantly since the mass production of the vaccine will take time. In this scenario, we will have to take alternative measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic. These alternative approaches include the stimulation of the immune system to fight against viral infections. Among the different approaches to strengthen the immune system, the use of probiotics is the best one. Probiotics can help the body to fight against COVID-19 directly and indirectly. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the use of probiotics for the prevention and control of COVID-19.																					WOS:000602585900001

We evaluated vector competence of five sylvatic Neotropical mosquito species to two ZIKV isolates. Distinct batches of Haemagogus leucoceleanus, Sabethes albiprivus, Sabethes identicus, Aedes terrens and Aedes scapularis females were respectively orally challenged and inoculated intrathoracically with ZIKV. Orally challenged mosquitoes were refractory or exhibited low infection rates. Viral dissemination was detected only in Hg. leucocelaenus, but with very low rates. Virus was not detected in saliva of any mosquito orally challenged with ZIKV, regardless of viral isolate and incubation time. When intrathoracically injected, ZIKV disseminated in high rates in Hg. leucocelaenus, Sa. identicus and Sa. albpiprivus, but low transmission was detected in these species; very low dissemination and no transmission was detected in Ae. terrens and Ae. scapularis. Together these results suggest that genetically determined tissue barriers, especially in the midgut, play a vital role in inhibiting ZIKV for transmission in the tested sylvatic mosquito species. Thus, an independent enzootic transmission cycle for ZIKV in South America is very unlikely.																					WOS:000509340400030	31882976

The discovery that dedicated cellular genes control various aspects of this periodicity has led to studies of the molecular mechanism of the circadian response at the cellular level. It is now established that the circadian genes impact on a large network of hormonal, metabolic, and immunological pathways, affecting multiple aspects of biology. Recent studies have extended the role of the circadian system to the regulation of infection, host-pathogen interaction, and the resultant disease outcome. This critical review summarizes our current knowledge of circadian-pathogen interaction at both systemic and cellular levels, but with emphasis on the molecular aspects of the regulation. Wherever applicable, the potential of a direct interaction between circadian factors and pathogenic macromolecules is also explored. Finally, this review offers new directions and guidelines for future research in this area, which should facilitate progress.																					WOS:000504428300006	31756974

Effective vaccines for prophylaxis are only available for several flaviviruses such as Yellow Fever virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Dengue Virus and Japanese Encephalitis Virus and there is no antiflaviviral agent being marketed. This review discusses the flavivirus genome, replication cycle, epidemiology, clinical presentation and pathogenesis upon infection. Effective humoral response is critical to confer protective immunity against flaviviruses. Hence, we have also highlighted the immune responses elicited upon infection, various diagnostic facilities available for flaviviral disease and monoclonal antibodies available to date against flavivirus infection.

Recent Findings Hepatitis E virus (HEV) emerged in the last two decades, causing hepatitis in many parts of the world. Moreover, liver involvement was also described in some emerging arboviral infections. Many reports showed dengue-associated liver injury; however, chikungunya, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, and Zika virus are rarely associated with clinically manifest liver disease. In addition, some neglected highly prevalent viruses such as adenoviruses and parvovirus B19 are capable of causing hepatitis in specific population groups. Anelloviruses (torque teno virus/torque teno mini virus/torque teno midi virus, SEN virus), human bocavirus, pegiviruses, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus have shown a little potential for causing hepatitis, but their role in the etiology of liver disease remains to be determined. In addition to the well-known hepatotropic viruses, many emerging and neglected viruses have been associated with liver diseases. The number of emerging zoonotic viruses has been increasingly recognized. While zoonotic potential of HEV is well documented, the recent identification of new hepatitis-related animal viruses such as HEV strains from rabbits and camels, non-primate hepaciviruses in domestic dogs and horses, as well as equine and porcine pegivirus highlights the possible zoonotic transmission in the context of "One Health." However, zoonotic potential and hepatotropism of animal hepatitis viruses remain to be determined.																					WOS:000499461100002	31754812

The disease is endemic in Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and outbreaks occur after periods of high rainfall, or in environments supporting the proliferation of RVF virus (RVFV)-infected mosquito vectors. The domestic and wild animal maintenance hosts of RVFV, which may serve as sources of virus during inter-epidemic periods (IEPs) and contribute to occurrence of sporadic outbreaks, remain unknown, although reports indicate that the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) may play a role. Due to the close proximity of the habitats of domestic pigs and warthogs to those of known domestic and wild ruminant RVFV maintenance hosts respectively, our study investigated their possible role in the epidemiology of RVF in South Africa by evaluating RVFV exposure and seroconversion in suids. A total of 107 warthog and 3,984 domestic pig sera from 2 and all 9 provinces of South Africa, respectively, were screened for presence of RVFV neutralizing antibodies using the virus neutralization test (VNT). Sero-positivity rates of 1.87% (95% CI: 0.01%-6.9%) and 0.68% (95% CI: 0.49%-1.04%) were observed for warthogs and domestic pigs, respectively, but true prevalence rates, taking test sensitivity and specificity into account, were lower for both groups. There was a strong association between the results of the two groups (chi(2) = 0.75, p = .38), and differences in prevalence between the epidemic and IEPs were non-significant for all suid samples tested (p > .05). This study, which provides the first evidence of probable exposure and infection of South African domestic pigs and warthogs to RVFV, indicates that further investigations are warranted, to fully clarify the role of suids in the epidemiology of RVF.

Certain viral zoonoses are endemic and unique to Saudi Arabia and can be attributed to large number of reservoir animals and arthropods, regular influx of expatriate workforce from different countries, and yearly, large mass religious gathering for the Hajj. An analysis of the published epidemiologic studies of zoonotic and vector-borne viral infections that have occurred in Saudi Arabia was conducted to present a descriptive analysis of such diseases with a particular emphasis on influenza, MERS-CoV and viral hemorrhagic fevers such as dengue, Alkhurma, Rift Valley fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and the recent reports of vCJD. The inevitable risk of infection can be minimized and the outbreak of disease can be contained by increasing public awareness of sources and modes of transmission of these diseases. In addition, better diagnostics can improve early diagnosis, helping to reduce spread of the disease and related morbidity and mortality in the region.																					WOS:000515195700007

We investigated the prevalence and genetic diversity of HBV in bats in China. In this study, a total of 197 insectivorous bats belonging to 10 bat species were captured from karst caves in Mengyin County, Shandong Province and Xianning City, Hubei Province, China. PCR amplification indicated that in total 6.6% (13/197) bats were positive to HBVs. The HBV positive rate in bats was 7.1% (9/127) and 5.7% (4/70) in Shandong Province and Hubei Province, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that HBV from the two places were in the same cluster with 90.5%-99.5% homology, but distinct from bat HBVs from other places in China and other countries. We concluded that HBV was prevalent and genetic diversified in bats, supporting the hypothesis that bats may be the origin of primate hepadnaviruses.

Rousette Bat Dendritic Cells Overcome Marburg Virus-Mediated Antiviral Responses by Upregulation of Interferon-Related Genes While Downregulating Proinflammatory Disease Mediators								MSPHERE				4	6					e00728-19	10.1128/mSphere.00728-19				NOV-DEC 2019	2019	Dysregulated and maladaptive immune responses are at the forefront of human diseases caused by infection with zoonotic viral hemorrhagic fever viruses. Elucidating mechanisms of how the natural animal reservoirs of these viruses coexist with these agents without overt disease, while permitting sufficient replication to allow for transmission and maintenance in a population, is important for understanding the viral ecology and spillover to humans. The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) has been identified as a reservoir for Marburg virus (MARV), a filovirus and the etiological agent of the highly lethal Marburg virus disease. Little is known regarding how these bats immunologically respond to MARV infection. In humans, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) are primary targets of infection, and their dysregulation is thought to play a central role in filovirus diseases, by disturbing their normal functions as innate sensors and adaptive immune response facilitators while serving as amplification and dissemination agents for the virus. The infection status and responses to MARV in bat myeloid-lineage cells are uncharacterized and likely represent an important modulator of the bat's immune response to MARV infection. Here, we generate DCs from the bone marrow of rousette bats. Infection with a bat isolate of MARV resulted in a low level of transcription in these cells and significantly downregulated DC maturation and adaptive immune-stimulatory pathways while simultaneously upregulating interferon-related pathogen-sensing pathways. This study provides a first insight into how the bat immune response is directed toward preventing aberrant inflammatory responses while mounting an antiviral response to defend against MARV infection.IMPORTANCE Marburg viruses (MARVs) cause severe human disease resulting from aberrant immune responses. Dendritic cells (DCs) are primary targets of infection and are dysregulated by MARV. Dysregulation of DCs facilitates MARV replication and virus dissemination and influences downstream immune responses that result in immunopathology. Egyptian rousette bats (ERBs) are natural reservoirs of MARV, and infection results in virus replication and shedding, with asymptomatic control of the virus within weeks. The mechanisms that bats employ to appropriately respond to infection while avoiding disease are unknown. Because DC infection and modulation are important early events in human disease, we measured the transcriptional responses of ERB DCs to MARV. The significance of this work is in identifying cell type-specific coevolved responses between ERBs and MARV, which gives insight into how bat reservoirs are able to harbor MARV and permit viral replication, allowing transmission and maintenance in the population while simultaneously preventing immunopathogenesis.

Route of Infection Influences Zika Virus Shedding in a Guinea Pig Model								CELLS				8	11					1437	10.3390/cells8111437				NOV 2019	2019	Due to the recent epidemic of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and resulting sequelae, as well as concerns about both the sexual and vertical transmission of the virus, renewed attention has been paid to the pathogenesis of this unique arbovirus. Numerous small animal models have been used in various ZIKV pathogenicity studies, however, they are often performed using immunodeficient or immunosuppressed animals, which may impact disease progression in a manner not relevant to immunocompetent humans. The use of immunocompetent animal models, such as macaques, is constrained by small sample sizes and the need for specialized equipment/staff. Here we report the establishment of ZIKV infection in an immunocompetent small animal model, the guinea pig, using both subcutaneous and vaginal routes of infection to mimic mosquito-borne and sexual transmission. Guinea pigs developed clinical signs consistent with mostly asymptomatic and mild disease observed in humans. We demonstrate that the route of infection does not significantly alter viral tissue tropism but does impact mucosal shedding mechanics. We also demonstrate persistent infection in sensory and autonomic ganglia, identifying a previously unrecognized niche of viral persistence that could contribute to viral shedding in secretions. We conclude that the guinea pig represents a useful and relevant model for ZIKV pathogenesis.																					WOS:000502266700135	31739508

There is little information for prevalence and circulation of HPgV-1 in this remote Brazilian region.Materials and methods. - We conducted a study evaluating the HPgV-1 RNA prevalence and circulating genotypes in 431 volunteer blood donors originating from the Eastern Brazilian Amazon. The obtained HPgV-1 positive samples were submitted to sequencing and genotyping analysis in order to examine the genotype diversity of this virus in the Brazilian Amazon.Results. - Our results demonstrated a prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA in 9.5% of the tested blood donors. The phylogenetic analyses of the detected positive samples showed the presence of HPgV-1 genotypes 1, 2 and 3. The most frequently detected genotype was 2 (78.0% of the cases) represented by sub-genotypes 2A (39.0%) and 2B (39.0%). At lower rates, genotypes 1 (14.6%) and 3 (7.4%) were also detected.Conclusion. - Our results revealed the presence of genotypes with European, Asiatic and African endemicity in Amazonian blood donors, probably due to the complex miscegenation processes that took place in this Brazilian region. More investigations, including information for the prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA in blood donors from other Latin American countries are needed to estimate the viremic rates and genotype distribution of this virus in a highly diverse continent like South America.

MBFVs are phylogenetically divided into two clades, one is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (Ae-MBFVs) associated with mammals and the other by Culex mosquitoes (Cx-MBFVs) associated with birds. However, this assumption has not been evaluated. Here, we synthesized 79 published reports of MBFVs from wild mammals, estimating their host. Then, we tested whether the host specificity was biased to sampling and investigation efforts or to phylogenetic relationships using a viral phylogenetic tree drawn from analyzing whole flavivirus genomes obtained in GenBank. We found in total 18 flaviviruses, nine related to Aedes spp. and nine to Culex spp. infecting 129 mammal species. Thus, this supports that vectors are transmitting MBFV across available host clades and that ornithophilic mosquitoes are readily infecting mammals. Although most of the mosquito species are generalists in their host-feeding preferences, we also found a certain degree of MBFV's specificity, as most of them infect closely related mammal species. The present study integrates knowledge regarding MBFVs, and it may help to understand their transmission dynamics between viruses, vectors, and mammal hosts.

Multidecade Mortality and a Homolog of Hepatitis C Virus in Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), the National Bird of the USA								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						14953	10.1038/s41598-019-50580-8				OCT 18 2019	2019	The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) once experienced near-extinction but has since rebounded. For decades, bald eagles near the Wisconsin River, USA, have experienced a lethal syndrome with characteristic clinical and pathological features but unknown etiology. Here, we describe a novel hepacivirus-like virus (Flaviviridae: Hepacivirus) identified during an investigation of Wisconsin River eagle syndrome (WRES). Bald eagle hepacivirus (BeHV) belongs to a divergent clade of avian viruses that share features with members of the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus. BeHV infected 31.9% of eagles spanning 4,254 km of the coterminous USA, with negative strand viral RNA demonstrating active replication in liver tissues. Eagles from Wisconsin were approximately 10-fold more likely to be infected than eagles from elsewhere. Eagle mitochondrial DNA sequences were homogeneous and geographically unstructured, likely reflecting a recent population bottleneck, whereas BeHV envelope gene sequences showed strong population genetic substructure and isolation by distance, suggesting localized transmission. Cophylogenetic analyses showed no congruity between eagles and their viruses, supporting horizontal rather than vertical transmission. These results expand our knowledge of the Flaviviridae, reveal a striking pattern of decoupled host/virus coevolution on a continental scale, and highlight knowledge gaps about health and conservation in even the most iconic of wildlife species.

Human DCs, infected with Ebola virus aberrantly express low levels of the DC activation markers CD80, CD86, and MHC class II. The T cell responses ensuing are commonly anergic rather than protective against EVD. We hypothesize that DCs derived from potential reservoir hosts such as bats, which do not develop disease signs in response to Ebola virus infection, would exhibit features associated with activation. In this study, we have examined Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) infection of DCs derived from the Angolan free-tailed bat species, Mops condylurus. This species was previously identified as permissive to EBOV infection in vivo, in the absence of disease signs. M. condylurus has also been recently implicated as the reservoir host for Bombali ebolavirus, a virus species that is closely related to EBOV. Due to the absence of pre-existing M. condylurus species-specific reagents, we characterized its de novo assembled transcriptome and defined its phylogenetic similarity to other mammals, which enabled the identification of cross-reactive reagents for M. condylurus bone marrow-derived DC (bat-BMDC) differentiation and immune cell phenotyping. Our results reveal that bat-BMDCs are susceptible to EBOV infection as determined by detection of EBOV specific viral RNA (vRNA). vRNA increased significantly 72 h after EBOV-infection and was detected in both cells and in culture supernatants. Bat-BMDC infection was further confirmed by the observation of GFP expression in DC cultures infected with a recombinant GFP-EBOV. Bat-BMDCs upregulated CD80 and chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3) transcripts in response to EBOV infection, which positively correlated with the expression levels of EBOV vRNA. In contrast to the aberrant responses to EBOV infection that are typical for human-DC, our findings from bat-BMDCs provide evidence for an immunological basis of asymptomatic EBOV infection outcomes.

CedV receptor-binding protein (G) shares only similar to 30% sequence identity with those of NiV and HeV, although they can all use ephrin-B2 as an entry receptor. We demonstrate that CedV also enters cells through additional B- and A-class ephrins (ephrin-B1, ephrin-A2, and ephrin-A5) and report the crystal structure of the CedV G ectodomain alone and in complex with ephrin-B1 or ephrin-B2. The CedV G receptor-binding site is structurally distinct from other henipaviruses, underlying its capability to accommodate additional ephrin receptors. We also show that CedV can enter cells through mouse ephrin-A1 but not human ephrin-A1, which differ by 1 residue in the key contact region. This is evidence of species specific ephrin receptor usage by a henipavirus, and implicates additional ephrin receptors in potential zoonotic transmission.

Advanced immunological studies would add substantial value to the ferret models of disease but are hindered by the low number of ferret-reactive reagents available for flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Nevertheless, progress has been made to understand immune responses in the ferret model with a limited set of ferret-specific reagents and assays. This review examines current immunological insights gained from the ferret model across relevant human respiratory diseases, with a focus on influenza viruses. We highlight key knowledge gaps that need to be bridged to advance the utility of ferrets for immunological studies.																					WOS:000489183600001	31583825

No vaccines or licensed therapeutics currently exist to protect humans against NiV or HeV. HNVs enter host cells by fusing the viral and cellular membranes via the concerted action of the attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, the main targets of the humoral immune response. Here, we describe the isolation and humanization of a potent monoclonal antibody cross-neutralizing NiV and HeV. Cryo-electron microscopy, triggering and fusion studies show the antibody binds to a prefusion-specific quaternary epitope, conserved in NiV F and HeV F glycoproteins, and prevents membrane fusion and viral entry. This work supports the importance of the HNV prefusion F conformation for eliciting a robust immune response and paves the way for using this antibody for prophylaxis and post-exposure therapy with NiV- and HeV-infected individuals.

However, most human pathogens target other cell types, including epithelial, endothelial and mesenchymal cells. Here, we show that implantation of human lung tissue, which contains up to 40 cell types, including nonhematopoietic cells, into immunodeficient mice (lung-only mice) resulted in the development of a highly vascularized lung implant. We demonstrate that emerging and clinically relevant human pathogens such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Zika virus, respiratory syncytial virus and cytomegalovirus replicate in vivo in these lung implants. When incorporated into bone marrow/liver/thymus humanized mice, lung implants are repopulated with autologous human hematopoietic cells. We show robust antigen-specific humoral and T-cell responses following cytomegalovirus infection that control virus replication. Lung-only mice and bone marrow/liver/thymus-lung humanized mice substantially increase the number of human pathogens that can be studied in vivo, facilitating the in vivo testing of therapeutics.

Modelling mechanisms of henipavirus circulation in fruit bat hosts								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				374	1782					20190021	10.1098/rstb.2019.0021				SEP 30 2019	2019	Pathogen circulation among reservoir hosts is a precondition for zoonotic spillover. Unlike the acute, high morbidity infections typical in spillover hosts, infected reservoir hosts often exhibit low morbidity and mortality. Although it has been proposed that reservoir host infections may be persistent with recurrent episodes of shedding, direct evidence is often lacking. We construct a generalized SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) framework encompassing 46 sub-models representing the full range of possible transitions among those four states of infection and immunity. We then use likelihood-based methods to fit these models to nine years of longitudinal data on henipavirus serology from a captive colony of Eidolon helvum bats in Ghana. We find that reinfection is necessary to explain observed dynamics; that acute infectious periods may be very short (hours to days); that immunity, if present, lasts about 1-2 years; and that recurring latent infection is likely. Although quantitative inference is sensitive to assumptions about serology, qualitative predictions are robust. Our novel approach helps clarify mechanisms of viral persistence and circulation in wild bats, including estimated ranges for key parameters such as the basic reproduction number and the duration of the infectious period. Our results inform how future field-based and experimental work could differentiate the processes of viral recurrence and reinfection in reservoir hosts.This article is part of the theme issue 'Dynamic and integrative approaches to understanding pathogen spillover'.

Immunosenescence and human vaccine immune responses								IMMUNITY & AGEING				16	1					25	10.1186/s12979-019-0164-9				SEP 13 2019	2019	The age-related dysregulation and decline of the immune system-collectively termed "immunosenescence"-has been generally associated with an increased susceptibility to infectious pathogens and poor vaccine responses in older adults. While numerous studies have reported on the clinical outcomes of infected or vaccinated individuals, our understanding of the mechanisms governing the onset of immunosenescence and its effects on adaptive immunity remains incomplete. Age-dependent differences in T and B lymphocyte populations and functions have been well-defined, yet studies that demonstrate direct associations between immune cell function and clinical outcomes in older individuals are lacking. Despite these knowledge gaps, research has progressed in the development of vaccine and adjuvant formulations tailored for older adults in order to boost protective immunity and overcome immunosenescence. In this review, we will discuss the development of vaccines for older adults in light of our current understanding-or lack thereof-of the aging immune system. We highlight the functional changes that are known to occur in the adaptive immune system with age, followed by a discussion of current, clinically relevant pathogens that disproportionately affect older adults and are the central focus of vaccine research efforts for the aging population. We conclude with an outlook on personalized vaccine development for older adults and areas in need of further study in order to improve our fundamental understanding of adaptive immunosenescence.

From its current global rollout, HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality has been greatly reduced, yet there exists substantial interest in the development of new therapies to further mitigate the HIV/AIDS health burden and to inhibit any fallout from the development of antiretroviral drug resistance. One potential intervention is the human pegivirus (HPgV). HPgV is not known to cause disease, and most remarkably it is shown to delay the progression of HIV to AIDS. However, the health benefit of increasing HPgV prevalence in the community of HIV-infected men remains unknown at the public health level. We evaluated the utility of HPgV biovaccination for mitigating the HIV/AIDS health burden using mathematical models. Importantly, our work considers the potential concern that HPgV will, itself, evolve to become disease-causing by permitting mutant disease-causing HPgV strains to potentially arise during treatment. Our findings show that HPgV biovaccination rates of 12.5%-50% annually could prevent 4.2-23.6 AIDS incidences and 3.3-18.8 AIDS deaths, and could save 2.9-18.6 disability-adjusted life years per 1,000 people. Together, these findings indicate that HPgV biovaccination could be an effective therapy for reducing HIV/AIDS morbidity and mortality, and thus warrants further exploration.

The viral protein NSs is the key virulence factor of RVFV, and has been proposed that NSs nuclear filament formation is critical for its virulence. However, the detailed mechanisms are currently unclear. Here, we generated a T7 RNA polymerase-driven RVFV reverse genetics system based on a strain imported into China (BJ01). Several NSs mutations (T1, T3 and T4) were introduced into the system for investigating the correlation between NSs filament formation and virulence in vivo. The NSs T1 mutant showed distinct NSs filament in the nuclei of infected cells, the T3 mutant diffusively localized in the cytoplasm and the T4 mutant showed fragmented nuclear filament formation. Infection of BALB/c mice with these NSs mutant viruses revealed that the in vivo virulence was severely compromised for all three NSs mutants, including the T1 mutant. This suggests that NSs filament formation is not directly correlated with RVFV virulence in vivo. Results from this study not only shed new light on the virulence mechanism of RVFV NSs but also provided tools for future in-depth investigations of RVFV pathogenesis and anti-RVFV drug screening.

The highest MHC variability, both in terms of the number of individual alleles and gene copies, has so far been found in passerine birds; this is probably attributable to passerine adaptation to both a wide geographic range and a diverse array of habitats. If extraordinary high MHC variation and duplication rates are adaptive features under selection during the evolution of ecologically and taxonomically diverse species, then similarly diverse MHC architectures should be found in bats. Bats are an extremely species-rich mammalian group that is globally widely distributed. Many bat species roost in multitudinous groups and have high contact rates with pathogens, conspecifics, and allospecifics. We have characterized the MHC class I diversity in 116 Panamanian Seba's short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), a widely distributed, generalist, neotropical species. We have detected a remarkable individual and population-level diversity of MHC class I genes, with between seven and 22 alleles and a unique genotype in each individual. This diversity is comparable with that reported in passerine birds and, in both taxonomic groups, further variability has evolved through length polymorphisms. Our findings support the hypothesis that, for species with a geographically broader range, high MHC class I variability is particularly adaptive. Investigation of the details of the underlying adaptive processes and the role of the high MHC diversity in pathogen resistance are important next steps for a better understanding of the role of bats in viral evolution and as carriers of several deadly zoonotic viruses.

Experimental Infection of Pregnant Female Sheep with Zika Virus During Early Gestation								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	9					795	10.3390/v11090795				SEP 2019	2019	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a vertically and sexually transmissible virus resulting in severe congenital malformation. The goal of this study was to develop an ovine model of ZIKV infection. Between 28-35 days gestation (DG), four pregnant animals were infected with two doses of 6 x 10(6) PFU of ZIKV; four control animals received PBS. Animals were evaluated for 45 days (D) post-infection (PI) and necropsies were performed. Viral RNA was detected in infected ewe peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during the first week PI; however, all fluids and tissues were negative upon culture. Anti-ZIKV IgM (1:400) and neutralizing antibodies were detected in all infected animals. Clinical disease, virus, or ZIKV antibodies were not detected in control ewes. After two weeks PI, fetal loss occurred in two infected animals, and at necropsy, three infected animals had placental petechiation and ecchymosis and one had hydramnion. Fetal morphometrics revealed smaller cranial circumference to crown-rump length ratios (p < 0.001) and relative brain weights (p = 0.038) in fetuses of infected animals compared with control fetuses. Immunophenotyping indicated an increase in B cells (p = 0.012) in infected sheep. Additionally, in vitro experiments using both adult and fetal cell lines demonstrated that ovine cells are highly permissive to ZIKV infection. In conclusion, ZIKV infection of pregnant sheep results in a change in fetal growth and gestational outcomes.																					WOS:000487962400036	31470560

HPgV is transmitted via vertical, sexual, and blood-borne routes. Recently, the association of HPgV infection with the risk of lymphoma was reported. Here, we examined the prevalence of chronic HPgV infection in liver transplantation (LT) recipients and patients with hepatectomy and the influence of HPgV infection after LT on clinical and perioperative factors. We enrolled 313 LT recipients and 187 patients with hepatectomy who received care at the Kyusyu University Hospital between May 1997 and September 2017. Of the 313 recipients and 187 patients enrolled in this study, 44 recipients (14.1%) and 2 patients (1.1%) had HPgV viremia, respectively. There was no significant association between HPgV infection and LT outcomes. Interestingly, one recipient was infected with HPgV during the peritransplant period, which was likely transmitted via blood transfusion because HPgV RNA was detected from the blood bag transfused to the recipient during LT. We reviewed the available literature on the prevalence HPgV infections in other organ-transplanted patients and whether they impacted clinical outcomes. They also had the higher prevalence of HPgV infection, while it appears to be of low or no consequences. In addition, HPgV infection induced the upregulation of interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. LT recipients had higher HPgV viremia compared to patients with hepatectomy. Although HPgV infection was not associated with LT-related outcomes, it induced ISG expression in recipients.																					WOS:000479841800001	31350911

The full genome of the virus was determined for three strains, identifying the first hepacivirus-like flavivirus in birds. The virus, that we tentatively named duck hepacivirus-like virus (DuHV), possesses several unique molecular features, such as possession of the largest hepacivirus-like polyprotein gene and a Pegivirus A-like internal ribosome entry site. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic and sliding-window analyses indicated that DuHV is most closely related to, but highly divergent from, the known hepaciviruses. DuHV was detected in 69.7 % of 185 serum samples from four duck species and in 31 of 33 flocks from five provinces of China, reflecting a high prevalence in duck populations and a wide geographical distribution. The detection of DuHV in the same flock in November 2018 and April 2019 suggested that persistent infection can be established in the infected ducks.

Experimental modelling of hRSV disease by bovine RSV (bRSV) infection in calves provides an important tool for developing new strategies for prevention and treatment. Depending on the scientific hypothesis under investigation, this cognate host-virus model might have the disadvantage of using a highly related but not genetically identical virus. In this study, we aim to describe viral kinetics and (clinical) disease characteristics in calves inoculated with hRSV. Our results show that hRSV infects the upper and, to a lesser extent, the lower respiratory tract of calves. Infection causes upper airway clinical disease symptoms and neutrophilic infiltration of the lower airways. We conclude that a hRSV model in calves may aid future research involving distinct scientific questions related to hRSV disease in children.																					WOS:000474577400035	31300116

Nipah virus: a narrative review of viral characteristics and epidemiological determinants								PUBLIC HEALTH				173				97	104		10.1016/j.puhe.2019.05.019				AUG 2019	2019	Objectives: The objectives of this article are to highlight the properties of the Nipah virus (NiV) and discuss its epidemiological determinants.Study design: A review of conjectures, epidemiological and clinically related studies, and identification and discussion of preventive approaches is conducted.Methods: A review of the current literature is performed going through online search engines: PubMed and Google Scholar. The search strategy was focused on two main components first on the NiV ('Nipah' OR 'Nipah Virus') and subsequently on its epidemiology, including determinants and preventive measures ('Epidemiology/determinants' OR 'Epidemiology/prevention').Results: NiV infection is an emerging zoonotic infectious disease causing sporadic outbursts in many developing countries within Asia, Africa, and South America. Pteroid bats are the natural reservoirs, but human-to-human transmission is possible. Clinical course ranges from non-specific influenza-like symptoms to rapidly progressive respiratory and neurologic complications. Vector control has been challenging because of its widely distributed ecological niche. Currently, no definitive treatment protocols are available in humans, but profound breakthrough in vaccine technology and successful equine vaccines has shown the way for the development of NiV vaccine and immunization in the near future.Conclusions: The NiV poses a significant public health risk because of its intricate transmission cycle, unpredictable viral course, murky management protocol, and unavailability of vaccine. Complicated by emergence and subsequent reemergence, prevention and containment are the two most important public health promotion strategies. Early anticipation, intergovernmental preparedness and cooperation, and surveillance of zoonotic infections still remain the key to mitigate the risk. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health.

Multiple infections by viruses and bacteria increase disease severity. Previously, we reported that bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infection increases adherence of Pasteurella multocida to human respiratory and bovine kidney epithelial cells. To examine the interaction between the virus and bacteria in bovine respiratory cells, we generated respiratory epithelial cell lines from bovine trachea (bTEC), bronchus (bBEC), and lung (bLEC). Although all established cell lines were infected by BRSV and P. multocida susceptibility differed according to site of origin. The cells derived from the lower respiratory tract (bBEC and bLEC) were significantly more susceptible to BRSV than those derived from the upper respiratory tract (bTEC). Pre-infection of bBEC and bLEC with BRSV increased adherence of P. multocida; this was not the case for bTEC. These results indicate that BRSV may reproduce better in the lower respiratory tract and encourage adherence of bacteria. Thus, we identify one possible mechanism underlying severe pneumonia.																					WOS:000482247200010	31282382	
J	Thakur, Nazia; Bailey, Dalan								Advances in diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for Nipah virus								MICROBES AND INFECTION				21	7			278	286		10.1016/j.micinf.2019.02.002				AUG-SEP 2019	2019	Nipah virus is an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes severe and often fatal respiratory and neurological disease in humans. The virus was first discovered after an outbreak of encephalitis in pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore with subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh or India occurring almost annually. Due to the highly pathogenic nature of NiV, its pandemic potential, and the lack of licensed vaccines or therapeutics, there is a requirement for research and development into highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tools as well as antivirals and vaccines to help prevent and control future outbreak situations.

Nipah and Hendra Virus Glycoproteins Induce Comparable Homologous but Distinct Heterologous Fusion Phenotypes								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	13					e00577-19	10.1128/JVI.00577-19				JUL 2019	2019	Nipah and Hendra viruses (NiV and Hey) exhibit high lethality in humans and are biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) paramyxoviruses in the growing genus Henipavirus. The attachment (G) and fusion (F) envelope glycoproteins are both required for viral entry into cells and for cell-cell fusion, which is pathognomonic of henipaviral infections. Here, we compared the fusogenic capacities between homologous and heterologous pairs of NiV and HeV glycoproteins. Importantly, to accurately measure their fusogenic capacities, as these depend on glycoprotein cell surface expression (CSE) levels, we inserted identical extracellular tags to both fusion (FLAG tags) or both attachment (hemagglutinin [HA] tags) glycoproteins. Importantly, these tags were placed in extracellular sites where they did not affect glycoprotein expression or function. NiV and HeV glycoproteins induced comparable levels of homologous HEK293T cell-cell fusion. Surprisingly, however, while the heterologous NiV F/HeV G (NF/HG) combination yielded a hypofusogenic phenotype, the heterologous HeV F/NiV G (HF/NG) combination yielded a hyperfusogenic phenotype. Pseudotyped viral entry levels primarily corroborated the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein pairs analyzed. Furthermore, we constructed G and F chimeras that allowed us to map the overall regions in G and F that contributed to these hyperfusogenic or hypofusogenic phenotypes. Importantly, the fusogenic phenotypes of the glycoprotein combinations negatively correlated with the avidities of F-G interactions, supporting the F/G dissociation model of henipavirus-induced membrane fusion, even in the context of heterologous glycoprotein pairs.IMPORTANCE The NiV and HeV henipaviruses are BSL-4 pathogens transmitted from bats. NiV and HeV often lead to human death and animal diseases. The formation of multinucleated cells (syncytia) is a hallmark of henipaviral infections and is caused by fusion of cells coordinated by interactions of the viral attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins. We found via various assays that viral entry and syncytium formation depend on the viral origin of the glycoproteins, with HeV F and NiV G promoting higher membrane fusion levels than their counterparts. This is important knowledge, since both viruses use the same bat vector species and potential coinfections of these or subsequent hosts may alter the outcome of disease.

As such, they have been the subject of a large array of clinical, virological and eco-evolutionary studies. Many experiments have been conducted in vitro or on animal models to identify the mechanisms leading to pathogenesis in humans and to develop treatments of hantavirus diseases. Experimental research has also been dedicated to the understanding of the relationship between hantaviruses and their reservoirs. However, these studies remain too scarce considering the diversity of hantavirus/reservoir pairs identified, and the wide range of issues that need to be addressed. In this review, we present a synthesis of the experimental studies that have been conducted on hantaviruses and their reservoirs. We aim at summarizing the knowledge gathered from this research, and to emphasize the gaps that need to be filled. Despite the many difficulties encountered to carry hantavirus experiments, we advocate for the need of such studies in the future, at the interface of evolutionary ecology and virology. They are critical to address emerging areas of research, including hantavirus evolution and the epidemiological consequences of individual variation in infection outcomes.

Virome capture sequencing does not identify active viral infection in unicentric and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease								PLOS ONE				14	6					e0218660	10.1371/journal.pone.0218660				JUN 26 2019	2019	Castleman disease (CD) describes a spectrum of heterogeneous disorders defined by characteristic lymph node histopathology. Enlarged lymph nodes demonstrating CD histopathology can occur in isolation (unicentric CD; UCD) sometimes accompanied by mild symptoms, or at multiple sites (multicentric CD, MCD) with systemic inflammation and cytokine-driven multi-organ dysfunction. The discovery that Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus/human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 drives MCD in a subset of patients has led to the hypotheses that UCD and MCD patients with negative HHV-8 testing by conventional methods may represent false negatives, or that these cases are driven by another virus, known or unknown. To investigate these hypotheses, the virome capture sequencing for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) platform was employed to detect RNA transcripts from known and novel viruses in fresh frozen lymph node tissue from CD patients (12 UCD, 11 HHV-8-negative MCD [idiopathic MCD; iMCD], and two HHV-8-positive MCD) and related diseases (three T cell lymphoma and three Hodgkin lymphoma). This assay detected HHV-8 in both HHV-8-positive cases; however, HHV-8 was not found in clinically HHV-8-negative iMCD or UCD cases. Additionally, no novel viruses were discovered, and no single known virus was detected with apparent association to HHV-8-negative CD cases. Herpesviridae family members, notably including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), were detected in 7 out of 12 UCD and 5 of 11 iMCD cases with apparent correlations with markers of disease severity in iMCD. Analysis of a separate cohort of archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node tissue by In situ hybridization revealed significantly fewer EBV-positive cells in UCD and iMCD compared to tissue from HHV-8-positive MCD and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder. In an additional cohort, quantitative testing for EBV by PCR in peripheral blood during disease flare did not detect systemic EBV viremia, suggesting detection lymph node tissue is due to occult, local reactivation in UCD and iMCD. This study confirms that HHV-8 is not present in UCD and iMCD patients. Further, it fails to establish a clear association between any single virus, novel or known, and CD in HHV-8-negative cases. Given that distinct forms of CD exist with viral and non-viral etiological drivers, CD should be considered a group of distinct and separate diseases with heterogeneous causes worthy of further study.

To detect the presence of DENV in bats, a descriptive prospective study using a nonprobabilistic sampling was carried out; 286 bats in 12 sites were caught. Sample tissues of different animals were obtained; the RNA was obtained from tissues and a nested-RT-PCR was carried out and detected amplicons of 143 fragment of the NS5 gene were sequenced by the Sanger method. In nonhematophagous bats Carollia perspicillata and Phyllostomus discolor captured in Ayapel and San Carlos (Cordoba), respectively, an amplicon corresponding to NS5 was detected. The amplicons showed a high similarity with serotype-2 dengue virus (DENV-2). This is the first evidence of the DENV-2 genome in bats in from the Colombian Caribbean.

To date eleven different pegivirus species (Pegivirus A-K) have been described. However, little is known about the tissue tropism and replication of pegiviruses. In 2016, a so far unknown porcine pegivirus (PPgV, Pegivirus K) was described and persistent infection in the host, similar to human pegivirus, was reported. In this study, qRT-PCR, phylogenetic analyses and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were implemented to detect and quantify PPgV genome content in serum samples from domestic pigs from Europe and Asia, in tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples and wild boar serum samples from Germany. PPgV was detectable in 2.7% of investigated domestic pigs from Europe and China (viral genome load 2.4 x 10(2) to 2.0 x 10(6) PPgV copies/ml), while all wild boar samples were tested negative. Phylogenetic analyses revealed pairwise nucleotide identities >90% among PPgVs. Finally, PPgV was detected in liver, thymus and PBMCs by qRT-PCR and FISH, suggesting liver- and lymphotropism. Taken together, this study provides first insights into the tissue tropism of PPgV and shows its distribution and genetic variability in Europe and China.

Seasonal temperatures and hydrological conditions improve the prediction of West Nile virus infection rates in Culex mosquitoes and human case counts in New York and Connecticut								PLOS ONE				14	6					e0217854	10.1371/journal.pone.0217854				JUN 3 2019	2019	West Nile virus (WNV; Flaviviridae: Flavivirus) is a widely distributed arthropod-borne virus that has negatively affected human health and animal populations. WNV infection rates of mosquitoes and human cases have been shown to be correlated with climate. However, previous studies have been conducted at a variety of spatial and temporal scales, and the scale-dependence of these relationships has been understudied. We tested the hypothesis that climate variables are important to understand these relationships at all spatial scales. We analyzed the influence of climate on WNV infection rate of mosquitoes and number of human cases in New York and Connecticut using Random Forests, a machine learning technique. During model development, 66 climate-related variables based on temperature, precipitation and soil moisture were tested for predictive skill. We also included 20-21 non-climatic variables to account for known environmental effects (e.g., land cover and human population), surveillance related information (e.g., relative mosquito abundance), and to assess the potential explanatory power of other relevant factors (e.g., presence of wastewater treatment plants). Random forest models were used to identify the most important climate variables for explaining spatial-temporal variation in mosquito infection rates (abbreviated as MLE). The results of the cross-validation support our hypothesis that climate variables improve the predictive skill for MLE at county-and trap-scales and for human cases at the county-scale. Of the climate-related variables selected, mean minimum temperature from July-September was selected in all analyses, and soil moisture was selected for the mosquito county-scale analysis. Models demonstrated predictive skill, but still over-and under-estimated WNV MLE and numbers of human cases. Models at fine spatial scales had lower absolute errors but had greater errors relative to the mean infection rates.																					WOS:000469915700030	31158250

This study aimed to evaluate the overall prevalence of HGV infection in Chinese blood donors and analyse the potential risk of HGV infection through blood transfusion in China.MethodsWe performed a literature search in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Chinese BioMedical Literature Database (CBM) and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) up to October 2018 regarding the prevalence of HGV in Chinese blood donors. Eligibility assessment and data extraction were conducted independently by 2 researchers, and meta-analysis was performed to synthesize the data. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Cochran's Q test and quantified using the I-2 statistic. Subgroup analyses were performed to identify the possible sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed using both funnel plot and Egger's tests.ResultsA total of 102 studies with 67,348 blood donors published from 1996 to 2016 and covering 26 provinces or municipalities were included for further analyses. The pooled prevalence of HGV was 3.91% (95%CI: 3.18-4.71%) by enzyme immune assay/enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (EIA/ELISA) and 3.25% (95%CI: 2.35-4.26%) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of HGV may be significantly affected by region, province or municipality and potentially by the paid/voluntary status of the blood donors. No significant difference was found between plasma and full blood donation.ConclusionsThe prevalence of HGV in blood donors from China was similar to that in blood donors from many other countries and higher than that of some other hepatitis viruses, such as hepatitis B virus. The risk of transfusion-transmitted HGV still exists after routine blood donor screening, especially in those patients coinfected with other hepatitis viruses and/or HIV. On the basis of our study, we may suggest adding HGV screening for blood transfusions in mainland China in the future.																					WOS:000470117600003	31159757

Pathogenesis of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection in BALB/c Mice Differs Between Intratracheal and Intranasal Inoculation								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	6					508	10.3390/v11060508				JUN 2019	2019	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of severe lower respiratory tract disease requiring hospitalization in infants. There are no market-approved vaccines or antiviral agents available, but a growing number of vaccines and therapeutics are in (pre)clinical stages of development. Reliable animal models are crucial to evaluate new vaccine concepts, but in vivo RSV research is hampered by the lack of well-characterized animal models that faithfully mimic the pathogenesis of RSV infection in humans. Mice are frequently used in RSV infection and vaccination studies. However, differences in the use of mouse strains, RSV subtypes, and methodology often lead to divergent study outcomes. To our knowledge, a comparison between different RSV inoculation methods in mice has not been described in the literature, even though multiple methods are being used across different studies. In this study, we evaluated various pathological and immunological parameters in BALB/c mice after intratracheal or intranasal inoculation with RSV-A2. Our study reveals that intranasal inoculation induces robust pathology and inflammation, whereas this is not the case for intratracheal inoculation. As immunopathology is an important characteristic of RSV disease in infants, these data suggest that in mice intranasal inoculation is a more appropriate method to study RSV infection than intratracheal inoculation. These findings will contribute to the rational experimental design of future in vivo RSV experiments.																					WOS:000475308000026	31163619

As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. In addition, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta-peptide (A beta(42)), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies.

Its zoonotic nature, as well as high rate of human-to-human transmission, has led researchers worldwide to work toward understanding the different aspects of the NiV. We performed a codon usage analysis, based on publicly available nucleotide sequences of NiV and its host adaptation, along with other members of the Henipavirus genus in ten hosts. NiV genome encodes nine open reading frames; and overall, no significant bias in codon usage was observed. Aromaticity of proteins had no impact on codon usage. An analysis of preferred codons used by NiV and the tRNA pool in human cells indicated that NiV prefers codons from a suboptimal anticodon tRNA pool. We observed that codon usage by NiV is mainly constrained by compositional and selection pressures, not by mutational forces. Parameters that define NiV and host relatedness in terms of codon usage were analyzed, with a codon adaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and similarity index calculations; which indicated that, of all hosts analyzed, NiV was best adapted to African green monkeys. A comparative analysis based on the relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI) for host adaptation of NiV, Hendra virus (HeV), Cedar virus (CedV), and Hendra like Mojiang virus (MojV) revealed that except for dogs and ferrets, all evaluated hosts were more susceptible to HeV than NiV.

Up to date, no licensed vaccines are available to prevent severe hRSV-induced disease, and the generation of safe-effective vaccines has been a challenging task, requiring constant biomedical research aimed to overcome this ailment. Among the difficulties presented by the study of this pathogen, it arises the fact that there is no single animal model that resembles all aspects of the human pathology, which is due to the specificity that this pathogen has for the human host. Thus, for the study of hRSV, different animal models might be employed, depending on the goal of the study. Of all the existing models, the murine model has been the most frequent model of choice for biomedical studies worldwide and has been of great importance at contributing to the development and understanding of vaccines and therapies against hRSV. The most notable use of the murine model is that it is very useful as a first approach in the development of vaccines or therapies such as monoclonal antibodies, suggesting in this way the direction that research could have in other preclinical models that have higher maintenance costs and more complex requirements in its management. However, several additional different models for studying hRSV, such as other rodents, mustelids, ruminants, and non-human primates, have been explored, offering advantages over the murine model. In this review, we discuss the various applications of animal models to the study of hRSV-induced disease and the advantages and disadvantages of each model, highlighting the potential of each model to elucidate different features of the pathology caused by the hRSV infection.

In comparative genome-scale siRNA screens with wild-type-derived measles, mumps, and respiratory syncytial viruses in A549 cells, a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, we identified vesicular transport, RNA processing pathways, and translation as the top pathways required by all three viruses. As the top hit in the translation pathway, ABCE1, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporters, was chosen for further study. We found that ABCE1 supports replication of all three viruses, confirming its importance for viruses of both families. More detailed characterization revealed that ABCE1 is specifically required for efficient viral but not general cellular protein synthesis, indicating that paramyxoviral and pneumoviral mRNAs exploit specific translation mechanisms. In addition to providing a novel overview of cellular proteins and pathways that impact these important pathogens, this study highlights the role of ABCE1 as a host factor required for efficient paramyxovirus and pneumovirus translation.IMPORTANCE The Paramyxoviridae and Pneumoviridae families include important human and animal pathogens. To identify common host factors, we performed genome-scale siRNA screens with wild-type-derived measles, mumps, and respiratory syncytial viruses in the same cell line. A comparative bioinformatics analysis yielded different members of the coatomer complex I, translation factors ABCE1 and eIF3A, and several RNA binding proteins as cellular proteins with proviral activity for all three viruses. A more detailed characterization of ABCE1 revealed its essential role for viral protein synthesis. Taken together, these data sets provide new insight into the interactions between paramyxoviruses and pneumoviruses and host cell proteins and constitute a starting point for the development of broadly effective antivirals.

Among the antiviral effectors induced, Mx proteins of some species appear as key components of defense against influenza A viruses. It is expected that such an antiviral protein must display a platform dedicated to the recognition of said viruses. In an attempt to identify such platform in human MxA, an evolution-guided approach capitalizing on the antagonistic arms race between MxA and its viral targets and the genomic signature it left on primate genomes revealed that the surface-exposed so-called "loop L4", which protrudes from the compact structure of the MxA stalk, is a hotspot of recurrent positive selection. Since MxA is archetypic of Mx1 proteins in general, we reasoned that the L4 loop also functions as a recognition platform for influenza viruses in the Mx1 proteins of other species that had been exposed to the virus for ever. In this study, the anti-influenza activity of 5 distinct mammalian Mx1 proteins was measured by comparing the number of viral nucleoprotein-positive cells 7 h after infection in a sample of 100,000 cells expected to contain both Mx1-positive and Mx1-negative cell subpopulations. The systematic depletion (P < 0.001) of virus nucleoprotein-positive cells among equine, bubaline, porcine, and bovine Mx1-expressing cell populations compared with Mx-negative cells suggests a strong anti-influenza A activity. Looking for common anti-influenza signature elements in the sequence of these Mx proteins, we found that an aromatic residue at positions 561 or 562 in the L4 loop seems critical for the anti-influenza function and/or specificity of mammalian Mx1.

West Nile Virus Associations in Wild Mammals: An Update								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	5					459	10.3390/v11050459				MAY 2019	2019	Although West Nile virus (WNV) is generally thought to circulate among mosquitoes and birds, several historic and recent works providing evidence of WNV activity in wild mammals have been published. Indeed, a previous review tabulated evidence of WNV exposure in at least 100 mammalian species. Herein, we provide an update on WNV activity in wild and select other mammals that have been reported since the last major review article on this subject was published in early 2013. Of interest, new species, such as Hoffman's two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni), are now included in the growing list of wild mammals that have been naturally exposed to WNV. Furthermore, new instances of WNV viremia as well as severe disease presumably caused by this virus have been reported in wild mammals (e.g., the Virginia opossum [Didelphis virginiana]) from natural and semi-captive (e.g., zoological institution) settings. Regrettably, few recent challenge studies have been conducted on wild mammals, which would provide key information as to their potential role(s) in WNV cycles. Largely based on these recent findings, important future lines of research are recommended to assess which mammalian species are commonly exposed to WNV, which mammal species develop viremias sufficient for infecting mosquitoes, and which mammal species might be negatively affected by WNV infection at the species or population level.

J	Taklual, Wubet; Tang, Shixing; Yue, Wu								Effect of human pegivirus route of transmission on the genetic distribution of the virus: an institution based cross-sectional study								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				16						50	10.1186/s12985-019-1161-5				APR 25 2019	2019	IntroductionHuman pegivirus (HPgV), formally called GB virus C (GBV-C), is a member of the pegivirus genus in Flaviviridae family. High prevalence of HPgV infection is seen among sex workers, blood transfusion recipients and intravenous drug users (IDUs). So far, there are seven genotypes and many subtypes identified in different countries. The predominant genotype in Asia including China is genotype 3, although genotype 7 has been reported recently in China. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the transmission routes of HPgV infection on the genotype distribution of the virus, to determine the prevalence rate, and identify the dominant genotype among men who have sex with men (MSM) and IDUs co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) in Guangzhou, China.MethodsA total of 131 MSM and 70 IDUs co-infected with HIV-1 were randomly selected in Guangdong Dermatology Hospital. HPgV RNA was detected by nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers. The PCR products were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed by using MEGA6.06 version software to determine the genotypes. Chi-square and Fisher exact test were implemented for comparing the proportion between different variables.ResultsThe prevalence of HPgV infection was 32.9% among IDUs and 18.3% in MSM with a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p=0.02). In IDU group, 82.6% infected with genotype 3 and the rest (17.4%) were categorized to genotype 7. Similarly, in MSM group, 83.3% belonged to genotype 3, and the remaining 16.7% were classified as sub-genotype 2a and 2b.ConclusionIn Guangzhou, China, the prevalence rate of HPgV infection in IDUs was higher than MSM. The dominant genotype in the two groups was genotype 3. Our results indicated that routes of transmission did not affect the genotype distribution but did affect the prevalence rate of HPgV infection.																					WOS:000466106300001	31023332

D.; Mathews, Neil								State of the Art in Respiratory Syncytial Virus Drug Discovery and Development								JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY				62	7			3206	3227		10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01361				APR 11 2019	2019	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a globally prevalent viral infection with limited treatment options which hospitalizes millions each year. Treatment options have been limited to palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody, approved for prophylaxis in high-risk infants and ribavirin with very limited efficacy and significant safety concerns. This Perspective surveys the range of direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs) that target key steps in the viral life cycle. A number of approaches to DAAs have produced landmark clinical studies over the past few years, notably in fusion and nucleoside inhibitors, and an update of the clinical status of these compounds is provided. Non-nucleoside inhibitors of replication are reviewed in addition to inhibitors of other mechanisms, notably the RSV N and G proteins. This article will provide an informative perspective of the current status of drug discovery targeted at providing an effective therapy for RSV infection.

The first symptoms of infection are similar to a cold and include mainly fever, headache and general fatigue. Then comes brain dysfunction and acute neurological symptoms, and ultimately - in most cases - death. Lyssaviruses are spread mainly through direct contact with the carrier constituting the viral reservoir. The gold standard in diagnostics is the method of direct immunofluorescence, by means of which viral antigens are detected, mainly in the saliva of a patient. Currently, rabies treatment is an experimental therapy according to the Milwaukee protocol.																					WOS:000472989000004

A review of the monkeypox virus and a recent outbreak of skin rash disease in Nigeria								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY				91	4			533	540		10.1002/jmv.25348				APR 2019	2019	Since the eradication of smallpox approximately 39 years ago, monkeypox virus remains the most pathogenic poxvirus, being mainly restricted to Central and West Africa. Before 1970, there were no reports of human monkeypox in Nigeria, while between 1971 and 1978 there were three cases, with none having been reported thereafter. However, in September 2017, a case of contagious skin rash disease, typical of monkeypox, was observed in an 11-year-old boy from the southern part of the country and confirmed to be associated with the monkeypox virus. This large outbreak consisted of 262 suspected, 115 confirmed cases, and 7 mortalities across 26 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. The aim of this manuscript is to provide an updated, comprehensive, and timely review of monkeypox, an important emerging infection in Nigeria. Monkeypox is now a major threat to global health security, requiring an urgent multidisciplinary approach involving veterinarians, physicians, virologists, and public health experts to fast-track the development of diagnostic assays, vaccines, antivirals, and other control strategies.

To date, there is no documentation with respect to the presence of PPgVs in domestic pigs in China. Herein, we attempted to determine the presence and prevalence of PPgV in China and its genetic characterization. In this study, 469 sera were tested and 34 (7.25%) were positive for PPgV. An ascending trend of the positive rate for PPgV was observed from suckling piglets (1.61%) to nursing piglets (1.85%), finishing pigs (6.56%), and sows (11.34%). The complete genome sequence of a representative strain of PPgV, PPgV_GDCH2017, and the complete E2 gene of 17 PPgV isolates discovered in this study was determined. Sequence analysis indicated that PPgV_GDCH2017 was highly related to other PPgVs with nucleotide and amino acid identitiesranging from 87.3 to 97.4% and 94.6-99.3%, respectively, in the complete coding region. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the PPgV_GDCH2017 discovered in this study was closely related to the PPgVs from the USA and clustered in the same genus with pegiviruses from other hosts. The topology of the phylogenetic tree based on the complete E2 gene was consistent with that based on the complete genome of PPgV. Further studies on pathogenicity and pathogenesis of PPgVs are needed.																					WOS:000464910200015	30600430	
J	Manuel Marti, Jose								Recentrifuge: Robust comparative analysis and contamination removal for metagenomics								PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY				15	4					e1006967	10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006967				APR 2019	2019	Metagenomic sequencing is becoming widespread in biomedical and environmental research, and the pace is increasing even more thanks to nanopore sequencing. With a rising number of samples and data per sample, the challenge of efficiently comparing results within a specimen and between specimens arises. Reagents, laboratory, and host related contaminants complicate such analysis. Contamination is particularly critical in low microbial biomass body sites and environments, where it can comprise most of a sample if not all. Recentrifuge implements a robust method for the removal of negative-control and crossover taxa from the rest of samples. With Recentrifuge, researchers can analyze results from taxonomic classifiers using interactive charts with emphasis on the confidence level of the classifications. In addition to contamination-subtracted samples, Recentrifuge provides shared and exclusive taxa per sample, thus enabling robust contamination removal and comparative analysis in environmental and clinical metagenomics. Regarding the first area, Recentrifuge's novel approach has already demonstrated its benefits showing that microbiomes of Arctic and Antarctic solar panels display similar taxonomic profiles. In the clinical field, to confirm Recentrifuge's ability to analyze complex metagenomes, we challenged it with data coming from a metagenomic investigation of RNA in plasma that suffered from critical contamination to the point of preventing any positive conclusion. Recentrifuge provided results that yielded new biological insight into the problem, supporting the growing evidence of a blood microbiota even in healthy individuals, mostly translocated from the gut, the oral cavity, and the genitourinary tract. We also developed a synthetic dataset carefully designed to rate the robust contamination removal algorithm, which demonstrated a significant improvement in specificity while retaining a high sensitivity even in the presence of cross-contaminants. Recentrifuge's official website is www.recentrifuge.org. The data and source code are anonymously and freely available on GitHub and PyPI. The computing code is licensed under the AGPLv3. The Recentrifuge Wiki is the most extensive and continually-updated source of documentation for Recentrifuge, covering installation, use cases, testing, and other useful topics.Author summary Whether in a clinical or environmental sample, metagenomics can reveal what microorganisms exist and what they do. It is indeed a powerful tool for the study of microbial communities which requires equally powerful methods of analysis. Current challenges in the analysis of metagenomic data include the comparative study of samples, the degree of uncertainty in the results, and the removal of contamination. The scarcer the microbes are in an environment, the more essential it is to have solutions to these issues. Examples of sites with few microbes are not only habitats with low levels of nutrients, but also many body tissues and fluids. Recentrifuge's novel approach combines statistical, mathematical and computational methods to tackle those challenges with efficiency and robustness: it seamlessly removes diverse contamination, provides a confidence level for every result, and unveils the generalities and specificities in the metagenomic samples.

The natural history of HPgV-1 infection is still unclear, however, the main route of viral transmission seems to be the parenteral one. The detection of HPgV-1 viremia in blood donors without parenteral exposure demonstrates that other routes of HPgV-1 transmission might also exist. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA and circulating genotypes among blood donors from a intra-hospital Hemotherapy Service localized in the Santa Maria city, central part of the Rio Grande do Sul State in the extreme South of Brazil.Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 373 volunteer blood donors and tested for the presence of HPgV-1 RNA. All positive for RNA samples were submitted to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.Results: The prevalence of the HPgV-1 RNA was 5.9% (22/373). The performed phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a predominant detection of genotype 2 with its both subgenotype forms (95.5% of all isolates i.e 54.5% belonging to subgenotype 2 A and 40.9% belonging to subgenotype 2B). Only one sequence was classified as genotype 3 (1/22, 4.5%).Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the circulation pattern and genotypes of HPgV-1 among volunteer blood donors of South Brazil, and adds to the global knowledge of the natural history and possible transmission routes of this viral agent with putative impact on the area of hemotherapy.

Role of Type I Interferon (IFN) in the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Immune Response and Disease Severity								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				10						566	10.3389/fimmu.2019.00566				MAR 26 2019	2019	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease in children <2 years of age. Increased morbidity and mortality have been reported in high-risk patients, such as premature infants, patients with cardiac disease, and severely immune compromised patients. Severe disease is associated with the virulence of the virus as well as host factors specifically including the innate immune response. The role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the response to RSV infection is important in regulating the rate of virus clearance and in directing the character of the immune response, which is normally associated with protection and less severe disease. Two RSV non-structural proteins, NS1 and NS2, as well as the envelope G glycoprotein are known to suppress type I IFN production and a robust type I IFN response to RSV does not occur in human infants or neonatal mouse models of RSV infection. Additionally, presence of type I IFNs are associated with mild symptoms in infants and administration of IFN-alpha prior to infection of neonatal mice with RSV reduces immunopathology. This evidence has driven RSV prophylaxis and therapeutic efforts to consider strategies for enhancing type I IFN production.																					WOS:000462539400001	30972063

Contribution of Cytokines to Tissue Damage During Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				10						452	10.3389/fimmu.2019.00452				MAR 18 2019	2019	The human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) remains one of the leading pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in children younger than 2 years old, worldwide. Hospitalizations during the winter season due to hRSV-induced bronchiolitis and pneumonia increase every year. Despite this, there are no available vaccines to mitigate the health and economic burden caused by hRSV infection. The pathology caused by hRSV induces significant damage to the pulmonary epithelium, due to an excessive inflammatory response at the airways. Cytokines are considered essential players for the establishment and modulation of the immune and inflammatory responses, which can either be beneficial or harmful for the host. The deleterious effect observed upon hRSV infection is mainly due to tissue damage caused by immune cells recruited to the site of infection. This cellular recruitment takes place due to an altered profile of cytokines secreted by epithelial cells. As a result of inflammatory cell recruitment, the amounts of cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-10, and CCL5 are further increased, while IL-10 and IFN-gamma are decreased. However, additional studies are required to elicit the mediators directly associated with hRSV damage entirely. In addition to the detrimental induction of inflammatory mediators in the respiratory tract caused by hRSV, reports indicating alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) have been published. Indeed, elevated levels of IL-6, IL-8 (CXCL8), CCL2, and CCL4 have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with severe bronchiolitis and hRSV-associated encephalopathy. In this review article, we provide an in-depth analysis of the role of cytokines secreted upon hRSV infection and their potentially harmful contribution to tissue damage of the respiratory tract and the CNS.

Enhanced Autophagy Contributes to Reduced Viral Infection in Black Flying Fox Cells								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	3					260	10.3390/v11030260				MAR 14 2019	2019	Bats are increasingly implicated as hosts of highly pathogenic viruses. The underlying virus-host interactions and cellular mechanisms that promote co-existence remain ill-defined, but physiological traits such as flight and longevity are proposed to drive these adaptations. Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process that regulates ageing, metabolism, and intrinsic immune defense. We quantified basal and stimulated autophagic responses in black flying fox cells, and demonstrated that although black flying fox cells are susceptible to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection, viral replication is dampened in these bat cells. Black flying fox cells tolerated prolonged ABLV infection with less cell death relative to comparable human cells, suggesting post-entry mechanisms interference with virus replication. An elevated basal autophagic level was observed and autophagy was induced in response to high virus doses. Pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway reduced virus replication, indicating autophagy acts as an anti-viral mechanism. Enhancement of basal and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells connects related reports that long-lived species possess homeostatic processes that dampen oxidative stress and macromolecule damage. Exemplifying the potential that evolved cellular homeostatic adaptations like autophagy may secondarily act as anti-viral mechanisms, enabling bats to serve as natural hosts to an assortment of pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, our data suggest autophagy-inducing drugs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for combating lyssavirus infection.																					WOS:000464392300003	30875748

However, the lack of bat specific reagents, in particular antibodies, has limited our knowledge of bat's immunity. Here, we report a panel of cross-reactive antibodies against MHC-II, NK1.1, CD3, CD21, CD27, and immunoglobulin (Ig), that allows flow cytometry analysis of B, T and NK cell populations in two different fruit-eating bat species namely, Pteropus alecto and E. spelaea. Results confirmed predominance of T cells in the spleen and blood of bats, as previously reported by us. However, the percentages of B cells in bone marrow and NK cells in spleen varied greatly between wild caught P. alecto bats and E. spelaea colony bats, which may reflect inherent differences of their immune system or different immune status. Other features of bat B cells were investigated. A significant increase in slg(+) B cell population was observed in the spleen and blood from LPS-injected bats but not from poly I:C-injected bats, supporting T-independent polyclonal B cell activation by LPS. Furthermore, using an in vitro calcium release assay, P. alecto B cells exhibited significant calcium release upon cross-linking of their B cell receptor. Together, this work contributes to improve our knowledge of bat adaptive immunity in particular B cells.																					WOS:000461136700001	30930908

Bat Research Networks and Viral Surveillance: Gaps and Opportunities in Western Asia								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	3					240	10.3390/v11030240				MAR 10 2019	2019	Bat research networks and viral surveillance are assumed to be at odds due to seemingly conflicting research priorities. Yet human threats that contribute to declines in bat populations globally also lead to increased transmission and spread of bat-associated viruses, which may pose a threat to global health and food security. In this review, we discuss the importance of and opportunities for multidisciplinary collaborations between bat research networks and infectious disease experts to tackle shared threats that jeopardize bat conservation as well as human and animal health. Moreover, we assess research effort on bats and bat-associated viruses globally, and demonstrate that Western Asia has limited published research and represents a gap for coordinated bat research. The lack of bat research in Western Asia severely limits our capacity to identify and mitigate region-specific threats to bat populations and detect interactions between bats and incidental hosts that promote virus spillover. We detail a regional initiative to establish the first bat research network in Western Asia (i.e., the Western Asia Bat Research Network, WAB-Net), with the aim of integrating ecological research on bats with virus surveillance to find "win-win" solutions that promote bat conservation and safeguard public and animal health across the region.

J	Fagre, Anna C.; Kading, Rebekah C.								Can Bats Serve as Reservoirs for Arboviruses?								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	3					215	10.3390/v11030215				MAR 3 2019	2019	Bats are known to harbor and transmit many emerging and re-emerging viruses, many of which are extremely pathogenic in humans but do not cause overt pathology in their bat reservoir hosts: henipaviruses (Nipah and Hendra), filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg), and coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). Direct transmission cycles are often implicated in these outbreaks, with virus shed in bat feces, urine, and saliva. An additional mode of virus transmission between bats and humans requiring further exploration is the spread of disease via arthropod vectors. Despite the shared ecological niches that bats fill with many hematophagous arthropods (e.g., mosquitoes, ticks, biting midges, etc.) known to play a role in the transmission of medically important arboviruses, knowledge surrounding the potential for bats to act as reservoirs for arboviruses is limited. To this end, a comprehensive literature review was undertaken examining the current understanding and potential for bats to act as reservoirs for viruses transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods. Serosurveillance and viral isolation from either free-ranging or captive bats are described in relation to four arboviral groups (Bunyavirales, Flaviviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae). Further, ecological associations between bats and hematophagous viral vectors are characterized (e.g., bat bloodmeals in mosquitoes, ingestion of mosquitoes by bats, etc). Lastly, knowledge gaps related to hematophagous ectoparasites (bat bugs and bed bugs (Cimicidae) and bat flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae)), in addition to future directions for characterization of bat-vector-virus relationships are described.

Functional Interplay between RNA Viruses and Non-Coding RNA in Mammals								NON-CODING RNA				5	1					7	10.3390/ncrna5010007				MAR 2019	2019	Exploring virus-host interactions is key to understand mechanisms regulating the viral replicative cycle and any pathological outcomes associated with infection. Whereas interactions at the protein level are well explored, RNA interactions are less so. Novel sequencing methodologies have helped uncover the importance of RNA-protein and RNA-RNA interactions during infection. In addition to messenger RNAs (mRNAs), mammalian cells express a great number of regulatory non-coding RNAs, some of which are crucial for regulation of the immune system whereas others are utilized by viruses. It is thus becoming increasingly clear that RNA interactions play important roles for both sides in the arms race between virus and host. With the emerging field of RNA therapeutics, such interactions are promising antiviral targets. In this review, we discuss direct and indirect RNA interactions occurring between RNA viruses or retroviruses and host non-coding transcripts upon infection. In addition, we review RNA virus derived non-coding RNAs affecting immunological and metabolic pathways of the host cell typically to provide an advantage to the virus. The relatively few known examples of virus-host RNA interactions suggest that many more await discovery.																					WOS:000572578800001	30646609

The field observations have shown that H9N2 viruses circulate and naturally mix with other pathogens and these simultaneous infections can exacerbate disease. To avoid an incorrect virus characterization, due to co-infection, isolates were purified by in vitro plaque assays. Two plaque purified G1-H9N2 clones, selected on different cell types, named MDCK-and CEF-clone in regards to the cell culture used, were studied in vivo, revealing two different virulence phenotypes. Subsequently, the underlying mechanisms were studied. Specifically, the phenotypical outcome of SPF bird infection by the two clones resulted in completely different clinical outcomes. These differences in clinical outcome were used to study the factors behind this output in more detail. Further studies demonstrated that the more severe disease outcome associated with the MDCK-clone involves a strong induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a lack of type I interferon production, whereas the mild disease outcome associated with the CEF-clone is related to a greater antiviral cytokine response. The immunosuppressive effect of the MDCK-clone on splenocytes was further demonstrated via ChIFN-gamma lack production after ex vivo mitogenic stimulation. Genome sequencing of the two clones identified only four amino acid differences including three in the HA sequence (HA-E198A, HA-R234L, HA-E502D-H9 numbering) and one in the NA sequence (NA-V33M). In the present study, valuable insights on the mechanisms responsible for AI pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of H9N2 infections in chicken were obtained while highlighting the impact of the cells viruses are grown on their virulence.

In this work we describe the design of dual-targeting peptides composed of peptide domains of E2 and E1 envelope proteins from Human Pegivirus with the aim of targeting both the loop region and the fusion peptide domains of HIV-1 gp41. In a previous work, we described the inhibitory role of a highly conserved fragment of the E1 protein (domain 139-156) which interacts with the HIV-1 fusion peptide at the membrane level. Here, two different dual-targeting peptides, where this E1 peptide is located on the N- or the C-terminus respectively, have been chemically synthesized and their antiviral activities have been evaluated with HIV pseudotyped viruses from different clades. The study of the functional behaviour of peptides in a membranous environment attending to the peptide recognition of the target sites on gp41, the peptide conformation as well as the peptide affinity to the membrane, demonstrate that antiviral activity of the dual-targeting peptides is directly related to the peptide affinity and its subsequent assembly into the model membrane. The overall results point out to the necessity that fusion inhibitor peptides that specifically interfere with the N-terminal region of gp41 are embedded within the membrane in order to properly interact with their viral target.

CYTOKINE				115				13	23		10.1016/j.cyto.2018.12.008				MAR 2019	2019	Disease fatality associated with Ebola, SARS-CoV and dengue infections in humans is attributed to a cytokine storm that is triggered by excessive pro-inflammatory responses. Interleukin (IL)-6 acts as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory reactivity by initiating trans- and classical-signaling, respectively. Hence, IL-6 is assumed to provide a target for a broad range of antiviral agents. Available immunosuppressive antivirals are directed to control an often exaggerated pro-inflammatory response that gives rise to complex clinical conditions such as lymphocytopenia. It is known that IL-6, via its soluble receptor (sIL-6R), initiates a pro-inflammatory response while an anti-inflammatory response is triggered by the membrane-bound IL-6 receptor (IL-6R). Future antivirals should thus aim to target the mechanism that regulates switching between IL-6 trans- and classical signaling. In this review, we propose that the tumour necrosis factor-a converting enzyme ADAM-17 could be the master molecule involved in regulating IL-6 class switching and through this in controlling pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery that would regulate host reactivity to infection and thereby limit or prevent fatal outcomes.

Vaccine Development for Nipah Virus Infection in Pigs								FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				6						16	10.3389/fvets.2019.00016				FEB 4 2019	2019	Nipah virus (NiV) causes a severe and often fatal neurological disease in humans. Whilst fruit bats are considered the natural reservoir, NiV also infects pigs and may cause an unapparent or mild disease. Direct pig-to-human transmission was responsible for the first and still most devastating NiV outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-99, with nearly 300 human cases and over 100 fatalities. Pigs can therefore play a key role in the epidemiology of NiV by acting as an "amplifying" host. The outbreak in Singapore ended with the prohibition of pig imports from Malaysia and the Malaysian outbreak was ended by culling 45% of the country's pig population with costs exceeding US$500 million. Despite the importance of NiV as an emerging disease with the potential for pandemic, no vaccines, or therapeutics are currently approved for human or livestock use. In this mini-review, we will discuss current knowledge of NiV infection in pigs; our ongoing work to develop a NiV vaccine for use in pigs; and the pig as a model to support human vaccine development.

Indeed, most viruses can also be transmitted through direct contact and droplets. Therefore, the importance of the airborne route in a clinical context is difficult to determine. The aim of this study was to design a chamber system to study the airborne transmission of viruses between ferrets. Methods: A system composed of three chambers connected in series, each one housing one ferret and preventing direct contact, was designed. The chambers were designed to house the ferrets for several days and to study the transmission of viruses from an infected (index) ferret to two naive ferrets via aerosols and droplets or aerosols only. A particle separator was designed that can be used to modulate the size of the particles traveling between the chambers. The chamber system was validated using standard dust as well as with ferrets infected with influenza A virus. Conclusions: The 50% efficiency cut-off of the separator could be modulated between a 5-mu m and an 8-mu m aerodynamic diameter. In the described setup, influenza A virus was transmitted through the aerosol route in two out of three experiments, and through aerosols and droplets in all three experiments.

Diverse RNA viruses of arthropod origin in the blood of fruit bats suggest a link between bat and arthropod viromes								VIROLOGY				528				64	72		10.1016/j.virol.2018.12.009				FEB 2019	2019	Bats host diverse viruses due to their unique ecology, behavior, and immunology. However, the role of other organisms with which bats interact in nature is understudied as a contributor to bat viral diversity. We discovered five viruses in the blood of fruit bats (Hypsigrtathus monstrosus) from the Republic of Congo. Of these five viruses, four have phylogenetic and genomic features suggesting an arthropod origin (a dicistrovirus, a nodavirus, and two tombus-like viruses), while the fifth (a hepadnavirus) is clearly of mammalian origin. We also report the parallel discovery of related tombus-like viruses in fig wasps and primitive crane flies from bat habitats, as well as high infection rates of bats with haemosporidian parasites (Hepatocystis sp.). These findings suggest transmission between arthropods and bats, perhaps through ingestion or hyperparasitism (viral infection of bat parasites). Some "bat-associated" viruses may be epidemiologically linked to bats through their ecological associations with invertebrates.																					WOS:000459526400008	30576861

In this study, we performed virus discovery on serum samples collected from 84 wild lemurs and identified viral sequence fragments from 4 novel viruses within the family Flaviviridae, including members of the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus. The sifaka hepacivirus (SifHV, two genotypes) and pegivirus (SifPgV, two genotypes) were discovered in the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema), while other pegiviral fragments were detected in samples from the indri (Indri indri, IndPgV) and the weasel sportive lemur (Lepilemur mustelinus, LepPgV). Although data are preliminary, each viral species appeared host species-specific and frequent infection was detected (18 of 84 individuals were positive for at least one virus). The complete coding sequence and partial 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) were obtained for SifHV and its genomic organization was consistent with that of other hepaciviruses, with one unique polyprotein and highly structured UTRs. Phylogenetic analyses showed the SifHV belonged to a clade that includes several viral species identified in rodents from Asia and North America, while SifPgV and IndPgV were more closely related to pegiviral species A and C, that include viruses found in humans as well as New- and Old-World monkeys. Our results support the current proposed model of virus-host co-divergence with frequent occurrence of cross-species transmission for these genera and highlight how the discovery of more members of the Flaviviridae can help clarify the ecology and evolutionary history of these viruses. Furthermore, this knowledge is important for conservation and captive management of lemurs.																					WOS:000458284300016	30460488

Molecular aspects of Rift Valley fever virus and the emergence of reassortants								VIRUS GENES				55	1			1	11		10.1007/s11262-018-1611-y				FEB 2019	2019	Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is a mosquito-transmitted pathogen endemic to sub-Saharan Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. RVFV is a threat to both animal and human health and has costly economic consequences mainly related to livestock production and trade. Competent hosts and vectors for RVFV are widespread, existing outside of endemic countries including the USA. Thus, the possibility of RVFV spreading to the USA or other countries worldwide is of significant concern. RVFV (genus Phlebovirus) is comprised of an enveloped virion containing a three-segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome that is able to undergo genetic reassortment. Reassortment has the potential to produce viruses that are more pathogenic, easily transmissible, and that have wider vector or host range. This is especially concerning because of the wide use of live attenuated vaccine strains throughout endemic countries. This review focuses on the molecular aspects of RVFV, genetic diversity of RVFV strains, and RVFV reassortment.																					WOS:000458271300001	30426314

However, the technical limitations inherent in these systems have constrained efforts to more fully understand such interactions, leading to a search for alternative in vitro systems that accurately recreate in vivo physiology in order to advance the study of viral pathogenesis. Over the last decade, there have been significant technological advances that have allowed researchers to more accurately model the host environment when modeling viral pathogenesis in vitro, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), adult stem-cell-derived organoid culture systems and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Such technological breakthroughs have ushered in a new era in the field of viral pathogenesis, where previously challenging questions have begun to be tackled. These include genome-wide analysis of host-virus crosstalk, identification of host factors critical for viral pathogenesis, and the study of viral pathogens that previously lacked a suitable platform, e.g., noroviruses, rotaviruses, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and Zika virus. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in the study of viral pathogenesis and host-virus crosstalk arising from the use of iPSC, organoid, and CRISPR/Cas9 technologies.

Perinatal infection can cause severe neurological complications, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and in adults there is an association with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). ZIKV is transmitted to humans by Aedes sp. mosquitoes, yet little is known about its enzootic cycle in which transmission is thought to occur between arboreal Aedes sp. mosquitos and non-human primates. In the 1950s and 60s, several bat species were shown to be naturally and experimentally susceptible to ZIKV with acute viremia and seroconversion, and some developed neurological disease with viral antigen detected in the brain. Because of ZIKV emergence in the Americas, we sought to determine susceptibility of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis), one of the most common bats in the New World. Bats were inoculated with ZIKV PRVABC59 but did not show signs of disease. Bats held to 28 days post-inoculation (PI) had detectable antibody by ELISA and viral RNA was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, saliva and urine in some of the bats. Immunoreactivity using polyclonal anti-ZIKV antibody was detected in testes, brain, lung and salivary glands plus scrotal skin. Tropism for mononuclear cells, including macrophages/microglia and fibroblasts, was seen in the aforementioned organs in addition to testicular Leydig cells. The virus likely localized to the brain via infection of Iba1(+) macrophage/microglial cells. Jamaican fruit bats, therefore, may be a useful animal model for the study of ZIKV infection. This work also raises the possibility that bats may have a role in Zika virus ecology in endemic regions, and that ZIKV may pose a wildlife disease threat to bat populations.Author summary The rapid spread of Zika virus through a naive population in the Americas resulted in novel and severe disease manifestations, including fetal and neonatal microcephaly, and GBS. These disease complications make understanding the pathology and ecology of ZIKV a priority. Captive Jamaican fruit bats were challenged with ZIKV to determine their susceptibility, to assess whether bats may play a role in virus ecology, and if they might serve as an animal model to better understand ZIKV pathophysiology. The bats became acutely infected and mounted an antibody response. Three terminally euthanized inoculated bats had antibody titers of 3200, 28 days PI. Evidence of virus replication and associated pathologies were found in the brain, testes, lungs and salivary glands of some of the inoculated bats. The virus showed predilection for mononuclear cells, including resident Iba1(+) macrophage/microglial cells, and Leydig cells. With no discernible disruption to the blood brain barrier nor distribution of viral antigen indicative of circumeventricular neuroinvasion, microglia cells may be a possible route of entry of ZIKV into brains of bats. Further investigations are needed to determine the mechanisms of neuroinvasion of ZIKV in bats, further determine feasibility of bats as an alternative animal-model for congenital Zika syndrome, and what role bats might play in ZIKV viral ecology.

It is maintained in nature through both urban and sylvatic cycles, involving mosquito vectors and human or vertebrate animal hosts. Although CHIKV was first isolated in 1953, its pathogenesis was only more extensively studied after its re-emergence in 2004. The unexpected spread of CHIKV to novel tropical and non-tropical areas, in some instances driven by newly competent vectors, evidenced the vulnerability of new territories to this infectious agent and its associated diseases. The comprehension of the exact CHIKV target cells and organs, mechanisms of pathogenesis, and spectrum of both competitive vectors and animal hosts is pivotal for the design of effective therapeutic strategies, vector control measures, and eradication actions.

The seroprevalence value of 40.43% (74/183, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 33.37-47.49) detected in our study using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (cELISA) proves a considerable level of Flavivirus exposition of these animals. Among the 74 cELISA-positive sera, seroneutralization (SN) test showed that 24 sera resulted positive for Usutu virus with an overall prevalence of 13.11% (24/183) (95% CI 8.27-17.95), but none of cELISA-positive samples resulted positive for West Nile virus. Data analysis showed a significant difference of cELISA seropositivity risk factors in case of presence of farm animals in contact with hunting dogs and for dogs living in a rural environment but not for gender, age, management, hunting season, and hunting abroad. A RT-PCR assay was performed to detect the Flavivirus RNA, but none of the blood samples tested positive. This study documents the first report regarding the circulation of Flavivirus in hunting dog in Southern Italy and suggests the dog as an interesting target to monitor Flavivirus circulation.

Inter-human transmission of monkeypox virus, although limited, drives outbreaks, particularly in household and health-care settings. But the available evidence suggests that without repeated zoonotic introductions, human infections would eventually cease to occur. Therefore, interrupting virus transmission from animals to humans is key to combating this disease. Areas covered: Herein we review laboratory and field studies examining the susceptibility of various animal taxa to monkeypox virus infection, and note the competence of various species to serve as reservoirs or transmission hosts. In addition, we discuss early socio-ecologic theories of monkeypox virus transmission in rural settings and review current modes of ecologic investigation - including ecologic niche modeling, and ecologic sampling - in light of their potential to identify specific animal species and features of the environment that are associated with heightened risk for human disease. Expert opinion: The role of disease ecology and scientific research in ongoing disease prevention efforts should be reinforced, particularly for wildlife-associated zoonoses such as monkeypox. Such efforts alongside those aimed at nurturing 'One Health' collaborations may ultimately hold the greatest promise for reducing human infections with this pathogen.

Its genome has a length of 9.6 kb and encodes a single polyprotein flanked by two untranslated regions. HCV can cause liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, and approximately 2% of the world's population is chronically infected. The investigation of pathogenesis is complicated due to the lack of an animal model. The origin of this virus remains unclear, but in the last few years, relatives of HCV were initially identified in dogs and later in horses, rodents, bats and Old World monkeys. Non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV), which infects dogs and horses, is the closest relative to HCV. We established a pan-reactive panHepaci-RT-qPCR assay, which is able to detect human HCV as well as equine NPHV, and additionally, an equine-specific equHepaci-RT-qPCR for confirmation of positive results. Serum samples from 1158 clinically inconspicuous horses from Germany and several samples from other mammalian species were screened. We found 2.4% of the horses positive for hepacivirus RNA, and furthermore, the panHepaci-RT-qPCR assay also detected a hepacivirus in a donkey from Egypt. This virus had only 78% sequence identity in the E2 gene when compared to other known NPHVs. The established method could be useful for screening purposes, since it is likely that related hepaciviruses also occur in other species.																					WOS:000458284300006	30361815	
J	Smallcombe, Carrie C.; Linfield, Debra T.; Harford, Terri J.; Bokun, Vladimir; Ivanov, Andrei I.; Piedimonte, Giovanni; Rezaee, Fariba								Disruption of the airway epithelial barrier in a murine model of respiratory syncytial virus infection								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY				316	2			L358	L368		10.1152/ajplung.00345.2018				FEB 2019	2019	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of hospitalization for infants and young children worldwide. RSV is known to infect epithelial cells and increase the permeability of model airway epithelial monolayers in vitro. We hypothesized that RSV infection also induces airway barrier dysfunction in vivo. C57BL/6 mice were intranasally inoculated with RSV, and on day 4 post-inoculation were examined for viral replication, lung inflammation, and barrier integrity as well as the structure and molecular composition of epithelial junctions. In parallel, primary mouse tracheal epithelial cells (mTEC) were cultured for in vitro studies. RSV-infected mice lost weight and showed significant peribronchial inflammation compared with noninfected controls and UV-inactivated RSV-inoculated animals. RSV infection increased the permeability of the airway epithelial barrier and altered the molecular composition of epithelial tight junctions. The observed RSV-induced barrier disruption was accompanied by decreased expression of several tight-junction proteins and accumulation of cleaved extracellular fragments of E-cadherin in bronchoalveolar lavage and mTEC supernatants. Similarly, in vitro RSV infection of mTEC monolayers resulted in enhanced permeability and disruption of tight-junction structure. Furthermore, incubation of mTEC monolayers with a recombinant fragment of E-cadherin caused tight-junction disassembly. Taken together, these data indicate that RSV infection leads to airway barrier dysfunction in vivo, mediated by either decreased expression or cleavage of junctional proteins. Our observations provide further insights into the pathophysiology of RSV infection and provide a rationale for development of barrier-protecting agents to alleviate the pathogenic effects of RSV infection.

Spillover events are rare and several factors must align to create the perfect storm that would ultimately lead to a spillover. One of these factors is the increased shedding of virus by bats. Several studies have indicated that bats have unique defense mechanisms that allow them to be persistently or latently infected with viruses. Factors leading to an increase in the viral load of persistently infected bats would facilitate shedding of virus. This article reviews the unique nature of bat immune defenses that regulate virus replication and the various molecular mechanisms that play a role in altering the balanced bat-virus relationship.

Global Epidemiology of Bat Coronaviruses								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	2					174	10.3390/v11020174				FEB 2019	2019	Bats are a unique group of mammals of the order Chiroptera. They are highly diversified and are the group of mammals with the second largest number of species. Such highly diversified cell types and receptors facilitate them to be potential hosts of a large variety of viruses. Bats are the only group of mammals capable of sustained flight, which enables them to disseminate the viruses they harbor and enhance the chance of interspecies transmission. This article aims at reviewing the various aspects of the global epidemiology of bat coronaviruses (CoVs). Before the SARS epidemic, bats were not known to be hosts for CoVs. In the last 15 years, bats have been found to be hosts of >30 CoVs with complete genomes sequenced, and many more if those without genome sequences are included. Among the four CoV genera, only alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been found in bats. As a whole, both alphaCoVs and betaCoVs have been detected from bats in Asia, Europe, Africa, North and South America and Australasia; but alphaCoVs seem to be more widespread than betaCoVs, and their detection rate is also higher. For betaCoVs, only those from subgenera Sarbecovirus, Merbecovirus, Nobecovirus and Hibecovirus have been detected in bats. Most notably, horseshoe bats are the reservoir of SARS-CoV, and several betaCoVs from subgenus Merbecovirus are closely related to MERS-CoV. In addition to the interactions among various bat species themselves, bat-animal and bat-human interactions, such as the presence of live bats in wildlife wet markets and restaurants in Southern China, are important for interspecies transmission of CoVs and may lead to devastating global outbreaks.

Focusing on the European Bat Lyssavirus subtype 1 (EBLV-1), causing rabies disease, we develop a data-driven spatially explicit metapopulation model to investigate EBLV-1 persistence in Myotis myotis and Miniopterus schreibersii bat species in Catalonia. We find that persistence relies on host spatial structure through the migratory nature of M. schreibersii, on cross-species mixing with M. myotis, and on survival of infected animals followed by temporary immunity. The virus would not persist in the single colony of M. myotis. Our study provides for the first time epidemiological estimates for EBLV-1 progression in M. schreibersii. Our approach can be readily adapted to other zoonoses of public health concern where long-range migration and habitat sharing may play an important role.

The epidemics in eastern Africa occur in a 5-15 year cycle coinciding with abnormally high rainfall generally associated to the warm phase of the El Nino event. However, recently, evidence has been gathered of inter-epidemic transmission. An open-source, easily applicable, accessible and modifiable model was built to simulate the transmission dynamics of RVF. The model was calibrated using data collected in the Kilombero Valley in Tanzania with people and cattle as host species and AEdes mcintoshi, AE. aegypti and two Culex species as vectors. Simulations were run over a period of 27 years using standard parameter values derived from two previous studies in this region. Our model predicts low-level transmission of RVF, which is in line with epidemiological studies in this area. Emphasis in our simulation was put on both the dynamics and composition of vector populations in three ecological zones, in order to elucidate the respective roles played by different vector species: the model output did indicate the necessity of Culex involvement and also indicated that vertical transmission in AEdes mcintoshi may be underestimated. This model, being built with open-source software and with an easy-to-use interface, can be adapted by researchers and control program managers to their specific needs by plugging in new parameters relevant to their situation and locality.

Further, although vaccination can prevent disease, vaccine development is impeded by several factors. Therefore, novel approaches to treat and manage respiratory infections are urgently needed. Passive immunization represents a possible alternative to meet this need. Immunoglobulin Y antibodies (IgYs) from the yolk of chicken eggs have previously been used against bacterial and viral infections in human and animals. Their advantages include lack of reaction with mammalian Fc receptors, low production cost, and ease of extraction. Compared to mammalian IgGs, they have higher target specificity and greater binding avidity. They also possess remarkable pathogen-neutralizing activity in the respiratory tract and lungs. In this review, we provide an overview of avian IgYs and describe their potential therapeutic applications for the prevention and treatment of respiratory infections.

CSV2018 attracted 175 attendees from across Canada and around the world, more than double the number that attended the first CSV symposium two years earlier. CSV2018 provided a forum to discuss a wide range of topics in virology including human, veterinary, plant, and microbial pathogens. Invited keynote speakers included David Kelvin (Dalhousie University and Shantou University Medical College) who provided a historical perspective on influenza on the 100th anniversary of the 1918 pandemic; Sylvain Moineau (Universite Laval) who described CRISPR-Cas systems and anti-CRISPR proteins in warfare between bacteriophages and their host microbes; and Kate O'Brien (then from Johns Hopkins University, now relocated to the World Health Organization where she is Director of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals), who discussed the underlying viral etiology for pneumonia in the developing world, and the evidence for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a primary cause. Reflecting a strong commitment of Canadian virologists to science communication, CSV2018 featured the launch of Halifax's first annual Soapbox Science event to enable public engagement with female scientists, and the live-taping of the 499th episode of the This Week in Virology (TWIV) podcast, hosted by Vincent Racaniello (Columbia University) and science writer Alan Dove. TWIV featured interviews of CSV co-founders Nathalie Grandvaux (Universite de Montreal) and Craig McCormick (Dalhousie University), who discussed the origins and objectives of the new society; Ryan Noyce (University of Alberta), who discussed technical and ethical considerations of synthetic virology; and Kate O'Brien, who discussed vaccines and global health. Finally, because CSV seeks to provide a better future for the next generation of Canadian virologists, the symposium featured a large number of oral and poster presentations from trainees and closed with the awarding of presentation prizes to trainees, followed by a tour of the Halifax Citadel National Historic Site and an evening of entertainment at the historic Alexander Keith's Brewery.

To bring new data regarding HPgV genomic diversity, we investigated 16 French isolates obtained from hepatitis C virus-RNA and human immunodeficiency virus-RNA-positive blood donations following deep sequencing and coupled molecular protocols. Initial phylogenetic analysis of 5 '-untranslated region (5 '-UTR)/E2 partial sequences permitted to assign HPgV isolates to genotypes 2 (n = 15) and 1 (n = 1), with up to 16% genetic diversity observed for both regions considered. Seven nearly full-length representative genomes were characterized subsequently, with complete polyprotein coding sequences exhibiting up to 13% genetic diversity; closest nucleotide (nt) divergence with available HPgV sequences was in the range 7% to 11%. A 36 nts deletion located on the NS4B coding region (N-terminal part, 12 amino acids) of the genotype 1 HPgV genome characterized was identified, along with single nucleotide deletions in two genotype 2, 5 '-UTR sequences.

TRANSBOUNDARY ANIMAL DISEASES IN SAHELIAN AFRICA AND CONNECTED REGIONS								121	148		10.1007/978-3-030-25385-1_8	10.1007/978-3-030-25385-1			2019	2019	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral infection mostly encountered in Africa. In its acute form, it severely affects domestic and wild ruminants, dromedaries, and humans. It is considered as an emerging disease, with increased frequency in several regions, and a spread potential to many areas under the influence of two main drivers: environmental (including climatic) changes and animal mobility (livestock trade, transhumance). In this chapter, we discuss the peculiarities of RVF epidemiology in Sahelian Africa and we show how the joint influence of these two drivers may trigger RVF epidemics.The public health impact of RVF can be severe, with tens of thousands of human cases and hundreds of fatalities recorded during large epidemics. Beyond its direct, negative effects on public and animal health, RVF has large economic consequences related to bans on livestock importation from infected countries. Solutions are available to improve surveillance and control of RVF in Sahelian Africa according to well-defined, risk-based strategies. The implementation of coordinated actions between Public Health and Animal Health authorities would represent an important advance in the One Health joint approach of RVF for better prevention, early detection, and reaction.

J	Mazzola, Laura T.; Kelly-Cirino, Cassandra								Diagnostics for Nipah virus: a zoonotic pathogen endemic to Southeast Asia								BMJ GLOBAL HEALTH				4						e001118	10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001118			2	JAN 2019	2019	Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging pathogen that, unlike other priority pathogens identified by WHO, is endemic to Southeast Asia. It is most commonly transmitted through exposure to saliva or excrement from the Pteropus fruit bat, or direct contact with intermediate animal hosts, such as pigs. NiV infection causes severe febrile encephalitic disease and/ or respiratory disease; treatment options are limited to supportive care. A number of in-house diagnostic assays for NiV using serological and nucleic acid amplification techniques have been developed for NiV and are used in laboratory settings, including some early multiplex panels for differentiation of NiV infection from other febrile diseases. However, given the often rural and remote nature of NiV outbreak settings, there remains a need for rapid diagnostic tests that can be implemented at the point of care. Additionally, more reliable assays for surveillance of communities and livestock will be vital to achieving a better understanding of the ecology of the fruit bat host and transmission risk to other intermediate hosts, enabling implementation of a ` One Health' approach to outbreak prevention and the management of this zoonotic disease. An improved understanding of NiV viral diversity and infection kinetics or dynamics will be central to the development of new diagnostics, and access to clinical specimens must be improved to enable effective validation and external quality assessments. Target product profiles for NiV diagnostics should be refined to take into account these outstanding needs.																					WOS:000471820000005	30815286

Anthropization has several important effects on animal communities and the Brazilian Cerrado, a Neotropical savannah, has been severely affected by human activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate phyllostomid bat assemblage distributions in the different landscape formations of a modified savannah. Using mist nets, we performed 36 sampling nights between 2015 and 2016. The sampling effort was 23,328 m(2).h and was equally distributed over three landscape formations: a large fragment, riparian forest, and small fragments. We compared capture rates, richness, diversity, similarity, and feeding guilds for the three formations. We captured 418 bats of 12 species belonging to the family Phyllostomidae. The most abundant species was Artibeus planirostris (Spix, 1823) (n = 126). We found no significant differences in capture rate or diversity between the areas, but there were differences in feeding guild representation. Frugivores species were the most abundant in the three areas. No gleaning insectivore or carnivore species were captured in the small fragments, and the large fragment contained no hematophages. The large fragment and the small fragments had the greatest similarity whereas the riparian forest and small fragments had the least similarity.																					WOS:000469762600001

Respiratory syncytial virus infection in mice inducing airway disfunction associated with lung tissue inflammation as a model of human pathology								Immunologiya				40	5			72	83		10.24411/0206-4952-2019-15008				2019	2019	Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the main cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. RSV infection, characterized by high morbidity and mortality, is a serious public health problem. There are no licensed vaccines available for the prevention of this disease. Save and affordable medications for RSV treatment were not developed yet. One of the main difficulties to study RSV pathogenesis and to develop new approaches for its therapy is the lack universal animal model that recapitulates all aspects of human pathology.There are exist animal models of RSV infection in mice, rats, ferrets, calves, sheeps, chimpanzees, etc. Most often, mice are used for RSV modeling, since their use is most economically feasible. However, RSV is not a natural pathogen for mice, therefore its replication in the mouse respiratory tract is not significant, and pathological features are poorly expressed. That is the main reason why all aspects of human RSV pathology could not be reproduced in mice simultaneously. In this study, we created the BALB/c mouse infection protocol with purified and concentrated RSV (strain A2), which allows induce such clinically significant manifestations of human pathology as bronchial hyperreactivity, pneumonia, respiratory tract infiltration by pro-inflammatory cells, etc. A study showed that RSV infection activates mainly Th1 immune response in mice, which is consistent with clinical observations in humans. Model of RSV infection in mice developed in this study can be used both to clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and to test new approaches for anti-RSV therapy.

Nipah virus: epidemiology, pathology, immunobiology and advances in diagnosis, vaccine designing and control strategies - a comprehensive review								VETERINARY QUARTERLY				39	1			26	55		10.1080/01652176.2019.1580827				JAN 1 2019	2019	Nipah (Nee-pa) viral disease is a zoonotic infection caused by Nipah virus (NiV), a paramyxovirus belonging to the genus Henipavirus of the family Paramyxoviridae. It is a biosafety level-4 pathogen, which is transmitted by specific types of fruit bats, mainly Pteropus spp. which are natural reservoir host. The disease was reported for the first time from the Kampung Sungai Nipah village of Malaysia in 1998. Human-to-human transmission also occurs. Outbreaks have been reported also from other countries in South and Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic analysis affirmed the circulation of two major clades of NiV as based on currently available complete N and G gene sequences. NiV isolates from Malaysia and Cambodia clustered together in NiV-MY clade, whereas isolates from Bangladesh and India clusterered within NiV-BD clade. NiV isolates from Thailand harboured mixed population of sequences. In humans, the virus is responsible for causing rapidly progressing severe illness which might be characterized by severe respiratory illness and/or deadly encephalitis. In pigs below six months of age, respiratory illness along with nervous symptoms may develop. Different types of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays along with molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction have been developed for diagnostic purposes. Due to the expensive nature of the antibody drugs, identification of broad-spectrum antivirals is essential along with focusing on small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). High pathogenicity of NiV in humans, and lack of vaccines or therapeutics to counter this disease have attracted attention of researchers worldwide for developing effective NiV vaccine and treatment regimens.

Habitat loss has increased the peri-urban presence of flying-foxes, increasing the risk of contact and therefore viral 'spillovers' into horse and human populations. An equine vaccine is available and horse-husbandry practices that minimize HeV exposure are encouraged, but their adoption is suboptimal. Ecological approaches-such as habitat creation and conservation-could complement vaccination and behavioural strategies by reducing spillover risks, but these are controversial.MethodsWe convened three community juries (two regional; one metropolitan) to elicit the views of well-informed citizens on the acceptability of adding ecological approaches to current interventions for HeV risk. Thirty-one participants of diverse backgrounds, mixed genders and ages were recruited using random-digit-dialling. Each jury was presented with balanced factual evidence, given time to ask questions of expert presenters and, after deliberation, come to well-reasoned conclusions.ResultsAll juries voted unanimously that ecological strategies should be included in HeV risk management strategies but concluded that current interventions-including vaccination and changing horse-husbandry practices-must remain the priority. The key reasons given for adopting ecological approaches were: (i) they address underlying drivers of disease emergence, (ii) the potential to prevent spillover of other bat-borne pathogens, and (iii) there would be broader community benefits. Juries differed regarding the best mechanism to create/conserve flying-fox habitat: participants in regional centres favoured direct government action, whereas the metropolitan jury preferred to place the burden on landholders.ConclusionsInformed citizens acknowledge the value of addressing the drivers of bat-borne infectious risks but differ substantially as to the best implementation strategies. Ecological approaches to securing bat habitat could find broad social support in Australia, but disagreement about how best to achieve them indicates the need for negotiation with affected communities to co-develop fair, effective and locally appropriate policies.

Predicting wildlife reservoirs and global vulnerability to zoonotic Flaviviruses								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				9						5425	10.1038/s41467-018-07896-2				DEC 21 2018	2018	Flaviviruses continue to cause globally relevant epidemics and have emerged or re-emerged in regions that were previously unaffected. Factors determining emergence of flaviviruses and continuing circulation in sylvatic cycles are incompletely understood. Here we identify potential sylvatic reservoirs of flaviviruses and characterize the macro-ecological traits common to known wildlife hosts to predict the risk of sylvatic flavivirus transmission among wildlife and identify regions that could be vulnerable to outbreaks. We evaluate variability in wildlife hosts for zoonotic flaviviruses and find that flaviviruses group together in distinct clusters with similar hosts. Models incorporating ecological and climatic variables as well as life history traits shared by flaviviruses predict new host species with similar host characteristics. The combination of vector distribution data with models for flavivirus hosts allows for prediction of global vulnerability to flaviviruses and provides potential targets for disease surveillance in animals and humans.

Viral Enrichment Methods Affect the Detection but Not Sequence Variation of West Nile Virus in Equine Brain Tissue								FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				5						318	10.3389/fvets.2018.00318				DEC 18 2018	2018	West Nile virus (WNV), a small, positive sense, single stranded RNA virus continues to encroach into new locales with emergence of new viral variants. Neurological disease in the equine can be moderate to severe in the face of low to undetectable virus loads. Physical methods of virus enrichment may increase sensitivity of virus detection and enhance analysis of viral diversity, especially for deep sequencing studies. However, the use of these techniques is limited mainly to non-neural tissues. We investigated the hypothesis that elimination of equine brain RNA enhances viral detection without limiting viral variation. Eight different WNV viral RNA enrichment and host RNA separation methods were evaluated to determine if elimination of host RNA enhanced detection of WNV and increase the repertoire of virus variants for sequencing. Archived brain tissue from 21 different horses was inoculated with WNV, homogenized, before enrichment and separation. The protocols utilized combinations of low-speed centrifugation, syringe filtration, and nuclease treatment. Viral and host RNA were analyzed using real-time PCR targeting the WNV Envelope (E) protein and equine G3PDH to determine relative sensitivity for WNV and host depletion, respectively. To determine the effect of these methods on viral variation, deep sequencing of the E protein was performed. Our results demonstrate that additional separation and enrichment methods resulted in loss of virus in the face of host RNA depletion. DNA sequencing showed no significant difference in total sequence variation between the RNA enrichment protocols. For equine brain infected with WNV, direct RNA extraction followed by host RNA depletion was most suitable. This study highlights the importance of evaluating viral enrichment and separation methods according to tissue type before embarking on studies where quantification of virus and viral variants is essential to the outcome of the study.

Also, their corresponding knock-out or knock-in derivatives have been the most commonly used animal systems in immunological studies. With much credit to their usefulness, laboratory mice will never provide all the answers to fully understand immunological processes. Large animal models offer unique biological and experimental advantages that have been and continue to be of great value to the understanding of biological and immunological processes. From the identification of B cells to the realization that gamma delta T cells can function as professional antigen presenting cells, farm animals have contributed significantly to a better understanding of immunity.

Productive Propagation of Rift Valley Fever Phlebovirus Vaccine Strain MP-12 in Rousettus aegyptiacus Fruit Bats								VIRUSES-BASEL				10	12					681	10.3390/v10120681				DEC 2018	2018	Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV), the causative agent of an emerging zoonotic disease in Africa and Arabia, can infect a variety of species, predominantly ruminants, camelids, and humans. While clinical symptoms are mostly absent in adult ruminants and camelids, RVFV infection may lead to a serious, sometimes fatal disease in humans. Virus transmissions between individuals and between species mainly occur through mosquito bites, but direct or even indirect contact with infectious materials may also result in infection. Although the main reservoir of the virus is not yet identified, small mammals such as rodents and bats may act as amplifying hosts. We therefore inoculated Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats that are abundant in northern Africa with the vaccine strain MP-12, in order to elucidate the general competence of this species for virus propagation and transmission. We were able to detect the RVFV genome in the spleen of each of these animals, and re-isolated the virus from the spleen and liver of some animals. Moreover, we were able to identify the Gc RVFV surface antigen in mild subacute multifocal necrotizing hepatic lesions of one bat which was sacrificed 7 days post exposure. These findings demonstrate that Rousettus aegyptiacus fruit bats can propagate RVFV.																					WOS:000455313100020	30513679

Rhinovirus is most frequently-detected pathogen; followed by respiratory syncytial virus; metapneumovirus; parainfluenza virus; enterovirus and coronavirus. In addition; viral infection; in combination with genetics; allergen exposure; microbiome and other pathogens; may play a role in asthma development. In particular; asthma development has been linked to wheezing-associated respiratory viral infections in early life. To understand underlying mechanisms of viral-induced airways disease; investigators have studied respiratory viral infections in small animals. This report reviews animal models of human respiratory viral infection employing mice; rats; guinea pigs; hamsters and ferrets. Investigators have modeled asthma exacerbations by infecting mice with allergic airways disease. Asthma development has been modeled by administration of virus to immature animals. Small animal models of respiratory viral infection will identify cell and molecular targets for the treatment of asthma.																					WOS:000455313100021	30513770

The respiratory epithelium internally lining the airways is susceptible to infections due to constant exposure to inhaled microbes. Biomedical research into respiratory bacterial infections in humans has been mostly carried out using small mammalian animal models or two-dimensional, submerged cultures of undifferentiated epithelial cells. These experimental model systems have considerable limitations due to host specificity of bacterial pathogens and lack of cellular and morphological complexity. This review describes the in vitro differentiated and polarized airway epithelial cells of human origin that are used as a model to study respiratory bacterial infections. Overall, these models recapitulate key aspects of the complexity observed in vivo and can help in elucidating the molecular details of disease processes observed during respiratory bacterial infections.

The life cycle of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is closely associated with the ER. Synthesis and maturation of HCV proteins occur in the ER membrane and are mediated by multiple host cell factors that include also PDI. Here, we present a study investigating the effect of PDI inhibition on Huh7 human hepatoma cells harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon using the abscisic acid-derived PDI inhibitor origamicin. Transcriptional profiling shows that origamicin changed the expression levels of genes involved in the oxidative and ER stress responses and the unfolded protein response, as indicated by the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and chaperone proteins, the downregulation of cell-cycle proteins, and induction of apoptosis-associated genes. Our data suggest that origamicin negatively impacts HCV replication by causing an imbalance in cellular homoeostasis and induction of stress responses. These insights suggest that inhibition of PDIs by low-molecular- weight inhibitors could be a promising approach to the discovery of novel antiviral compounds.

In vitro model studies include reverse genetics systems, two-dimensional (2D) cell models, such as primary cells and cell lines, and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) models derived from skin, brain and placenta. While these models are cost-effective and allow rigorous control of experimental variables, they do not always recapitulate in vivo scenarios. Thus, a number of in vivo models have been developed, including mosquitoes (Aedes sp. and Culex sp.), embryonated chicken eggs, immunocompetent and immunodeficient mice strains, hamsters, guinea pigs, conventional swine and non-human primates. In this review, we summarize the main research systems that have been developed in recent years and discuss their advantages, limitations and main applications.

Enzootic, epizootic and zoonotic RVFV transmission dynamics remain ill-defined, particularly due to a poor understanding of the role of mammalian hosts in the epidemiology and infection ecology of this arbovirus. Using a piecewise structural equation model, this study sought to identify associations between biological and ecological characteristics of mammalian species and documented RVFV infection to highlight species-level traits that may influence wildlife host status. Interspecific network centrality, size of species home range and reproductive life-history traits were all associated with being an RVFV host. The identification of these species-level characteristics may help to provide ecological context for the role of wildlife amplification hosts in the epidemiology of spillover to livestock and humans and may also help to identify specific points of vulnerability at the wildlife-livestock interface.

To gain more insight, microbial communities in fecal samples from 37 insectivorous bats of different species from the Netherlands were investigated by polymerase chain reaction and denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Subsequently, 10 samples from the following bat species: common pipistrelle (Pipistrellus pipistrellus; n = 3), Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii; n = 3), serotine bat (Eptesicus serotinus; n = 1), whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus; n = 1), Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus; n = 1) and Natterer's bat (Myotis nattereri; n = 1) were selected and used in bacterial 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing. The fecal microbiota in bats was found to be diverse with predominant bacterial genera Carnobacterium, Serratia, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus and Yersinia. The presence of opportunistic pathogens Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Serratia fonticola and Rahnella aquatilis was also recorded. Based on cloning results, we found no proof that bats in the Netherlands are a major vector for the transmission of bacterial zoonotic diseases, although previous findings in literature reported isolation of foodborne pathogens from bats.

Although this mosquito-borne disease is self-limiting and is not associated with high mortality, it can lead to severe, chronic and disabling arthritis, thereby posing a heavy burden to healthcare systems. The two main vectors for CHIKV are Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (Asian tiger mosquito); however, many other mosquito species have been described as competent CHIKV vectors in scientific literature. With climate change, globalization and unfettered urban planning affecting many areas, CHIKV poses a significant public health risk to many countries. A scoping review was conducted to collate and categorize all pertinent information gleaned from published scientific literature on a priori defined aspects of CHIKV and its competent vectors. After developing a sensitive and specific search algorithm for the research question, seven databases were searched and data was extracted from 1920 relevant articles. Results show that CHIKV research is reported predominantly in areas after major epidemics have occurred. There has been an upsurge in CHIKV publications since 2011, especially after first reports of CHIKV emergence in the Americas. A list of hosts and vectors that could potentially be involved in the sylvatic and urban transmission cycles of CHIKV has been compiled in this scoping review.

The objective of this review was to determine the distribution of hepatitis virus genotypes in West African countries. A systematic review of the literature in PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct was performed to identify 52 relevant articles reporting hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and G viruses genotypes. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype E with a prevalence of 90.6% (95%CI: 0.891-0.920) found in this review, is characterized by low genetic diversity. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 and 2 represented 96.4% of HCV infections in West African countries, while hepatitis delta virus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis G virus genotypes 1 and HEV genotype 3 were reported in some studies in Ghana and Nigeria. HBV genotype E is characterized by high prevalence, low genetic diversity and wide geographical distribution. Further studies on the clinical implications of HBV genotype E and HCV genotypes 1 and 2 are needed for the development of an effective treatment against this viral hepatitis in West African countries. Surveillance of the distribution of different genotypes is also needed to reduce recombination rates and prevent the emergence of more virulent viral strains.

Identifying and Tracking Low-Frequency Virus-Specific TCR Clonotypes Using High-Throughput Sequencing								CELL REPORTS				25	9			2369	+		10.1016/j.celrep.2018.11.009				NOV 27 2018	2018	Tracking antigen-specific T cell responses over time within individuals is difficult because of lack of knowledge of antigen-specific TCR sequences, limitations in sample size, and assay sensitivities. We hypothesized that analyses of high-throughput sequencing of TCR clonotypes could provide functional readouts of individuals' immunological histories. Using high-throughput TCR sequencing, we develop a database of TCR beta sequences from large cohorts of mice before (naive) and after smallpox vaccination. We computationally identify 315 vaccine-associated TCR sequences (VATS) that are used to train a diagnostic classifier that distinguishes naive from vaccinated samples in mice up to 9 months post-vaccination with >99% accuracy. We determine that the VATS library contains virusresponsive TCRs by in vitro expansion assays and virus-specific tetramer sorting. These data outline a platform for advancing our capabilities to identify pathogen-specific TCR sequences, which can be used to identify and quantitate low-frequency pathogen-specific TCR sequences in circulation over time with exceptional sensitivity.

Modeling of fusion inhibitor treatment of RSV in African green monkeys								JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY				456				62	73		10.1016/j.jtbi.2018.07.029				NOV 7 2018	2018	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a respiratory infection that can cause serious illness, particularly in infants. In this study, we test four different model implementations for the effect of a fusion inhibitor, including one model that combines different drug effects, by fitting the models to data from a study of TMC353121 in African green monkeys. We use mathematical modeling to estimate the drug efficacy parameters, epsilon(max), the maximum efficacy of the drug, and EC50, the drug concentration needed to achieve half the maximum effect. We find that if TMC353121 is having multiple effects on viral kinetics, more detailed data, using different treatment delays, is needed to detect this effect. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The pathogenesis of vascular anomalies is still poorly understood. Viral infection was speculated as a possible underlying cause. Materials and Methods: A total of 13 human vascular anomalies and three human skin control tissues were used for viral analysis. RNA derived from AVM (n=4) and normal skin control (n=3) tissues was evaluated by RNA sequencing. The Virome Capture Sequencing Platform for Vertebrate Viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) was deployed on 10 tissues with vascular anomalies (2xAVM, 1xHA, 1xLM, 2xVLM, 4xVM). Results: RNA sequencing did not show any correlation of AVM with viral infection. By deploying VirCapSeq-VERT, no consistent viral association was seen in the tested tissues. Conclusion: The analysis does not point to the presence of an active viral infection in vascular anomalies. However, transient earlier viral infections, e.g. during pregnancy, cannot be excluded with this approach.																					WOS:000447885500004	30348684

Members of this virus family are positive-strand RNA viruses and replicate their genome in close association with reorganized intracellular host cell membrane compartments. This evolutionarily conserved strategy facilitates efficient viral genome replication and contributes to evasion from host cell cytosolic defense mechanisms. We have previously described the identification of a small-compound inhibitor, K22, which exerts a potent antiviral activity against a broad range of coronaviruses by targeting membrane-bound viral RNA replication. To analyze the antiviral spectrum of this inhibitor, we assessed the inhibitory potential of K22 against several members of the Flaviviridae family, including the reemerging Zika virus (ZIKV). We show that ZIKV is strongly affected by K22. Time-of-addition experiments revealed that K22 acts during a postentry phase of the ZIKV life cycle, and combination regimens of K22 together with ribavirin (RBV) or interferon alpha (IFN-a) further increased the extent of viral inhibition. Ultrastructural electron microscopy studies revealed severe alterations of ZIKV-induced intracellular replication compartments upon infection of K22-treated cells. Importantly, the antiviral activity of K22 was demonstrated against several other members of the Flaviviridae family. It is tempting to speculate that K22 exerts its broad antiviral activity against several positive-strand RNA viruses via a similar mechanism and thereby represents an attractive candidate for development as a panviral inhibitor.

Detection of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) antibodies in animals in regions with no previous history of outbreaks raises the question of whether the disease is overlooked due to lack-of effective surveillance systems, or if there are strains of RVFV with low pathogenicity. Furthermore, which vertebrate hosts are involved in the inter-epidemic and inter-epizootic maintenance of RVFV? In our study region, the Kyela and Morogoro districts in Tanzania, no previous RVF outbreaks have been reported.MethodologyThe study was conducted from June 2014 to October 2015 in the Kyela and Morogoro districts, Tanzania. Samples (n = 356) were retrieved from both the local breed of zebu cattle (Bos indicus) and Bos indicus/Bos Taurus cross breed. RVFV antibodies were analyzed by two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approaches. Initially, samples were analyzed by a RVFV multi-species competition ELISA (cELISA), which detected both RVFV IgG and IgM antibodies. All serum samples that were positive with the cELISA method were specifically analysed for the presence of RVFV IgM antibodies to trace recent infection. A plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT80) was performed to determine presence of RVFV neutralizing antibodies in all cELISA positive samples.FindingsOverall RVFV seroprevalence rate in cattle by cELISA in both districts was 29.2% (104 of 356) with seroprevalence rates of 33% (47/147) in the Kyela district and 27% (57/209) in the Morogoro district. In total, 8.4% (30/356) of all cattle sampled had RVFV IgM antibodies, indicating current disease transmission. When segregated by districts, the IgM antibody seroprevalence was 2.0% (3/147) and 12.9% (27/209) in Kyela and Morogoro districts respectively. When the 104 cELISA positive samples were analyzed by PRNT80 to confirm that RVFV-specific antibodies were present, the majority (89%, 93/104) had RVFV neutralising antibodies.ConclusionThe results provided evidence of widespread prevalence of RVFV antibody among cattle during an inter-epizootic/inter-epidemic period in Tanzania in regions with no previous history of outbreaks. There is a need for further investigations of RVFV maintenance and transmission in vertebrates and vectors during the long inter-epizootic/inter-epidemic periods.

Temporal differentiation of bovine airway epithelial cells grown at an air-liquid interface								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						14893	10.1038/s41598-018-33180-w				OCT 5 2018	2018	There is an urgent need to develop improved, physiologically-relevant in vitro models of airway epithelia with which to better understand the pathological processes associated with infection, allergies and toxicological insults of the respiratory tract of both humans and domesticated animals. In the present study, we have characterised the proliferation and differentiation of primary bovine bronchial epithelial cells (BBECs) grown at an air-liquid interface (ALI) at three-day intervals over a period of 42 days from the introduction of the ALI. The differentiated BBEC model was highly representative of the ex vivo epithelium from which the epithelial cells were derived; a columnar, pseudostratified epithelium that was highly reflective of native airway epithelium was formed which comprised ciliated, goblet and basal cells. The hallmark defences of the respiratory tract, namely barrier function and mucociliary clearance, were present, thus demonstrating that the model is an excellent mimic of bovine respiratory epithelium. The epithelium was fully differentiated by day 21 post-ALI and, crucially, remained healthy and stable for a further 21 days. Thus, the differentiated BBEC model has a three-week window which will allow wide-ranging and long-term experiments to be performed in the fields of infection, toxicology or general airway physiology.

The pathogenesis of Flaviviridae infections is very complex and not fully understood because these viruses can inhibit multiple immune pathways including the complement system, NK cells, and IFN induction and signalling pathways. The non-structural (NS) 5 and 5A proteins of Flaviviridae viruses are highly conserved and play an important role in resisting host immunity through various evasion mechanisms. This review summarizes the strategies used by the NS5 and 5A proteins of Flaviviridae viruses for evading the innate immune response by inhibiting pattern recognition receptor (PRR) signalling pathways (TLR/MyD88, IRF7), suppressing interferon (IFN) signalling pathways (IFN-gamma Rs, STAT1, STAT2), and impairing the function of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (e.g. protein kinase R [PKR], oligoadenylate synthase [OAS]). All of these immune evasion mechanisms depend on the interaction of NS5 or NS5A with cellular proteins, such as MyD88 and IRF7, IFN-alpha Rs, IFN-gamma Rs, STAT1, STAT2, PKR and OAS. NS5 is the most attractive target for the discovery of broad spectrum compounds against Flaviviridae virus infection. The methyltransferase (MTase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities of NS5 are the main therapeutic targets for antiviral drugs against Flaviviridae virus infection. Based on our site mapping, the sites involved in immune evasion provide some potential and promising targets for further novel antiviral therapeutics. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, viral kinetics are different in vitro, in animals, and in humans, so it is sometimes difficult to translate results from one system to another. In this study, we use a mathematical model to fit experimental data from multiple cycle respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in vitro, in african green monkey (AGM), and in humans in order to quantitatively compare viral kinetics in the different systems. We find that there are differences in viral clearance rate, productively infectious cell lifespan, and eclipse phase duration between in vitro and in vivo systems and among different in vivo systems. We show that these differences in viral kinetics lead to different estimates of drug effectiveness of fusion inhibitors in vitro and in AGM than in humans.

Advances in knowledge of the structural biology of the RSV surface fusion glycoprotein have revolutionised RSV vaccine development by providing a new target for preventive interventions. The RSV vaccine landscape has rapidly expanded to include 19 vaccine candidates and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in clinical trials, reflecting the urgency of reducing this global health problem and hence the prioritisation of RSV vaccine development. The candidates include mAbs and vaccines using four approaches: (1) particle-based, (2) live-attenuated or chimeric, (3) subunit, (4) vector-based. Late-phase RSV vaccine trial failures highlight gaps in knowledge regarding immunological protection and provide lessons for future development. In this Review, we highlight promising new approaches for RSV vaccine design and provide a comprehensive overview of RSV vaccine candidates and mAbs in clinical development to prevent one of the most common and severe infectious diseases in young children and older adults worldwide.

TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				65	5			1372	1376		10.1111/tbed.12874				OCT 2018	2018	West Nile virus (WNV), Usutu virus (USUV) and tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) are emerging zoonotic flaviviruses (family Flaviviridae), which have circulated in Europe in the past decade. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess exposure to these antigenically related flaviviruses in eastern grey squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) in Italy. Seventeen out of 158 (10.8%; CI95%: 5.9-15.6) squirrels' sera tested through bELISA had antibodies against flaviviruses. Specific neutralizing antibodies to WNV, USUV and TBEV were detected by virus neutralization tests. Our results indicate that tree squirrels are exposed to Culex and tick-borne zoonotic flaviviruses in Italy. Moreover, this study shows for the first time USUV and TBEV exposure in grey squirrels, broadening the host range reported for these viruses. Even though further studies are needed to define the real role of tree squirrels in the epidemiology of flaviviruses in Europe, this study highlights that serology could be an effective approach for future investigations aimed at broadening our knowledge about the species exposed to these zoonotic infections.

Since its initial emergence in 1998 in Malaysia, this virus has become a great threat to domestic animals and humans. Sporadic outbreaks and person-to-person transmission over the past two decades have resulted in hundreds of human fatalities. Epidemiological surveys have shown that NiV is distributed in Asia, Africa, and the South Pacific Ocean, and is transmitted by its natural reservoir, Pteropid bats. Numerous efforts have been made to analyze viral protein function and structure to develop feasible strategies for drug design.

The disease is caused by species belonging to the genus Lyssavirus. Five Lyssavirus species, i.e., European bat lyssavirus (EBLV)-1, EBLV-2, Bokeloh bat lyssavirus, Lleida bat lyssavirus, and West Caucasian bat virus, have been identified in European bats. More recently, a proposed sixth species, Kotalahti bat lyssavirus, was detected. Thus, in this study, active surveillance was initiated in order to obtain insights into the prevalence of lyssaviruses in Croatian bat populations and to improve our understanding of the public health threat of infected bats.Results: In total, 455 bats were caught throughout Continental and Mediterranean Croatia. Antibodies were found in 20 of 350 bats (5.71%, 95% confidence interval 3.73-8.66). The majority of seropositive bats were found in Trbusnjak cave (Continental Croatia, Eastern part), and most seropositive bats belonged to Myotis myotis (13/20). All oropharyngeal swabs were negative for the presence of Lyssavirus.Conclusions: The presence of lyssaviruses in bat populations was confirmed for the first time in Croatia and Southeastern Europe. The results of this study suggest the need for further comprehensive analyses of lyssaviruses in bats in this part of Europe.																					WOS:000443978000001	30189884

Because this virus has also been associated with better prognosis in the setting of co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus, we further assessed the association of HPgV with prognosis. We used risk factor data and banked plasma samples from 2094 lymphoma cases newly diagnosed between 2002 and 2009 and 1572 frequency-matched controls. Plasma samples were tested for HPgV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and those with RNA concentrations <5000 genome equivalents/ml were confirmed using nested RT-PCR methods. To assess the role of HPgV in lymphoma prognosis, we used 2948 cases from a cohort study of newly diagnosed lymphoma patients (included all cases from the case-control study). There was a positive association of HPgV viraemia with risk of lymphoma overall (Odds ratio=214; 95% confidence interval [CI] 163-280; P<00001), and for all major subtypes except Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, and this was not confounded by other lymphoma risk factors. In contrast, there was no association of HPgV viraemia with event-free survival (Hazard ratio [HR]=100; 95% CI 085-118) or overall survival (HR=097; 95% CI 079-120) for lymphoma overall, or any of the subtypes. These data support the hypothesis for a role of HPgV in the aetiology of multiple lymphoma subtypes.																					WOS:000442566500006	29808922

However, there are still no licensed vaccines for RSV. In this study, we investigated a putative vaccine based on M209-223 peptide. Mice vaccinated with M209-223 peptide expanded M209-223-specific effector CD4(+) T cells upon infection. Vaccination resulted in increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Treg) and Th1 cells, and decreased numbers of Th2 cells. In addition, vaccination with M209-223 peptide, protected mice from infection and prevented lung inflammation, leading to increase in IL-10 and IFN-gamma production by lung CD4(+) T cells. Treg depletion with anti-CTLA4 antibodies abrogated protection induced by peptide vaccination. Our results support vaccination with M209-223 peptide as an important strategy to generate protection, both systemic and local, by memory RSV-specific CD4(+) T cells in mice. Contrarily to inactivated RSV particles, M209-223 peptide vaccination is capable of not only promoting viral clearance, but also reducing inflammatory processes in lungs upon infection.

Rabies control in North America - past, present and future								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				37	2			421	437		10.20506/rst.37.2.2812				AUG 2018	2018	In the first half of the 20th century, rabies in dogs affected Canada, Mexico and the United States of America (USA). However, the role of wildlife in the transmission of the rabies virus was also recognised and outbreaks affecting both wildlife and domestic animals were documented. Canine rabies has since been eliminated from Canada and the USA, and is now only found sporadically in a few southern states of Mexico. Wildlife variant rabies viruses, found throughout the continent and geographically associated with specific reservoir species, have notable public and animal health, as well as economic, impacts. Early rabies control efforts included legislated dog management strategies and wildlife population reduction, which met with varying success. In the last 30 years, programmes for the control of rabies in dogs and wildlife have benefited from an 'Integrated Management Approach', combining education, vaccination (parenteral and oral), strategic population control, responsible pet ownership and effective stewardship of natural resources, in addition to cooperation and collaboration among local, national and international stakeholders. Looking ahead, the goal of eliminating specific wildlife virus variants will be challenged by the potential range expansion of reservoir species, due to climate change and other factors, and the risk of re-introducing eliminated virus variants. To be successful, programmes must be sustained and accompanied by advances in vaccines, enhanced distribution strategies, monitoring in the field and effective modelling of disease spread. They should also be informed by robust case surveillance, phylogenetics and an increased knowledge of vector ecology.																					WOS:000470051100010	30747137	
J	Johnson, N.; Montano-Hirose, J. A.								The impact of paralytic bovine rabies transmitted by vampire bats in Latin America and the Caribbean								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				37	2			451	459		10.20506/rst.37.2.2814				AUG 2018	2018	The effective control of dog rabies in Latin America is justifiably seen as a major success in the struggle to limit this devastating zoonosis. However, rabies remains a problem, due to the presence of the virus in bat populations throughout the region, including vampire bats. Vampire bats obtain nutrition exclusively through consuming blood by biting mammals and birds. This makes the species a highly efficient vector of the rabies virus, responsible for sporadic outbreaks of rabies in human populations and numerous cases of rabies in livestock. This, in turn, causes economic losses to the farming industry in countries throughout the region.For over four decades, efforts to control rabies have been directed at controlling the reservoir species and vaccinating cattle. However, this approach has not eliminated rabies in livestock. A major barrier to innovation in vampire rabies control is a lack of consistent surveillance to establish the extent of the problem. This precludes any calculation of its cost to the economy or the cost of potential solutions, such as vaccinating livestock. This paper outlines the problem of livestock rabies in Latin America and considers factors that influence the economic cost of potential solutions to this continuing challenge to human and livestock health.

J	Lee, Jeehyun; Klenow, Laura; Coyle, Elizabeth M.; Golding, Hana; Khurana, Surender								Protective antigenic sites in respiratory syncytial virus G attachment protein outside the central conserved and cysteine noose domains								PLOS PATHOGENS				14	8					e1007262	10.1371/journal.ppat.1007262				AUG 2018	2018	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. Previously, we elucidated the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection in infants. Whole genome-fragment phage display libraries (GFPDL) expressing linear and conformational epitopes from RSV bound 100-fold more phages within attachment protein (G) following primary RSV infection. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-termini of G ectodomain, in addition to the central conserved domain (CCD). In the current study, we examined the contribution of antigenic regions of G outside of the CCD to RSV-specific immunity. We evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization and protective efficacy of all RSV-G antigenic sites identified following primary RSV infection using recombinant E. coli expressed G ectodomain (REG), CCD-deleted G ectodomain (REG Delta CCD), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides. The REG Delta CCD, N- and C-terminal sub domains and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound fully glycosylated Recombinant Mammalian expressed G ectodomain (RMG) and intact RSV virion particles but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared with the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A2 Line 19F. Viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmunized controls. Control of viral loads post-RSV challenge correlated with serum antibody binding to the virus particles. In addition, very low Th2/Th1 cytokine ratios were found in the lungs of REG Delta CCD vaccinated mice after challenge. These data demonstrate the presence of multiple protective sites in RSV G protein outside of the CCD that could contribute to the development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein as safe and protective vaccine against RSV disease.

Serological evidence of widespread exposure of Grenada fruit bats to chikungunya virus								ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH				65	5			505	511		10.1111/zph.12460				AUG 2018	2018	Antibody detection against selected potentially zoonotic vector-borne alphaviruses and flaviviruses was conducted on sera from bats from all six parishes in Grenada, West Indies. Sera were tested for (i) antibodies to flaviviruses West Nile virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Ilheus virus, Bussuquara virus (BSQV), Rio Bravo virus and all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV) by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT); (ii) antibodies to alphaviruses western equine encephalitis virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and eastern equine encephalitis virus by epitope-blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); and (iii) antibodies to the alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV) by PRNT. Two species of fruit bats were sampled, Artibeus jamaicensis and Artibeus lituratus, all roosting in or within 1,000m of human settlements. Fifteen (36%) of the 42 bats tested for neutralizing antibodies to CHIKV were positive. The CHIKV-seropositive bats lived in localities spanning five of the six parishes. All 43 bats tested for epitope-blocking ELISA antibody to the other alphaviruses were negative, except one positive for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus. All 50 bats tested for neutralizing antibody to flaviviruses were negative, except one that had a BSQV PRNT80 titre of 20. The CHIKV serology results indicate that bats living close to and within human settlements were exposed to CHIKV in multiple locations. Importantly, bats for this study were trapped a year after the introduction and peak of the human CHIKV epidemic in Grenada. Thus, our data indicate that bats were exposed to CHIKV possibly during a time of marked decline in human cases.																					WOS:000438374600005	29575672

To investigate the importance of viral and host genetic variations in determining ZIKV infection outcomes, we created three full-length infectious cDNA clones as bacterial artificial chromosomes for each of three spatiotemporally distinct and genetically divergent ZIKVs: MR-766 (Uganda, 1947), P6-740 (Malaysia, 1966), and PRVABC-59 (Puerto Rico, 2015). Using the three molecularly cloned ZIKVs, together with 13 ZIKV region-specific polyclonal antibodies covering nearly the entire viral protein-coding region, we made three conceptual advances: (i) We created a comprehensive genome-wide portrait of ZIKV gene products and their related species, with several previously undescribed gene products identified in the case of all three molecularly cloned ZIKVs. (ii) We found that ZIKV has a broad cell tropism in vitro, being capable of establishing productive infection in 16 of 17 animal cell lines from 12 different species, although its growth kinetics varied depending on both the specific virus strain and host cell line. More importantly, we identified one ZIKV-non-susceptible bovine cell line that has a block in viral entry but fully supports the subsequent post-entry steps. (iii) We showed that in mice, the three molecularly cloned ZIKVs differ in their neuropathogenicity, depending on the particular combination of viral and host genetic backgrounds, as well as in the presence or absence of type I/II interferon signaling. Overall, our findings demonstrate the impact of viral and host genetic variations on the replication kinetics and neuropathogenicity of ZIKV and provide multiple avenues for developing and testing medical countermeasures against ZIKV.

J	Clark, Madeleine H. A.; Warimwe, George M.; Di Nardo, Antonello; Lyons, Nicholas A.; Gubbins, Simon								Systematic literature review of Rift Valley fever virus seroprevalence in livestock, wildlife and humans in Africa from 1968 to 2016								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				12	7					e0006627	10.1371/journal.pntd.0006627				JUL 2018	2018	BackgroundRift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes severe disease in livestock and humans. The virus has caused recurrent outbreaks in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula since its discovery in 1931. This review sought to evaluate RVFV seroprevalence across the African continent in livestock, wildlife and humans in order to understand the spatio-temporal distribution of RVFV seroprevalence and to identify knowledge gaps and areas requiring further research. Risk factors associated with seropositivity were identified and study designs evaluated to understand the validity of their results.MethodologyThe Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to produce a protocol to systematically search for RVFV seroprevalence studies in PubMed and Web of Science databases. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement guided the evaluation of study design and analyses.Principal findingsA total of 174 RVFV seroprevalence studies in 126 articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. RVFV seroprevalence was recorded in 31 African countries from 1968 to 2016 and varied by time, species and country. RVFV seroprevalence articles including either livestock and humans or livestock and wildlife seroprevalence records were limited in number (8/126). No articles considered wildlife, livestock and human seroprevalence concurrently, nor wildlife and humans alone. Many studies did not account for study design bias or the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests.ConclusionsFuture research should focus on conducting seroprevalence studies at the wildlife, livestock and human interface to better understand the nature of cross-species transmission of RVFV. Reporting should be more transparent and biases accounted for in future seroprevalence research to understand the true burden of disease on the African continent.

J	Donaldson, Halsie; Lucey, Daniel								Enhancing preparation for large Nipah outbreaks beyond Bangladesh: Preventing a tragedy like Ebola in West Africa								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				72				69	72		10.1016/j.ijid.2018.05.015				JUL 2018	2018	The Nipah virus has been transmitted from person-to-person via close contact in non-urban parts of India (including Kerala May 2018), Bangladesh, and the Philippines. It can cause encephalitis and pneumonia, and has a high case fatality rate. Nipah is a One Health zoonotic infectious disease linked to fruit bats, and sometimes pigs or horses. We advocate anticipating and preparing for urban and larger rural outbreaks of Nipah. Immediate enhanced preparations would include standardized guidance on infection prevention and control, and personal protective equipment, from the World Health Organization (WHO) on their OpenWHO website and 2018 "Managing Epidemics" handbook, along with adding best clinical practices by experts in countries with multiple outbreaks such as Bangladesh and India. Longer-term enhanced preparations include accelerating development of field diagnostics, antiviral drugs, immune-based therapies, and vaccines. WHO-coordinated multi-partner protocols to test investigational treatments, diagnostics, and vaccines are needed, by analogy to such protocols for Ebola during the unanticipated pan-epidemic in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Anticipating and preparing now for urban and rural Nipah outbreaks in nations with no experience with Nipah will help avoid the potential for what the United Nations 2016 report on Ebola in West Africa called a "preventable tragedy".

The human viral challenge model: accelerating the evaluation of respiratory antivirals, vaccines and novel diagnostics								RESPIRATORY RESEARCH				19						123	10.1186/s12931-018-0784-1				JUN 22 2018	2018	The Human Viral Challenge (HVC) model has, for many decades, helped in the understanding of respiratory viruses and their role in disease pathogenesis. In a controlled setting using small numbers of volunteers removed from community exposure to other infections, this experimental model enables proof of concept work to be undertaken on novel therapeutics, including vaccines, immunomodulators and antivirals, as well as new diagnostics.Crucially, unlike conventional phase 1 studies, challenge studies include evaluable efficacy endpoints that then guide decisions on how to optimise subsequent field studies, as recommended by the FDA and thus licensing studies that follow. Such a strategy optimises the benefit of the studies and identifies possible threats early on, minimising the risk to subsequent volunteers but also maximising the benefit of scarce resources available to the research group investing in the research. Inspired by the principles of the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) now commonly applied in the preclinical phase, HVC studies allow refinement and reduction of the subsequent development phase, accelerating progress towards further statistically powered phase 2b studies. The breadth of data generated from challenge studies allows for exploration of a wide range of variables and endpoints that can then be taken through to pivotal phase 3 studies.We describe the disease burden for acute respiratory viral infections for which current conventional development strategies have failed to produce therapeutics that meet clinical need. The Authors describe the HVC model's utility in increasing scientific understanding and in progressing promising therapeutics through development. The contribution of the model to the elucidation of the virus-host interaction, both regarding viral pathogenicity and the body's immunological response is discussed, along with its utility to assist in the development of novel diagnostics.Future applications of the model are also explored.

Intranasally (IN) delivered live-attenuated vaccines represent the most extensively studied approach for immunization of RSV-naive infants and children, however, achieving an effective balance of attenuation and immunogenicity has proven challenging. Here we report preclinical immunogenicity and efficacy data utilizing a live-attenuated vaccine candidate, RG.M2-2, which was obtained by deleting the M2-2 open reading frame from the genome of the MSA1 clinical isolate. Intramuscular (IM) administration of RG.M2-2 in cotton rats induced immunity and protective efficacy that was comparable to that induced by intranasal (IN) immunization. In contrast, the protective efficacy of RG.M2-2 delivered by the IM route to African green monkeys was substantially reduced as compared to the efficacy following IN administration, despite comparable levels of serum neutralizing antibodies. This result suggests that mucosal immunity may play an important role in RSV protection. The RG.M2-2 vaccine also demonstrated different attenuation profiles when tested in cotton rats, non-human primates, and a human airway epithelial (HAE) cell model. The data suggest RG.M2-2 is less attenuated than a similarly designed vaccine candidate constructed on the A2 genetic background. These findings have important implications with regard to both the design and the preclinical safety testing of live-attenuated vaccines.																					WOS:000435541300046	29920563

Maternal antibody and the maintenance of a lyssavirus in populations of seasonally breeding African bats								PLOS ONE				13	6					e0198563	10.1371/journal.pone.0198563				JUN 12 2018	2018	Pathogens causing acute disease and death or lasting immunity require specific spatial or temporal processes to persist in populations. Host traits, such as maternally-derived antibody (MDA) and seasonal birthing affect infection maintenance within populations. Our study objective is to understand how viral and host traits lead to population level infection persistence when the infection can be fatal. We collected data on African fruit bats and a rabies-related virus, Lagos bat virus (LBV), including through captive studies. We incorporate these data into a mechanistic model of LBV transmission to determine how host traits, including MDA and seasonal birthing, and viral traits, such as incubation periods, interact to allow fatal viruses to persist within bat populations. Captive bat studies supported MDA presence estimated from field data. Captive bat infection-derived antibody decayed more slowly than MDA, and while faster than estimates from the field, supports field data that suggest antibody persistence may be lifelong. Unobserved parameters were estimated by particle filtering and suggest only a small proportion of bats die of disease. Pathogen persistence in the population is sensitive to this proportion, along with MDA duration and incubation period. Our analyses suggest MDA produced bats and prolonged virus incubation periods allow viral maintenance in adverse conditions, such as a lethal pathogen or strongly seasonal resource availability for the pathogen in the form of seasonally pulsed birthing.

Current major targets are virus surface proteins, such as a fusion protein involved in viral entry, but agents effective after RSV infection is established are required. Here we have investigated the effects of late therapeutic intervention with a novel inhaled RSV polymerase inhibitor, PC786, on RSV infection in human airway epithelium.EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHAir liquid interface-cultured bronchial or small airway epithelium was infected with RSVA2. PC786 was applied apically or basolaterally once daily following peak virus load on Day 3 post inoculation. Apical wash was collected daily for determination of viral burden by PCR and plaque assay (primary endpoints) and biomarker analyses. The effects were compared with those of ALS-8112, an anti-RSV nucleoside analogue, and GS-5806, a fusion-protein inhibitor, which were treated basolaterally.KEY RESULTSLate intervention with GS-5806 did not show significant anti-viral effects, but PC786 produced potent, concentration-dependent inhibition of viral replication with viral load falling below detectable limits 3days after treatment commenced in airway epithelium. These effects were superior to those of ALS-8112. PC786 showed inhibitory activities against RSV-induced increases of CCL5, IL-6, double-strand DNA and mucin. The effects of PC786 were also confirmed in small airway epithelium.CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONSLate therapeutic intervention with the RSV polymerase inhibitor, PC786, reduced the viral burden quickly in human airway epithelium. Thus, PC786 demonstrates the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat active RSV infection.																					WOS:000434071600030	29579332

Culex flavivirus is an insect-specific flavivirus that naturally exists in field mosquito populations. The influence of Culex flavivirus on Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) vector competence of Culex pipiens has not been investigated.Methods: Culex flavivirus infection in a Cx. pipiens colony was studied by Culex flavivirus oral feeding and intrathoracical inoculation. Similarly, vector competence of Cx. pipiens infected with Culex flavivirus was evaluated for RVFV. Infection, dissemination, transmission rates and transmission efficiency of Culex flavivirus-infected and non-infected Cx. pipiens artificially fed with RVFV infected blood were assessed.Results: Culex flavivirus was able to infect Cx. pipiens after intrathoracically inoculation in Cx. pipiens mosquitos but not after Culex flavivirus oral feeding. Culex flavivirus did not affect RVFV infection, dissemination and transmission in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes. RVFV could be detected from saliva of both the Culex flavivirus-positive and negative Cx. pipiens females without significant differences. Moreover, RVFV did not interfere with the Culex flavivirus infection in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes.Conclusions: Culex flavivirus infected and non-infected Cx. pipiens transmit RVFV. Culex flavivirus existing in field-collected Cx. pipiens populations does not affect their vector competence for RVFV. Culex flavivirus may not be an efficient tool for RVFV control in mosquitoes.																					WOS:000433328000001	29792223

Cotton rat model for testing vaccines and antivirals against respiratory syncytial virus								Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy				26							10.1177/2040206618770518				MAY 16 2018	2018	Respiratory syncytial virus is the leading cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants and is a serious health risk for elderly and immunocompromised individuals. No vaccine has yet been approved to prevent respiratory syncytial virus infection and the only available treatment is immunoprophylaxis of severe respiratory syncytial virus disease in high-risk infants with Palivizumab (Synagis (R)). The development of respiratory syncytial virus vaccine has been hampered by the phenomenon of enhanced respiratory syncytial virus disease observed during trials of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus in 1960s. A search for effective respiratory syncytial virus therapeutics has been complicated by the fact that some of the most advanced respiratory syncytial virus antivirals, while highly effective in a prophylactic setting, had not demonstrated clinical efficacy when given after infection. A number of respiratory syncytial virus vaccines and antivirals are currently under development, including several vaccines proposed for maternal immunization. The cotton rat Sigmodon hispidus is an animal model of respiratory syncytial virus infection with demonstrated translational value. Special cohort scenarios, such as infection under conditions of immunosuppression and maternal immunization have been modeled in the cotton rat and are summarized here. In this review, we focus on the recent use of the cotton rat model for testing respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and therapeutic candidates in preclinical setting, including the use of special cohort models. An overview of published studies spanning the period of the last three years is provided. The emphasis, where possible, is made on candidates in the latest stages of preclinical development or currently in clinical trials.																					BCI:BCI201800558658	29768937

Although new direct acting antivirals have significantly improved the rate of HCV cure, high therapy cost, potential emergence of drug-resistant viral variants, and unavailability of a protective vaccine represent challenges for complete HCV eradication. Relevant animal models are required, and additional development remains necessary, to effectively study HCV biology, virus-host interactions and for the evaluation of new antiviral approaches and prophylactic vaccines. The chimpanzee, the only non-human primate susceptible to experimental HCV infection, has been used extensively to study HCV infection, particularly to analyze the innate and adaptive immune response upon infection. However, financial, practical, and especially ethical constraints have urged the exploration of alternative small animal models. These include different types of transgenic mice, immunodeficient mice of which the liver is engrafted with human hepatocytes (humanized mice) and, more recently, immunocompetent rodents that are susceptible to infection with viruses that are closely related to HCV. In this review, we provide an overview of the currently available animal models that have proven valuable for the study of HCV, and discuss their main benefits and weaknesses.

A novel method for strict intranasal delivery of non-replicating RSV vaccines in cotton rats and non-human primates								VACCINE				36	20			2876	2885		10.1016/j.vaccine.2018.02.110				MAY 11 2018	2018	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children twelve months of age or younger and a significant cause of lower respiratory disease in older adults. As various clinical and preclinical candidates advance, cotton rats (Sigmodon hispidus) and non-human primates (NHP) continue to play a valuable role in RSV vaccine development, since both animals are semi-permissive to human RSV (HRSV). However, appropriate utilization of the models is critical to avoid mis-interpretation of the preclinical findings. Using a multimodality imaging approach; a fluorescence based optical imaging technique for the cotton rat and a nuclear medicine based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging technique for monkeys, we demonstrate that many common practices for intranasal immunization in both species result in inoculum delivery to the lower respiratory tract, which can result in poor translation of outcomes from the preclinical to the clinical setting. Using these technologies we define a method to limit the distribution of intranasally administered vaccines solely to the upper airway of each species, which includes volume restrictions in combination with injectable anesthesia. We show using our newly defined methods for strict intranasal immunization that these methods impact the immune responses and efficacy observed when compared to vaccination methods resulting in distribution to both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. These data emphasize the importance of well-characterized immunization methods in the preclinical assessment of intranasally delivered vaccine candidates.

Viral communities are increasingly recognized as important although overlooked components of the human microbiota. It is unknown if the developing fetus is exposed to a community of viruses (virome). Given the debate over the existence of an intraamniotic microbial community and the importance of understanding how the infant gut is populated, we characterized the virome and bacterial microbiota of amniotic fluid from 24 uncomplicated term pregnancies using next-generation sequencing methods. Contrary to expectations, the bacterial microbiota of amniotic fluid was indistinguishable from contamination controls. Viral reads were sparse in the amniotic fluid, and we found no evidence of a core viral community across samples.																					WOS:000431899000001	29751830

Susceptibility of paramyxoviruses and filoviruses to inhibition by 2 '-monofluoro- and 2 '-difluoro-4 '-azidocytidine analogs								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				153				101	113		10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.03.009				MAY 2018	2018	Ebolaviruses, marburgviruses, and henipaviruses are zoonotic pathogens belonging to the Filoviridae and Paramyxoviridae families. They exemplify viruses that continue to spill over into the human population, causing outbreaks characterized by high mortality and significant clinical sequelae in survivors of infection. There are currently no approved small molecule therapeutics for use in humans against these viruses. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of the nucleoside analog 4'-azidocytidine (4'N-3-C, R1479) and its 2'-monofluoro- and 2'-difluoro-modified analogs (2'F-4'N-3-C and 2'diF-4'N-3-C) against representative paramyxoviruses (Nipah virus, Hendra virus, measles virus, and human parainfluenza virus 3) and filoviruses (Ebola virus, Sudan virus, and Ravn virus). We observed enhanced antiviral activity against paramyxoviruses with both 2'diF-4'N-3-C and 2'F-4'N-3-C compared to R1479. On the other hand, while R1479 and 2'diF-4'N-3-C inhibited filoviruses similarly to paramyxoviruses, we observed 10-fold lower filovirus inhibition by 2'F-4'N-3-C. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the susceptibility of paramyxoviruses and filoviruses to R1479 and its 2'-fluoro-modified analogs. The activity of these compounds against negative-strand RNA viruses endorses the development of 4'-modified nucleoside analogs as broad-spectrum therapeutics against zoonotic viruses of public health importance.

An in vitro transepithelial migration assay to evaluate the role of neutrophils in Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) induced epithelial damage								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						6777	10.1038/s41598-018-25167-4				APR 30 2018	2018	Large numbers of neutrophils migrate into the lungs of children with severe Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) disease. It is unclear how these cells contribute to viral clearance and recovery from infection or whether they contribute to disease pathology. We have developed a novel in vitro model to study neutrophil migration through airway epithelial cells (AECs), the main cellular target of RSV infection. Our model reproduces a physiologically relevant cell polarity and directionality of neutrophil migration. Using this model, we found that RSV infected AECs induced rapid neutrophil transepithelial migration. We also detected increased AEC damage associated with RSV infection, with a further increase in epithelial cells shedding from the Transwell membrane following neutrophil migration. This was not observed in the mock infected controls. Neutrophils that migrated through the RSV infected AECs showed increased cell surface expression of CD11B and MPO compared to neutrophils that had not migrated. In conclusion, our in vitro co-culture assay can be used to identify critical mechanisms that mediate epithelial cell damage and promote inflammation in children with severe RSV disease.

J	Fischer, Kerstin; Diederich, Sandra; Smith, Greg; Reiche, Sven; dos Reis, Vinicius Pinho; Stroh, Eileen; Groschup, Martin H.; Weingartl, Hana M.; Balkema-Buschmann, Anne								Indirect ELISA based on Hendra and Nipah virus proteins for the detection of henipavirus specific antibodies in pigs								PLOS ONE				13	4					e0194385	10.1371/journal.pone.0194385				APR 30 2018	2018	Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) belong to the genus Henipavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Henipavirus infections were first reported in the 1990's causing severe and often fatal outbreaks in domestic animals and humans in Southeast Asia and Australia. NiV infections were observed in humans in Bangladesh, India and in the first outbreak in Malaysia, where pigs were also infected. HeV infections occurred in horses in the North-Eastern regions of Australia, with singular transmission events to humans. Bats of the genus Pteropus have been identified as the reservoir hosts for henipaviruses. Molecular and serological indications for the presence of henipa-like viruses in African fruit bats, pigs and humans have been published recently. In our study, truncated forms of HeV and NiV attachment (G) proteins as well as the full-length NiV nucleocapsid (N) protein were expressed using different expression systems. Based on these recombinant proteins, Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assays (ELISA) were developed for the detection of HeV or NiV specific antibodies in porcine serum samples. We used the NiV N ELISA for initial serum screening considering the general reactivity against henipaviruses. The G protein based ELISAs enabled the differentiation between HeV and NiV infections, since as expected, the sera displayed higher reactivity with the respective homologous antigens. In the future, these assays will present valuable tools for serosurveillance of swine and possibly other livestock or wildlife species in affected areas. Such studies will help assessing the potential risk for human and animal health worldwide by elucidating the distribution of henipaviruses.																					WOS:000431130100005	29708971

Primary blood-hosts of mosquitoes are influenced by social and ecological conditions in a complex urban landscape								PARASITES & VECTORS				11						218	10.1186/s13071-018-2779-7				APR 10 2018	2018	Background: Temperate urban landscapes support persistent and growing populations of Culex and Aedes mosquito vectors. Large urban mosquito populations can represent a significant risk for transmission of emergent arboviral infection. However, even large mosquito populations are only a risk to the animals they bite. The purpose of this study is to identify and assess spatial patterns of host-use in a temperate urban landscape with heterogeneous socio-economic and ecological conditions.Results: Mosquito blood meals were collected from neighborhoods categorized along a socio-economic gradient in Baltimore, MD, USA. Blood meal hosts were identified for two Aedes (Ae. albopictus and Ae. japonicus) and three Culex (Cx. pipiens, Cx. restuans and Cx. salinarius) species. The brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) was the most frequently detected host in both Aedes species and Cx. salinarius. Human biting was evident in Aedes and Culex species and the proportion of human blood meals from Ae. albopictus varied significantly with neighborhood socio-economic status. Aedes albopictus was most likely to feed on human blood hosts (at 50%) in residential blocks categorized as having income above the city median, although there were still more total human bites detected from lower income blocks where Ae. albopictus was more abundant. Birds were the most frequently detected Culex blood hosts but were absent from all Aedes sampled.Conclusions: This study highlights fine-scale variation in host-use by medically important mosquito vectors and specifically investigates blood meal composition at spatial scales relevant to urban mosquito dispersal and human exposure. Further, the work emphasizes the importance of neighborhood economics and infrastructure management in shaping both the relative abundance of vectors and local blood feeding strategies. The invasive brown rat was an important blood source across vector species and neighborhoods in Baltimore. We show that social and economic conditions can be important predictors of transmission potential in urban landscapes and identify important questions about the role of rodents in supporting urban mosquito populations.

Human Pegivirus: Pathogenic potential and non-Hodgkin lymphoma development risk								REVISTA CHILENA DE INFECTOLOGIA				35	2			164	175		10.4067/s0716-10182018000200164				APR 2018	2018	The human pegivirus (HPgV), classified in the Flaviviridae family -Pegivirus genus, is an RNA virus identified in 1995. HPgV is a lymphotrophic virus, with replication sites in bone marrow and lymphoid tissue, as well as in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Transmission is through sexual and parenteral routes, and recent estimations suggest nearly 750 million people are infected with HPgV worldwide. Almost 25% of infected individuals can develop persistent infection. Until now, HPgV has been considered a non-pathogenic virus; however, epidemiological studies suggest a potential role in lymphoproliferative diseases, particularly in the development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The evidence of this is controversial and the role of HPgV in lymphomagenesis has not yet been demonstrated. Several studies report a high prevalence of HPgV infection in patients with NHL compared to controls and patients with other hematological diseases. Therefore, analytic studies show that HPgV could be related to an increased risk of NHL development. Conversely, other studies indicate no association between HPgV and NHL, so the role of HPgV in lymphomagenesis is not clear. This review summarizes the main findings related to HPgV's pathogenic potential and association with NHL.																					WOS:000434006500008	29912254

Rescue and characterization of recombinant cedar virus, a non-pathogenic Henipavirus species								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				15						56	10.1186/s12985-018-0964-0				MAR 27 2018	2018	Background: Hendra virus and Nipah virus are zoonotic viruses that have caused severe to fatal disease in livestock and human populations. The isolation of Cedar virus, a non-pathogenic virus species in the genus Henipavirus, closely-related to the highly pathogenic Hendra virus and Nipah virus offers an opportunity to investigate differences in pathogenesis and receptor tropism among these viruses.Methods: We constructed full-length cDNA clones of Cedar virus from synthetic oligonucleotides and rescued two replication-competent, recombinant Cedar virus variants: a recombinant wild-type Cedar virus and a recombinant Cedar virus that expresses a green fluorescent protein from an open reading frame inserted between the phosphoprotein and matrix genes. Replication kinetics of both viruses and stimulation of the interferon pathway were characterized in vitro. Cellular tropism for ephrin-B type ligands was qualitatively investigated by microscopy and quantitatively by a split-luciferase fusion assay.Results: Successful rescue of recombinant Cedar virus expressing a green fluorescent protein did not significantly affect virus replication compared to the recombinant wild-type Cedar virus. We demonstrated that recombinant Cedar virus stimulated the interferon pathway and utilized the established Hendra virus and Nipah virus receptor, ephrin-B2, but not ephrin-B3 to mediate virus entry. We further characterized virus-mediated membrane fusion kinetics of Cedar virus with the known henipavirus receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3.Conclusions: The recombinant Cedar virus platform may be utilized to characterize the determinants of pathogenesis across the henipaviruses, investigate their receptor tropisms, and identify novel pan-henipavirus antivirals. Moreover, these experiments can be conducted safely under BSL-2 conditions.																					WOS:000428543300006	29587789

Consensus and conflict among ecological forecasts of Zika virus outbreaks in the United States								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						4921	10.1038/s41598-018-22989-0				MAR 21 2018	2018	Ecologists are increasingly involved in the pandemic prediction process. In the course of the Zika outbreak in the Americas, several ecological models were developed to forecast the potential global distribution of the disease. Conflicting results produced by alternative methods are unresolved, hindering the development of appropriate public health forecasts. We compare ecological niche models and experimentally-driven mechanistic forecasts for Zika transmission in the continental United States. We use generic and uninformed stochastic county-level simulations to demonstrate the downstream epidemiological consequences of conflict among ecological models, and show how assumptions and parameterization in the ecological and epidemiological models propagate uncertainty and produce downstream model conflict. We conclude by proposing a basic consensus method that could resolve conflicting models of potential outbreak geography and seasonality. Our results illustrate the usually-undocumented margin of uncertainty that could emerge from using any one of these predictions without reservation or qualification. In the short term, ecologists face the task of developing better post hoc consensus that accurately forecasts spatial patterns of Zika virus outbreaks. Ultimately, methods are needed that bridge the gap between ecological and epidemiological approaches to predicting transmission and realistically capture both outbreak size and geography.

Currently, in vivo studies of bats are hampered due to their low reproduction rates. To overcome this, we transplanted bat cells from bone marrow (BM) and spleen into an immunodeficient mouse strain NOD-scid IL-2R(-/-) (NSG), and have successfully established stable, long-term reconstitution of bat immune cells in mice (bat-mice). Immune functionality of our bat-mouse model was demonstrated through generation of antigen-specific antibody response by bat cells following immunization. Post-engraftment of total bat BM cells and splenocytes, bat immune cells survived, expanded and repopulated the mouse without any observable clinical abnormalities. Utilizing bat's remarkable immunological functions, this novel model has a potential to be transformed into a powerful platform for basic and translational research.

J	Banerjee, Arinjay; Misra, Vikram; Schountz, Tony; Baker, Michelle L.								Tools to study pathogen-host interactions in bats								VIRUS RESEARCH				248				5	12		10.1016/j.virusres.2018.02.013				MAR 15 2018	2018	Bats are natural reservoirs for a variety of emerging viruses that cause significant disease in humans and domestic animals yet rarely cause clinical disease in bats. The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.

In addition to cytosolic DNA generated by these viral infections, the metabolic demands of flight cause DNA damage and the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm. However, whether bats have an altered DNA sensing/defense system to balance high cytosolic DNA levels remains an open question. We demonstrate that bats have a dampened interferon response due to the replacement of the highly conserved serine residue (S358) in STING, an essential adaptor protein in multiple DNA sensing pathways. Reversing this mutation by introducing S358 restored STING functionality, resulting in interferon activation and virus inhibition. Combined with previous reports on bat-specific changes of other DNA sensors such as TLR9, IFI16, and AIM2, our findings shed light on bat adaptation to flight, their long lifespan, and their unique capacity to serve as a virus reservoir.

Role of monkeys in the sylvatic cycle of chikungunya virus in Senegal								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				9						1046	10.1038/s41467-018-03332-7				MAR 13 2018	2018	Arboviruses spillover into humans either as a one-step jump from a reservoir host species into humans or as a two-step jump from the reservoir to an amplification host species and thence to humans. Little is known about arbovirus transmission dynamics in reservoir and amplification hosts. Here we elucidate the role of monkeys in the sylvatic, enzootic cycle of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the region around Kedougou, Senegal. Over 3 years, 737 monkeys were captured, aged using anthropometry and dentition, and tested for exposure to CHIKV by detection of neutralizing antibodies. Infant monkeys were positive for CHIKV even when the virus was not detected in a concurrent survey of mosquitoes and when population immunity was too high for monkeys alone to support continuous transmission. We conclude that monkeys in this region serve as amplification hosts of CHIKV. Additional efforts are needed to identify other hosts capable of supporting continuous circulation.

Secondarily, to compare laryngeal anatomy of the ferret with rat and rabbit.Materials and Methods: The larynges of 18 male ferrets were prepared by unilateral scarring, and normal larynges from 6 female Wistar rats and 5 male albino rabbits were used for comparative purposes. For scarring, the right VF were electrocauterized, ablating the entire LP. Prior to harvesting the larynges at 4 and 16 weeks, each ferret was re-anesthetized, and in 3 animals, India ink was injected into the LPs of both normal and scarred VFs.Results: Laryngoscopic methods and instrumentation for precise visualization, scarring, and injection were developed. The scarred VFs had reduced hyaluronic acid and increased collagen type I, III, and fibronectin compared with normal VFs. The 2 timepoints (4 and 16 weeks) differed significantly only in collagen type III level (levels were higher at 4 weeks). Injected ink migrated from scarred LP to muscle layer just beneath the scarred tissue 3 hours after injection.Conclusion: The ferret is a promising species for creation and experimental treatment of vocal fold scar.

To characterize the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection in vivo, we performed experimental infections in ferrets followed by genome-wide gene expression analysis of lung and brain tissues. The Hendra, Nipah-Bangladesh, and Nipah-Malaysia strains caused severe respiratory and neurological disease with animals succumbing around 7 days post infection. Despite the presence of abundant viral shedding, animal-to-animal transmission did not occur. The host gene expression profiles of the lung tissue showed early activation of interferon responses and subsequent expression of inflammation-related genes that coincided with the clinical deterioration. Additionally, the lung tissue showed unchanged levels of lymphocyte markers and progressive downregulation of cell cycle genes and extracellular matrix components. Infection in the brain resulted in a limited breadth of the host responses, which is in accordance with the immunoprivileged status of this organ. Finally, we propose a model of the pathogenic mechanisms of henipavirus infection that integrates multiple components of the host responses.																					WOS:000431268900064	29538374	
J	Orlova, M. V.; Kononova, Yu. V.								PATHOGENS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC BAT ECTOPARASITES (CHIROPTERA) (A REVIEW OF LITERARY DATA)								Parazitologiya (St. Petersburg)				52	2			137	153						MAR-APR 2018	2018	The order Chiroptera comprises more than 1.300 species that are hosts for more than 1.000 species of ticks and mites and of about 700 insect species; many of these parasites are involved in circulation of numerous pathogens. The present paper presents the first and most complicated review of literature on pathogens associated with bat ectoparasites.Specific bat ectoparasites can be vectors of a wide spectrum of bacterial pathogens (Borrelia, Bartonella, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia), a number of protozoan (hemosporidia, Babesia) and virus (tick-borne encephalitis virus, Issyk-Kul virus and other) pathogens, and also nematodes (filaria). Bacterial and viral pathogens are distributed among ectoparasites of bats not uniformly. The bacterium Bartonella sp. was the microorganism most frequently isolated from blood-sucking arthropods; different strains of this pathogen were separated from all groups of studied ectoparasites; Bartonella sp. was the only causative agent associated with bat flies streblids and ixodid ticks. Bat fleas are vectors of only two pathogens (Rickettsia helvetica and Bartonella sp.). Bacteria Borrelia sp., Coxiella sp., Anaplasma sp., and Ehrlichia sp. were isolated only from parasitic ticks and mites. Viruses isolated from insects (nycteribiids, bat bugs) and argasid mites are represented mainly by representatives of the families Bunyaviridae and Rhabdoviridae. Protozoans are represented by sporozoan parasites of the orders Piroplasmida and Haemosporida. The DNA of the filarial worm was isolated from a gamasid mite belonging to the family Spin-turnicidae. Representatives of the most common and widespread families of bats (Vespertilionidae, Phyllostomidae, and Pteropodidae) are hosts of the majority of ectoparasites from which pathogens were isolated.The ability of some bat ectoparasites to reproduce during host hibernation makes the transmission of microorganisms in the winter possible.For the territories of the former USSR, a few number of pathogens associated with bat parasites are known (e.g. Issyk-Kul virus, TBE virus). For the territory of Russian Federation, such data are absent.																					BCI:BCI201800553769

Gammaherpesviruses are of interest because of their long term infection of lymphoid cells and their potential to cause cancer. Here, we report the characterization of a novel bat herpesvirus isolated from a big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus) in Canada. The genome of the virus, tentatively named Eptesicus fuscus herpesvirus (EfHV), is 166,748 base pairs. Phylogenetically EfHV is a member of Gammaherpesvirinae, in which it belongs to the Genus Rhadinovirus and is closely related to other bat Gammaherpesviruses. In contrast to other known Gammaherpesviruses, the EfFIV genome contains coding sequences similar to those of class I and II host major histocompatibility antigens. The virus is capable of infecting and replicating in human, monkey, cat and pig cell lines. Although we detected EfHV in 20 of 28 big brown bats tested, these bats lacked neutralizing antibodies against the virus.																					WOS:000428004800024	29407381

Pathogenesis of bat rabies in a natural reservoir: Comparative susceptibility of the straw-colored fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) to three strains of Lagos bat virus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				12	3					e0006311	10.1371/journal.pntd.0006311				MAR 2018	2018	Rabies is a fatal neurologic disease caused by lyssavirus infection. People are infected through contact with infected animals. The relative increase of human rabies acquired from bats calls for a better understanding of lyssavirus infections in their natural hosts. So far, there is no experimental model that mimics natural lyssavirus infection in the reservoir bat species. Lagos bat virus is a lyssavirus that is endemic in straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) in Africa. Here we compared the susceptibility of these bats to three strains of Lagos bat virus (from Senegal, Nigeria, and Ghana) by intracranial inoculation. To allow comparison between strains, we ensured the same titer of virus was inoculated in the same location of the brain of each bat. All bats (n = 3 per strain) were infected, and developed neurological signs, and fatal meningoencephalitis with lyssavirus antigen expression in neurons. There were three main differences among the groups. First, time to death was substantially shorter in the Senegal and Ghana groups (4 to 6 days) than in the Nigeria group (8 days). Second, each virus strain produced a distinct clinical syndrome. Third, the spread of virus to peripheral tissues, tested by hemi-nested reverse transcriptase PCR, was frequent (3 of 3 bats) and widespread (8 to 10 tissues positive of 11 tissues examined) in the Ghana group, was frequent and less widespread in the Senegal group (3/3 bats, 3 to 6 tissues positive), and was rare and restricted in the Nigeria group (1/3 bats, 2 tissues positive). Centrifugal spread of virus from brain to tissue of excretion in the oral cavity is required to enable lyssavirus transmission. Therefore, the Senegal and Ghana strains seem most suitable for further pathogenesis, and for transmission, studies in the straw-colored fruit bat.																					WOS:000431268900041	29505617

The envelope attachment glycoprotein (G) of Nipah virus plays a key role in viral entry and induction of neutralizing antibody in mammalian hosts, thus is considered a good candidate for vaccine development. Plant transient expression systems are gaining recognition as a viable alternative for the production of vaccine antigens. In this study, we expressed the Nipah virus G protein heterologously in Nicotiana benthamiana using an agroinfiltration approach. The highest expression of recombinant G protein in N. benthamiana at RNA and protein levels was detected on day 9 post-infiltration. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the purified G protein reacted specifically with rabbit anti-Nipah Virus serum, indicating its potential for vaccine use.

The aim of this study was to investigate the exposure history of Ugandan bats to a panel of arboviruses.Materials and methods: Insectivorous and fruit bats were captured from multiple locations throughout Uganda during 2009 and 2011-2013. All serum samples were tested for neutralizing antibodies against West Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), Zika virus (ZIKV), Babanki virus (BBKV), and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Sera from up to 626 bats were screened for antibodies against each virus.Results and Discussion:Key findings include the presence of neutralizing antibodies against RVFV in 5/52 (9.6%) of little epauletted fruit bats (Epomophorus labiatus) captured from Kawuku and 3/54 (5.6%) Egyptian rousette bats from Kasokero cave. Antibodies reactive to flaviviruses were widespread across bat taxa and sampling locations.Conclusion: The data presented demonstrate the widespread exposure of bats in Uganda to arboviruses, and highlight particular virus-bat associations that warrant further investigation.

Adult sheep of both sexes were challenged 12 weeks after the last immunization and clinical, virological, biochemical and immunological consequences, were analyzed. Strategies based on immunization with homologous DNA or heterologous DNA/MVA prime-boost were able to induce a rapid in vitro neutralizing antibody response as well as IFN gamma production after in vitro virus specific re-stimulation. In these animals we observed reduced viremia levels and less clinical signs when compared with mock-immunized controls. In contrast, sheep inoculated with a homologous MVA prime-boost showed increased viremia correlating with the absence of detectable neutralizing antibody responses, despite of inducing cellular responses after the last immunization. However, faster induction of neutralizing antibodies and IFN gamma production after challenge were found in this group when compared to the mock vaccinated group, indicative of a primed immune response. In conclusion, these results suggest that vaccination strategies based on DNA priming were able to mount and maintain specific anti-RVFV glycoprotein immune responses upon homologous or heterologous booster doses, warranting further optimization in large animal models of infection.

Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy.Methods: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol.Results: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5'). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats.Conclusions: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus. Genome organization and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that VAPV should be considered a novel species within the genus Ledantevirus for which viral ecology and disease associations should be investigated.

Pathogenesis, Humoral Immune Responses, and Transmission between Cohoused Animals in a Ferret Model of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				92	4					e01322-17	10.1128/JVI.01322-17				FEB 2018	2018	Small-animal models have been used to obtain many insights regarding the pathogenesis and immune responses induced following infection with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Among those described to date, infections in cotton rats, mice, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and Syrian hamsters with hRSV strains Long and/or A2 have been well characterized, although clinical isolates have also been examined. Ferrets are also susceptible to hRSV infection, but the pathogenesis and immune responses elicited following infection have not been well characterized. Here, we describe the infection of adult ferrets with hRSV Long or A2 via the intranasal route and characterized virus replication, as well as cytokine induction, in the upper and lower airways. Virus replication and cytokine induction during the acute phase of infection (days 0 to 15 postinfection) were similar between the two strains, and both elicited high levels of F glycoprotein-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies following virus clearance (days 16 to 22 postinfection). Importantly, we demonstrate transmission from experimentally infected donor ferrets to co-housed naive recipients and have characterized virus replication and cytokine induction in the upper airways of infected contact animals. Together, these studies provide a direct comparison of the pathogenesis of hRSV Long and A2 in ferrets and highlight the potential of this animal model to study serological responses and examine interventions that limit transmission of hRSV.IMPORTANCE Ferrets have been widely used to study pathogenesis, immunity, and transmission following human influenza virus infections; however, far less is known regarding the utility of the ferret model to study hRSV infections. Following intranasal infection of adult ferrets with the well-characterized Long or A2 strain of hRSV, we report virus replication and cytokine induction in the upper and lower airways, as well as the development of virus-specific humoral responses. Importantly, we demonstrate transmission of hRSV from experimentally infected donor ferrets to co-housed naive recipients. Together, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the utility of the ferret as a small-animal model to investigate aspects of hRSV pathogenesis and immunity.

The lyssavirus host-specificity conundrum - rabies virus - the exception not the rule								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				28				68	73		10.1016/j.coviro.2017.11.007				FEB 2018	2018	Lyssaviruses are a diverse range of viruses which all cause the disease rabies. Of the 16 recognized species, only rabies viruses (RABV) have multiple host reservoirs. Although lyssaviruses are capable of infecting all mammals, onward transmission in a new host population requires adaptation of the virus, in a number of stages with both host and virus factors determining the outcome. Due to an absence of recorded non-RABV host shifts, RABV data is extrapolated to draw conclusions for all lyssaviruses. In this article, we have focused on evidence of host shifts in the same insectivorous bat reservoir species in North America (RABV) and Europe (EBLV-1, EBLV-2 and BBLV). How RABV has successfully crossed species barriers and established infectious cycles in new hosts to be the global multi-host pathogen it is today, whilst other lyssaviruses appear restricted in host species is explored in this review. It hypothesized that RABV is the exception, rather than the rule, in this fascinating genus of viruses.																					WOS:000427665300012	29182939

Inter-epidemic Rift Valley fever virus seroconversions in an irrigation scheme in Bura, south-east Kenya								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				65	1			e55	e62		10.1111/tbed.12674				FEB 2018	2018	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute mosquito-borne viral zoonosis whose outbreaks are often associated with prolonged rainfall and flooding, during which large numbers of vectors emerge. Recent studies into the inter-epidemic maintenance of RVF virus (RVFV) suggest that both vertical transmission in vectors and direct transmission between hosts act in combination with predisposing factors for persistence of the virus. A comparative longitudinal survey was carried out in Tana River County, Kenya, in irrigated, riverine and pastoral ecosystems from September 2014-June 2015. The objectives were to investigate the possibility of low-level RVFV transmission in these ecosystems during an inter-epidemic period (IEP), examine variations in RVFV seroprevalence in sheep and goats and determine the risk factors for transmission. Three hundred and sixteen small ruminants were selected and tested for immunoglobulin G antibodies against RVFV nucleoprotein using a competitive ELISA during six visits. Data on potential risk factors were also captured. Inter-epidemic RVFV transmission was evidenced by 15 seroconversions within the irrigated and riverine villages. The number of seroconversions was not significantly different (OR=0.66, CI=0.19-2.17, p=.59) between irrigated and riverine areas. No seroconversions were detected in the pastoral ecosystem. This study highlights the increased risk of inter-epidemic RVFV transmission posed by irrigation, through provision of necessary environmental conditions that enable vectors access to more breeding grounds, resting places and shade, which favour their breeding and survival.

Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Targeting the G Protein Provides a New Approach for an Old Problem								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				92	3					e01302-17	10.1128/JVI.01302-17				FEB 2018	2018	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) annually affecting >2 million children in the United States <5 years old. In the elderly (>65 years old), RSV results in similar to 175,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States with a worldwide incidence of similar to 34 million. There is no approved RSV vaccine, and treatments are limited. Recently, a phase 3 trial in the elderly using a recombinant RSV F protein vaccine failed to meet its efficacy objectives, namely, prevention of moderate-to-severe RSV-associated LRTI and reduced incidence of acute respiratory disease. Moreover, a recent phase 3 trial evaluating suptavumab (REGN2222), an antibody to RSV F protein, did not meet its primary endpoint of preventing medically attended RSV infections in preterm infants. Despite these setbacks, numerous efforts targeting the RSV F protein with vaccines, antibodies, and small molecules continue based on the commercial success of a monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the RSV F protein (palivizumab). As the understanding of RSV biology has improved, the other major coat protein, the RSV G protein, has reemerged as an alternative target reflecting progress in understanding its roles in infecting bronchial epithelial cells and in altering the host immune response. In mouse models, a high-affinity, strain-independent human MAb to the RSV G protein has shown potent direct antiviral activity combined with the alleviation of virus-induced immune system effects that contribute to disease pathology. This MAb, being prepared for clinical trials, provides a qualitatively new approach to managing RSV for populations not eligible for prophylaxis with palivizumab.

Hendra and Nipah virus are two henipaviruses known to cause severe disease in humans with a high case-fatality rate. Pteropid spp. bats are the natural reservoir of Hendra and Nipah virus. From these bats, virus can be transmitted to an amplifying host, horses and pigs, and from these hosts to humans, or the virus can be transmitted directly to humans. Although the main route of shedding varies between host species, close contact is required for transmission in all hosts. Understanding the transmission routes of Hendra and Nipah virus in their respective hosts is essential for devising strategies to block zoonotic transmission.

WEST NILE VIRUS HUMAN INFECTIONS - A RE-EMERGING VECTOR BORN DISEASE IN THE SOUTH EAST OF ROMANIA								JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND ECOLOGY				19	1			392	399						2018	2018	The infection with West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging disease related to mosquito bite. Most cases are asymptomatic or unspecified fever self-limited within 3-6 days. Less than 1% of WNV are meningo-encephalitis. Mortality varies between 4 and 29%. In the EU, WNV is a notifiable disease, based on the case definition. During 2016 epidemic, the majority from 214 cases reported in UE originate from Romania, Italy and Hungary. This retrospective study is a descriptive analysis of WNV meningo-encephalitis reported during 2016 in Galati-Braila region. The data were collected from the medical reports of infectious diseases departments, according to the case definition. Laboratory diagnosis was based on the identification of WNV immunoglobulin M antibody (IgM). There are reported 25 cases of WNV meningo-encephalitis from Galati-Braila region. Demographic characteristics evidenced prevalence of urban living, median age over 60, and no difference by gender and frequent age-related co-morbidities. One in 25 patients died. The molecular diagnosis was performed in a single patient and proved WNV-strain from genetic line 2, not previously reported in Romania. We concluded that Galati-Braila region is a high risk area for re-emerging WNV. Active epidemiologic surveillance of vector born diseases and multidisciplinary research programs should limit the epidemics in the coming years.																					WOS:000430319500042

Reptiles and Amphibians as Potential Reservoir Hosts of Chikungunya Virus								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				98	3			841	844		10.4269/ajtmh.17-0730				2018	2018	Chikungunya virus is an emerging arbovirus of significant human-health concern. Little is known about its sylvatic cycle, including whether ectothermic vertebrates are permissive to infection. In this study, individuals from ten species of reptiles and amphibians were inoculated with chikungunya virus and samples of blood were tested to characterize viremia and seroconversion. Viremia was not detected in cane toads, house geckos, or American alligators, but most of the green iguanas, red-eared sliders, ball and Burmese pythons, leopard frogs, Texas toads, and garter snakes developed viremia. Peak virus titers in serum of up to 4.5, 4.7, and 5.1 log(10) plaque-forming units per milliliter were observed for garter snakes, ball pythons, and Texas toads, respectively. These results add to those of other studies that have suggested a possible role for ectothermic vertebrates in the ecology of arbovirus maintenance and transmission in nature.

As biological research is a complex, intricate, diverse field, any available support is gladly taken. With recent outbreaks and epidemics, pathogens are a constant threat to the global economy and security. Virus related plagues are somehow the most difficult to handle. Biocomputation has provided appreciable help in resolving clinical virology related issues. This review, for the first time, surveys the current status of the role of computation in virus related research. Advances made in the fields of clinical virology, antiviral drug design, viral immunology and viral oncology, through input from biocomputation, have been discussed. The amount of progress made and the software platforms available are consolidated in this review. The limitations of computation based methods are presented. Finally, the challenges facing the future of biocomputation in clinical virology are speculated upon.																					WOS:000435822200035	35539262

Transmission of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus in the Immunocompromised Ferret Model								VIRUSES-BASEL				10	1					18	10.3390/v10010018				JAN 2018	2018	Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) causes substantial morbidity and mortality in vulnerable patients, such as the very young, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals of any age. Nosocomial transmission of HRSV remains a serious challenge in hospital settings, with intervention strategies largely limited to infection control measures, including isolation of cases, high standards of hand hygiene, cohort nursing, and use of personal protective equipment. No vaccines against HRSV are currently available, and treatment options are largely supportive care and expensive monoclonal antibody or antiviral therapy. The limitations of current animal models for HRSV infection impede the development of new preventive and therapeutic agents, and the assessment of their potential for limiting HRSV transmission, in particular in nosocomial settings. Here, we demonstrate the efficient transmission of HRSV from immunocompromised ferrets to both immunocompromised and immunocompetent contact ferrets, with pathological findings reproducing HRSV pathology in humans. The immunocompromised ferret-HRSV model represents a novel tool for the evaluation of intervention strategies against nosocomial transmission of HRSV.

Molecular Epidemiology and Evolution of European Bat Lyssavirus 2								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES				19	1					156	10.3390/ijms19010156				JAN 2018	2018	Bat rabies cases in Europe are mainly attributed to two lyssaviruses, namely European Bat Lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1) and European Bat Lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2). Prior to the death of a bat worker in Finland in 1985, very few bat rabies cases were reported. Enhanced surveillance in the two subsequent years (1986-1987) identified 263 cases (more than a fifth of all reported cases to date). Between 1977 and 2016, 1183 cases of bat rabies were reported, with the vast majority (>97%) being attributed to EBLV-1. In contrast, there have been only 39 suspected cases of EBLV-2, of which 34 have been confirmed by virus typing and presently restricted to just two bat species; Myotis daubentonii and Myotis dasycneme. The limited number of EBLV-2 cases in Europe prompted the establishment of a network of European reference laboratories to collate all available viruses and data. Despite the relatively low number of EBLV-2 cases, a large amount of anomalous data has been published in the scientific literature, which we have here reviewed and clarified. In this review, 29 EBLV-2 full genome sequences have been analysed to further our understanding of the diversity and molecular evolution of EBLV-2 in Europe. Analysis of the 29 complete EBLV-2 genome sequences clearly corroborated geographical relationships with all EBLV-2 sequences clustering at the country level irrespective of the gene studied. Further geographical clustering was also observed at a local level. There are high levels of homogeneity within the EBLV-2 species with nucleotide identities ranging from 95.5-100% and amino acid identities between 98.7% and 100%, despite the widespread distribution of the isolates both geographically and chronologically. The mean substitution rate for EBLV-2 across the five concatenated genes was 1.65 x 10(-5), and evolutionary clock analysis confirms the slow evolution of EBLV-2 both between and within countries in Europe. This is further supported by the first detailed EBLV-2 intra-roost genomic analysis whereby a relatively high sequence homogeneity was found across the genomes of three EBLV-2 isolates obtained several years apart (2007, 2008, and 2014) from M. daubentonii at the same site (Stokesay Castle, Shropshire, UK).

We did not detect viremia in hamsters inoculated subcutaneously with either virus strain, although some hamsters developed virus neutralizing antibodies. However, we detected statistically significant higher viremias (P = 0.0285) and a higher median neutralization titer (P = 0.0163) in hamsters inoculated intraperitoneally with strain ArD 41525 compared with strain CPC-0740. Furthermore, some hamsters inoculated with strain ArD 41525 displayed mild signs of disease. By contrast, strain 13 guinea pigs inoculated intraperitoneally with either strain did not have detectable viremias and less than half developed virus neutralizing antibodies. Our results support the use of the Syrian golden hamster intraperitoneal model to explore phenotypic variation between ZIKV strains.																					WOS:000430952800041	29405107

Limited antigenic variability of CHIKV and ZIKV may restrict urban transmission cycles due to population protective immunity. In Africa, sylvatic transmission cycles involving nonhuman primates (NHP) are known for CHIKV and ZIKV, causing cyclic reemergence in humans. To evaluate whether sylvatic cycles can be expected in Latin America, we tested 207 NHP collected between 2012 and 2017 in urban and pen-urban settings in Brazil for infection with ZIKV and CHIKV. No animal tested positive for viral RNA in genus-specific and species-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays. In contrast, six animals (2.9%) from the families Atelidae, Callitrichidae, and Cebidae showed ZIKV-specific antibodies and 11 (5.3%) showed CHIKVspecific antibodies in plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT). Reactivity was monotypic against either ZIKV or CHIKV in all cases, opposing unspecific virucidal activity of sera. PRNT endpoint titers were low at 1:40 in all NHP, and positive specimens did not correspond to the likely dispersal route and time of introduction of both arboviruses. All antibody-positive samples were therefore tested against the NHP-associated yellow fever virus (YFV) and Mayaro virus (MAYV) and against the human-associated dengue virus (DENV) by PRNT. Two ZIKV-positive samples were simultaneously DENV positive and two CHIKV-positive samples were simultaneously MAW positive, at titers of 1:40 to 1:160. This suggested cross-reactive antibodies against heterologous alphaviruses and flaviviruses in 24% of ZIKV-positive/CHIKVpositive sera. In sum, low seroprevalence, invariably low antibody titers, and the distribution of positive specimens call into question the capability of ZIKV and CHIKV to infect New World NHP and establish sylvatic transmission cycles.IMPORTANCE Since 2013, Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have infected millions of people in the Americas via urban transmission cycles. Nonhuman primates (NHP) are involved in sylvatic transmission cycles maintaining ZIKV and CHIKV in the Old World. We tested NHP sampled during 2012 to 2017 in urban and peri-urban areas severely affected by ZIKV and CHIKV in Brazil. Seroprevalence and antibody titers were low for both viruses. Additionally, we found evidence for infection by heterologous viruses eliciting cross-reactive antibodies. Our data suggest that urban or peri-urban NHP are not easily infected by ZIKV and CHIKV despite intense local transmission. These data may imply that the ZIKV and CHIKV outbreaks in the Americas cannot be sustained in urban or peri-urban NHP once human population immunity limits urban transmission cycles. Investigation of diverse animals is urgently required to determine the fate of the ZIKV and CHIKV outbreaks in the Americas.																					WOS:000425277500024

Furthermore, mosquito feeding may also result in pathogen transmission between livestock reservoirs (epizootics) and incidentally humans (zoonotic diseases). Not all mosquito species are disease vectors and not all individuals within a species will become infected post exposure and these important differences between mosquito genera and species are discussed. The epidemiology (hosts, environment, pathogen, and mosquito vectors) of most significant and frequent pathogens are explained, with particular emphasis on the viruses Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile, and the equine encephalitis (Western equine, Eastern equine, and Venezuelan equine). Increased globalization and anthropogenic landscape modification has resulted in widespread emergence and re-emergence of pathogens in old and new habitats. Furthermore, viral adaptation and global climate change will place more animal and human populations at risk of these pathogens.																					WOS:000568600200008

Powassan Virus and Other Arthropod-Borne Viruses in Wildlife and Ticks in Ontario, Canada								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				99	2			458	465		10.4269/ajtmh.18-0098				2018	2018	Powassan virus (POWV) is a tick-borne zoonosis maintained in natural enzootic cycles between ixodid ticks and wild mammals. Reported human cases have increased in recent years; these infections can be fatal or lead to long-term neurologic sequelae. However, both the geographic distribution and the role of common, potential mammalian hosts in POWV transmission are poorly understood, creating challenges to public health surveillance. We looked for evidence of POWV infection among candidate wildlife host species and ticks collected from mammals and birds in southern Ontario. Tissues (including blood) and ticks from trapped wild mammals were collected in the summers of 2015 and 2016. Ticks removed from dogs in 2015-2016 and wildlife diagnostic cases from 2011 to 2013 were also included. Tissue and tick (Ixodes spp.) homogenates were tested for POWV by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, sera from wild mammals were tested for antibodies to POWV, West Nile virus (WNV), and heartland virus (HRTV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. All 724 tissue samples were negative for POWV by RT-PCR. One of 53 pools of Ixodes cookei (among 98 total tick pools) was RT-PCR positive for deer tick virus (POWV) lineage. Antibodies to POWV and WNV were detected in 0.4% of 265 and 6.1% of 264 samples, respectively, and all of 219 serum samples tested negative for anti-HRTV antibodies. These results reveal low POWV detection rates in southern Ontario, while highlighting the challenges and need for continued efforts into understanding POWV epidemiology and targeted surveillance strategies.

For instance, skew analysis of the nucleotide bias of several viral RNA genomes indicated that it is enriched in the unpaired, single-stranded genome regions, thus creating an even more striking virus-specific signature. The comparison of skew graphs for many virus isolates or families is difficult, time-consuming, and nonquantitative. Here, we present a procedure for a more simple identification of similarities and dissimilarities between nucleotide skew data of coronavirus, flavivirus, picornavirus, and HIV-1 RNA genomes. Window and step sizes were normalized to correct for differences in length of the viral genome. Cumulative skew data are converted into pairwise Euclidean distance matrices, which can be presented as neighbor-joining trees. We present skew value trees for the four virus families and show that closely related viruses are placed in small clusters. Importantly, the skew value trees are similar to the trees constructed by a "classical" model of evolutionary nucleotide substitution. Thus, we conclude that the simple calculation of Euclidean distances between nucleotide skew data allows an easy and quantitative comparison of characteristic sequence signatures of virus genomes. These results indicate that the Euclidean distance analysis of nucleotide skew data forms a nice addition to the virology toolbox.																					WOS:000449911900001	30510593

Modes of Transmission of Zika Virus								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				216				S875	S883		10.1093/infdis/jix396			10	DEC 15 2017	2017	For > 60 years, Zika virus (ZIKV) has been recognized as an arthropod-borne virus with Aedes species mosquitoes as the primary vector. However in the past 10 years, multiple alternative routes of ZIKV transmission have been identified. We review the available data on vector and non-vector-borne modes of transmission and interventions undertaken, to date, to reduce the risk of human infection through these routes. Although much has been learned during the outbreak in the Americas on the underlying mechanisms and pathogenesis of non-vector-borne ZIKV infections, significant gaps remain in our understanding of the relative incidence of, and risk from, these modes compared to mosquito transmission. Additional research is urgently needed on the risk, pathogenesis, and effectiveness of measures to mitigate non-vector-borne ZIKV transmission.																					WOS:000418238500004	29267909

The processing of HCV core protein by SPP has been reported to be critical for the propagation and pathogenesis of HCV. Here we examined the inhibitory activity of inhibitors for gamma-secretase, another intramembrane cleaving protease, against SPP, and our findings revealed that the dibenzoazepine-type structure in the gamma-secretase inhibitors is critical for the inhibition of SPP. The spatial distribution showed that the gamma-secretase inhibitor compound YO-01027 with the dibenzoazepine structure exhibits potent inhibiting activity against SPP in vitro and in vivo through the interaction of Val223 in SPP. Treatment with this SPP inhibitor suppressed the maturation of core proteins of all HCV genotypes without the emergence of drug-resistant viruses, in contrast to the treatment with direct-acting antivirals. YO-01027 also efficiently inhibited the propagation of protozoa such as Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii. These data suggest that SPP is an ideal target for the development of therapeutics not only against chronic hepatitis C but also against protozoiasis.

Rift Valley fever virus and European mosquitoes: vector competence of Culex pipiens and Stegomyia albopicta (=Aedes albopictus)								MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY				31	4			365	372		10.1111/mve.12254				DEC 2017	2017	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Rift Valley fever affects a large number of species, including human, and has severe impact on public health and the economy, especially in African countries. The present study examined the vector competence of three different European mosquito species, Culex pipiens (Linnaeus, 1758) form molestus (Diptera: Culicidae), Culex pipiens hybrid form and Stegomyia albopicta (=Aedes albopictus) (Skuse, 1894) (Diptera: Culicidae). Mosquitoes were artificially fed with blood containing RVFV. Infection, disseminated infection and transmission efficiency were evaluated. This is the first study to assess the transmission efficiency of European mosquito species using a virulent RVFV strain. The virus disseminated in Cx.pipiens hybrid form and in S.albopicta. Moreover, infectious viral particles were isolated from saliva of both species, showing their RVFV transmission capacity. The presence of competent Cx.pipiens and S.albopicta in Spain indicates that an autochthonous outbreak of RVF may occur if the virus is introduced. These findings provide information that will help health authorities to set up efficient entomological surveillance and RVFV vector control programmes.

Glycoprotein-G-gene-based molecular and phylogenetic analysis of rabies viruses associated with a large outbreak of bovine rabies in southern Brazil								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				162	12			3697	3704		10.1007/s00705-017-3533-8				DEC 2017	2017	A large outbreak of hematophagous-bat-associated bovine rabies has been occurring in Rio Grande do Sul (RS), the southernmost Brazilian state, since 2011, with official estimates exceeding 50,000 cattle deaths. The present article describes a genetic characterization of rabies virus (RABV) recovered from 59 affected cattle and two sheep, from 56 herds in 16 municipalities (2012-2016). Molecular analysis was performed using the nucleotide (nt) and predicted amino acid (aa) sequences of RABV glycoprotein G (G). A high level of nt and aa sequence identity was observed among the examined G sequences, ranging from 98.4 to 100%, and from 97.3 to 100%, respectively. Likewise, high levels of nt and aa sequence identity were observed with bovine (nt, 99.8%; aa, 99.8%) and hematophagous bat (nt, 99.5%; aa, 99.4%) RABV sequences from GenBank, and lower levels were observed with carnivore RABV sequences (nt, 92.8%; aa, 88.1%). Some random mutations were observed in the analyzed sequences, and a few consistent mutations were observed in some sequences belonging to cluster 2, subcluster 2b. The clustering of the sequences was observed in a phylogenetic tree, where two distinct clusters were evident. Cluster 1 comprised RABV sequences covering the entire study period (2012 to 2016), but subclusters corresponding to different years could be identified, indicating virus evolution and/or introduction of new viruses into the population. In some cases, viruses from the same location obtained within a short period grouped into different subclusters, suggesting co-circulation of viruses of different origins. Subcluster segregation was also observed in sequences obtained in the same region during different periods, indicating the involvement of different viruses in the cases at different times. In summary, our results indicate that the outbreaks occurring in RS (2012 to 2016) probably involved RABV of different origins, in addition to a possible evolution of RABV isolates within this period.

J	de Almeida Ponde, Roberio Amorim								The serological markers of acute infection with hepatitis A, B, C, D, E and G viruses revisited								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				162	12			3587	3602		10.1007/s00705-017-3538-3				DEC 2017	2017	Viral hepatitis is a liver infection caused by one of the six hepatitis viruses: hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, and G virus (HAV to HEV and HGV). These agents differ in their biological, immunological, pathological and epidemiological characteristics. They cause infections that, when symptomatic, lead to clinical manifestations and laboratory findings that are not specific to a particular virus, often making differential diagnosis difficult, especially when no knowledge is available regarding the patient's medical history or the epidemiological background. A number of acute-phase serological markers, such as anti-HAV, anti-HBc, anti-HDV and anti-HEV IgM antibodies, are able to provide a clear indication of an infection caused by HAV, HBV, HDV or HEV. Anti-HCV antibodies and HGV/RNA are used for the diagnosis of HCV and HGV infections. The importance of each of these markers will be reviewed, and different factors that can interfere with the diagnosis of acute infections caused by these viruses will be described.

Structural optimization studies were focused on the development of 5a analogues which retain the potency as YFV inhibitors and show a reduced cytotoxicity. The synthesized 1-3,5-triphenyl-pyrazolines (4a-j, 5a-j, 6a-j) were evaluated in cell based assays for cytotoxicity and antiviral activity against representative viruses of two of the three genera of the Flaviviridae family, i.e.: Pestivirus (BVDV) and Flavivirus (YFV). These compounds were also tested against a large panel of different pathogenic RNA and DNA viruses. Most of the new 1-3,5-triphenyl-pyrazolines (4a-j, 5a j, 6a-j) exhibited a specific activity against YFV, showing EC50 values in the low micromolar range with almost a 10-fold improvement in potency compared to the reference inhibitor 6-azauridine. However, the selectivity indexes of the unsubstituted (4a-j) and the phenoxy (5a-j) analogues were generally modest due to the pronounced cytotoxicity against BHK-21 cells. Otherwise, the benzyloxy derivatives (6a-j) generally coupled high potency and selectivity. On the basis of both anti-YFV activity and selectivity index, pyrazolines 6a and 6b were chosen for time of addition experiments. The selected pyrazolines and the reference inhibitor 6-azauridine displayed maximal inhibition when added in the pretreatment or during the infection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Respiratory syncytial virus infection influences tight junction integrity								CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY				190	3			351	359		10.1111/cei.13042				DEC 2017	2017	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important risk factor of asthma development and is responsible for severe respiratory tract infections. However, the influence of RSV infection on barrier function of bronchial epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo is still unclear. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of RSV in tight junction (TJ) regulation and to compare epithelial integrity between asthmatic and healthy individuals upon RSV infection. Healthy and asthmatic human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) were differentiated at air-liquid interface (ALI) and infected with RSV and ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated RSV. TJ expression and their integrity were analysed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), transepithelial resistance (TER) and paracellular flux. To determine the effect in vivo, BALB/c mice were infected intranasally with RSV or UV-irradiated RSV A2. Bronchoalveolar lavage and TJ integrity were analysed on days 1, 2, 4 and 6 post-infection by qPCR, bioplex and confocal microscopy. RSV increased barrier integrity in ALI cultures of HBEC from healthy subjects, but no effect was found in HBECs from asthmatics. This was not associated with an increase in TJ mRNA expression. In vivo, RSV induced lung inflammation in mice and down-regulated claudin-1 and occludin mRNA expression in whole lungs. Surprisingly, RSV infection was not observed in bronchial epithelial cells, but was found in the lung parenchyma. Decreased expression of occludin upon RSV infection was visible in mouse bronchial epithelial cells in confocal microscopy. However, there was no regulation of claudin-1 and claudin-7 at protein level.																					WOS:000414937000008	28856667

Cryptic etiopathological conditions of equine nervous system with special emphasis on viral diseases								VETERINARY WORLD				10	12			1427	1438		10.14202/vetworld.2017.1427-1438				DEC 2017	2017	The importance of horse (Equus caballus) to equine practitioners and researchers cannot be ignored. An unevenly distributed population of equids harbors numerous diseases, which can affect horses of any age and breed. Among these, the affections of nervous system are potent reason for death and euthanasia in equids. Many episodes associated with the emergence of equine encephalitic conditions have also pose a threat to human population as well, which signifies their pathogenic zoonotic potential. Intensification of most of the arboviruses is associated with sophisticated interaction between vectors and hosts, which supports their transmission. The alphaviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses are the major implicated groups of viruses involved with equines/humans epizootic/epidemic. In recent years, many outbreaks of deadly zoonotic diseases such as Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and Japanese encephalitis in many parts of the globe addresses their alarming significance. The equine encephalitic viruses differ in their global distribution, transmission and main vector species involved, as discussed in this article. The current review summarizes the status, pathogenesis, pathology, and impact of equine neuro-invasive conditions of viral origin. A greater understanding of these aspects might be able to provide development of advances in neuro-protective strategies in equine population.																					WOS:000418496000004	29391683

Risk Mitigation of Emerging Zoonoses: Hendra Virus and Non-Vaccinating Horse Owners								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				64	6			1898	1911		10.1111/tbed.12588				DEC 2017	2017	Hendra virus was identified in horses and humans in 1994, in Queensland, Australia. Flying foxes are the natural host. Horses are thought to acquire infection by direct or indirect contact with infected flying fox urine. Humans are infected from close contact with infected horses. To reduce risk of infection in horses and humans, Australian horse owners are encouraged to vaccinate horses against the virus and adopt property risk mitigation practices that focus on reducing flying fox horse contact and contamination of horses' environment with flying fox bodily fluids. This study investigates uptake of four Hendra virus risk mitigation practices in a sample of non- and partially vaccinating horse owners living close to previous Hendra virus cases. Protection motivation theory was used to develop a conceptual model to investigate risk perception and coping factors associated with uptake of risk mitigation practices. An online survey was administered via Facebook pages of veterinary clinics close to previous Hendra virus cases. Factors associated with uptake of risk mitigation practices were investigated using univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression. Belief that a risk mitigation practice would be effective in reducing Hendra virus risk was significantly associated with the uptake of that practice. Issues around the practicality of implementing risk mitigation practices were found to be the greatest barrier to uptake. Factors that relate to risk immediacy, such as nearby infection, were identified as more likely to trigger uptake of risk mitigation practices. The role of veterinarians in supporting Hendra risk mitigation was identified as more influential than that of respected others or friends. Findings from this study are being used to assist stakeholders in Australia responsible for promotion of risk mitigation practice in identifying additional pathways and reliable influencing factors that could be utilized for engaging and communicating with horse owners to promote Hendra virus risk mitigation behaviour.

Rift Valley fever virus infections in Egyptian cattle and their prevention								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				64	6			2049	2058		10.1111/tbed.12616				DEC 2017	2017	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes consistently severe outbreaks with high public health impacts and economic losses in livestock in many African countries and has also been introduced to Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Egypt with its four large outbreaks in the last 40years represents the northernmost endemic area of RVFV. The purpose of this study was to provide an insight into the current anti-RVFV antibody status in immunized as well as non-immunized dairy cattle from the Nile Delta of Egypt. During 2013-2015, a total of 4,167 dairy cattle from four governorates including Dakahlia, Damietta, Gharbia and Port Said were investigated. All cattle were born after 2007 and therewith after the last reported Egyptian RVFV outbreak in 2003. The samples derived from vaccinated animals from 26 different dairy farms as well as non-immunized cattle from 27 different smallholding flocks. All samples were examined following a three-part analysis including a commercially available competition ELISA, an in-house immunofluorescence assay and a virus neutralization test. Additionally, a subset of samples was analysed for acute infections using IgM ELISA and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. The results indicated that the RVFV is still circulating in Egypt as about 10% of the non-immunized animals exhibited RVFV-specific antibodies. Surprisingly, the antibody prevalence in immunized animals was not significantly higher than that in non-vaccinated animals which points out the need for further evaluation of the vaccination programme. Due to the substantial role of livestock in the amplification and transmission of RVFV, further recurrent monitoring of the antibody prevalence in susceptible species is highly warranted.

Consequences of congenital Zika virus infection								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				27				1	7		10.1016/j.coviro.2017.09.005				DEC 2017	2017	The 2015 Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas led to the discovery that ZIKV causes congenital abnormalities including microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, and eye disease that can result in blindness. Studies in animal models and human organoid cultures, together with human epidemiological studies, have shown that ZIKV crosses the placenta and subsequently replicates within fetal tissues including the developing brain. Preferential infection of neural cell precursors causes damage to the developing fetal brain. However, a majority of congenitally infected humans do not develop microcephaly or other overt congenital abnormalities, so longitudinal epidemiological studies are necessary to more completely define the long-term consequences of in utero ZIKV infection.

Vector competence of European mosquitoes for West Nile virus								EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS				6						e96	10.1038/emi.2017.82				NOV 8 2017	2017	West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod- borne flavivirus of high medical and veterinary importance. The main vectors for WNV are mosquito species of the Culex genus that transmit WNV among birds, and occasionally to humans and horses, which are 'deadend' hosts. Recently, several studies have been published that aimed to identify the mosquito species that serve as vectors for WNV in Europe. These studies provide insight in factors that can influence vector competence of European mosquito species for WNV. Here, we review the current knowledge on vector competence of European mosquitoes for WNV, and the molecular knowledge on physical barriers, anti-viral pathways and microbes that influence vector competence based on studies with other flaviviruses. By comparing the 12 available WNV vector competence studies with European mosquitoes we evaluate the effect of factors such as temperature, mosquito origin and mosquito biotype on vector competence. In addition, we propose a standardised methodology to allow for comparative studies across Europe. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps regarding vector competence that, once addressed, will provide important insights into WNV transmission and ultimately contribute to effective strategies to control WNV.

Vaccinations among the general public ceased shortly after the successful eradication campaign, resulting in an increasingly immunologically susceptible population. Because of the possibility of intentional reintroduction of Variola virus and the emergence of other pathogenic poxviruses, there is a great need for the development of medical countermeasures to treat poxvirus disease. It is highly likely that the U.S. FDA "animal rule" will be necessary for regulatory approval of these interventions. Therefore, relevant animal models and the associated supporting assays will require development to stand up to regulatory scrutiny.Methods: An optimized real time PCR assay for the detection of orthopoxviruses has been developed by researchers at the United States Army Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). To support animal studies that will be used to support approval of medical countermeasures by the U.S. FDA, the assay was designed to quantitate poxvirus genomic DNA in a nonhuman primate (cynomolgus macaque) blood matrix as a measurement of viremia. This manuscript describes the validation of the process, including DNA extraction from whole blood anticoagulated with EDTA, for obtaining and quantitating monkeypox genomes by evaluating precision, accuracy, the standard curve, specificity, robustness and stability of the assay and/or components of the assay.Results: The assay had a lower limit of quantitation of 50 genome copies/5 uL sample, upper limit of quantitation of 5 x 10(7) GC/5uL sample and a limit of detection of 2.5 genome copies /5uL sample. The assay was specific for orthopoxvirus. Matrix effects were detected and suggest the presence of PCR inhibitor(s) that was co-extracted with the target DNA.Conclusions: The assay has been validated for the purpose of quantitating monkeypox viral load in blood from cynomolgus macaques. This assay has and will continue to support submissions to the FDA for approval of antiviral therapeutics for smallpox.																					WOS:000414579500001	29100534

Zika virus: Current concerns in India								INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH				146				572	575		10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1160_17				NOV 2017	2017	With confirmation of Zika virus (ZIKV) presence in India, screening of a large number of febrile illness samples yielded only four positive cases. In this review, we address the current concern with context to India. The possible reasons for low level of Zika prevalence in India have been discussed, by extracting some probable explanations from previous experience of chikungunya virus-vector model/studies. In the current context, it is hypothesized that Indian mosquito strains have lower susceptibility gradient/threshold for ZIKV. The very low positivity in the humans also indicates low levels of mosquito-human-mosquito transmission cycle. There is also a need to look for the existence of any such animal cycle/sylvatic involvement in India. The recently detected four cases in India show local transmission of ZIKV suggesting that ZIKV might have been present in India since long time. The earlier vector-virus relationship studies with chikungunya suggested that in due course of time, ZIKV might become a major public health concern in the future.

West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are emerging neuropathogenic flaviviruses, both endemic in most part of the Italian territories. To monitor the circulation of PUUV, DOBV, WNV, and USUV in natural environment in central Italy, we carried out serological surveillance in wild rodents. During this study, 90 animals were captured in forested areas of Abruzzo and Marche regions and tested with serological assays for the specific pathogens. Serological test provided no evidence of PUUV and DOBV circulation in the studied area. However, four rodents (Apodemus flavicollis) were found to be positive by WNV ELISA test. Two of them were confirmed as WNV by virus neutralization test.																					WOS:000413641400007	28953448

RSV fusion (F) glycoprotein is a key target for neutralizing antibodies. RSV F stabilized in its pre-fusion conformation (DS-Cav1 F) induces high neutralizing antibody titers in naive animals, but it remains unknown to what extent pre-fusion F can boost pre-existing neutralizing responses in RSV seropositive adults. We here assess DS-Cav1 F immunogenicity in seropositive cattle pre-exposed to bovine RSV, a virus closely related to hRSV. A single immunization with non-adjuvanted DS-Cav1 F strongly boosts RSV neutralizing responses, directed towards pre-fusion F-specific epitopes, whereas a post-fusion F is unable to do so. Vaccination with pre-fusion F thus represents a promising strategy for maternal immunization and for other RSV vaccine target populations such as older adults.

SPgV had no effect on acute-phase SIV pathogenesis-as measured by SIV viral load, CD4+ T cell destruction, immune activation, or adaptive immune responses-suggesting that HPgV's protective effect is exerted primarily during the chronic phase of HIV infection. We also examined the immune response to SPgV in unprecedented detail, and found that this virus elicits virtually no activation of the immune system despite persistently high titers in the blood over long periods of time. Overall, this study expands our understanding of the pegiviruses-an understudied group of viruses with a high prevalence in the global human population-and suggests that the protective effect observed in HIV+ HPgV co-infected people occurs primarily during the chronic phase of HIV infection.

J	Earl, Patricia L.; Americo, Jeffrey L.; Moss, Bernard								Insufficient Innate Immunity Contributes to the Susceptibility of the Castaneous Mouse to Orthopoxvirus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				91	19					e01042-17	10.1128/JVI.01042-17				OCT 2017	2017	The castaneous (CAST) mouse, a wild-derived inbred strain, is highly susceptible to orthopoxvirus infection by intranasal and systemic routes. The 50% lethal intraperitoneal dose of vaccinia virus (VACV) was 3 PFU for CAST mice, whereas BALB/c mice survived 106 PFU. At all times and in all organs analyzed, virus titers were higher in CAST than in BALB/c mice. In individual CAST mice, luciferaseexpressing VACV was seen to replicate rapidly leading to death, whereas virus levels increased for a few days and then declined in BALB/c mice. Increases in gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were delayed and low in CAST mice compared to BALB/c mice following VACV infection or poly(I-C) inoculation, consistent with differences in innate immune responses. In addition, naive CAST mice had considerably lower numbers of NK and T cells than BALB/c mice. The percentage of IFN-gamma -producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells increased following infection of CAST mice only after considerable virus spread, and the absolute cell numbers remained low. Administration of exogenous IFN-gamma or -alpha to CAST mice before or during the first days of infection suppressed virus replication and prolonged survival, allowing the mice to make adaptive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses that were necessary to clear the virus after cessation of interferon treatment. Thus, insufficient innate cytokine and cellular immune responses contribute to the unique susceptibility of CAST mice to VACV, whereas the adaptive immune response can be protective only if virus replication is suppressed during the first several days of infection.IMPORTANCE Most inbred mouse strains are relatively resistant to orthopoxviruses. The castaneous (CAST) mouse is a notable exception, exhibiting extreme vulnerability to monkeypox virus, cowpox virus, and vaccinia virus and thus providing a unique model for studying pathogenicity, immunity, vaccines, and antiviral drugs. To fully utilize the CAST mouse for such purposes, it is necessary to understand the basis for virus susceptibility. We showed that naive CAST mice make low IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha responses and have low levels of NK cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells compared to a resistant classical inbred mouse strain. Attenuating virus replication with one or more doses of exogenous IFN-alpha or -gamma before or during the first few days of infection enabled the development of adaptive cellular immunity and clearance of virus. Further genetic studies may reveal the basis for the low innate immunity.																					WOS:000410261600031	28747505	
J	Welch, Jessica Nicole; Leppanen, Christy								The threat of invasive species to bats: a review								MAMMAL REVIEW				47	4			277	290		10.1111/mam.12099				OCT 2017	2017	1 Biological invasions are a major driver of biodiversity loss, but no study has described the scope of threats to bats (Chiroptera) by invasive species. We reviewed the literature for negative effects of invasive species to bats and summarised threats according to four categories: predation, disease, competition, and indirect interactions. We identified threats of 37 invasive species to 40 bat species. Ten bat species were threatened by more than one invasion pathway. About 38 percent of cases are speculative and 18 percent circumstantial, many attributed to overlapping ranges, and most accounts do not quantify effects needed to forecast bat population impacts. Evidence of cat predation is frequently cited, constituting the greatest incidence of observational data. Other direct and indirect impacts were documented from goats, dogs, brown tree snake, rainbow lorikeet, rose-ringed parakeet, yellow crazy ant, giant centipede, palm, burdock, avian cholera, and white-nose syndrome. Circumstantial evidence suggests impacts by rats, stoats, coqui frog, common wolf snake, little fire ant, kudzu, and Lantana camara. Other impacts by giant centipede, yellow crazy ant, cats, goats, rats, and avian cholera are speculative, as are those from pigs, deer, white eye, common starling, house sparrow, rock dove, barn and little owls, brush-tailed possum, honeybee, wasp, phytophagous insects, tamarisk, Cinnamomum verum, and Tabebuia pallida. Over 60 percent of bat species reviewed are island-dwelling, corresponding with evidence indicating that most extinctions occur on islands and invasive species' impacts are worse for island than mainland populations. Although appreciable bat population reductions owing to invasive species are often unproven, invasions are likely to exacerbate effects of other vulnerabilities. Multiple invaders and synergistic interactions may ultimately lead to species losses. Managers should exercise the precautionary principle by taking action against non-native species when first detected, even if new species do not appear to be detrimental.

The initial characterization of TCRV suggested that artibeus bats were natural reservoir hosts. However, nearly 60 years later experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) resulted in fatal disease or clearance, suggesting artibeus bats may not be a reservoir host. To further evaluate the TCRV reservoir host status of artibeus bats, we captured bats of six species in Trinidad for evidence of infection. Bats of all four fruigivorous species captured had antibodies to TCRV nucleocapsid, whereas none of the insectivore or nectarivore species did. Many flat-faced fruit-eating bats (A. planirostris) and great fruit-eating bats (A. literatus) were seropositive by ELISA and western blot to TCRV nucleocapsid antigen, as were two of four Seba's fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) and two of three yellow-shouldered fruit bats (Sturnira lilium). Serum neutralization tests failed to detect neutralizing antibodies to TCRV from these bats. TCRV RNA was not detected in lung tissues or lung homogenates inoculated onto Vero cells. These data indicate that TCRV or a similar arenavirus continues to circulate among fruit bats of Trinidad but there was no evidence of persistent infection, suggesting artibeus bats are not reservoir hosts.

High HPgV replication is associated with improved surrogate markers of HIV progression								PLOS ONE				12	9					e0184494	10.1371/journal.pone.0184494				SEP 14 2017	2017	BackgroundHuman Pegivirus (HPgV) may have a beneficial effect on HIV disease progression in co-infected patients; however, the virologic characteristics of this infection are not well defined. In this study, we determined HPgV viremia prevalence in Mexico and provide new insights to understand HPgV infection and HPgV/HIV co-infection.MethodsWe analyzed and quantified 7,890 serum samples for HPgV viremia by One-Step RT-Real-Time PCR, 6,484 from healthy blood donors and 1,406 from HIV-infected patients. Data on HIV progression were obtained from patients' records. HPgV genotyping was performed in 445 samples by nested PCR of the 5'URT region. Finite Mixture Models were used to identify clustering patterns of HPgV viremia in blood donors and co-infected antiretroviral (ART)naive patients.ResultsHPgV was detected in 2.98% of blood donors and 33% of HIV patients, with a wide range of viral loads. The most prevalent genotypes were 3 (58.6%) and 2 (33.7%). HPgV viral loads from healthy blood donors and HPgV/HIV+ ART-naive co-infected patients were clustered into two component distributions, low and high, with a cut-off point of 5.07log(10) and 5.06log(10), respectively. High HPgV viremia was associated with improved surrogate markers of HIV infection, independent of the estimated duration of HIV infection or HIV treatment.ConclusionsHPgV prevalence in Mexico was similar to that reported for other countries. The prevalent genotypes could be related to Mexico's geographic location and ethnicity, since genotype 2 is frequent in the United States and Europe and genotype 3 in Asia and Amerindian populations. HPgV viral load demonstrated two patterns of replication, low and high. The more pronounced beneficial response observed in co-infected patients with high HPgV viremia may explain discrepancies found between other studies. Mechanisms explaining high and low HPgV replication should be explored to determine whether the persistently elevated replication depends on host or viral factors.

J	Kammerer, Robert; Mansfeld, Martin; Haenske, Jana; Missbach, Sophie; He, Xiaocui; Kollner, Bernd; Mouchantat, Susan; Zimmermann, Wolfgang								Recent expansion and adaptive evolution of the carcinoembryonic antigen family in bats of the Yangochiroptera subgroup								BMC GENOMICS				18						717	10.1186/s12864-017-4106-7				SEP 11 2017	2017	Background: Expansions of gene families are predictive for ongoing genetic adaptation to environmental cues. We describe such an expansion of the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) gene family in certain bat families. Members of the CEA family in humans and mice are exploited as cellular receptors by a number of pathogens, possibly due to their function in immunity and reproduction. The CEA family is composed of CEA-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) and secreted pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSGs). PSGs are almost exclusively expressed by trophoblast cells at the maternal-fetal interface. The reason why PSGs exist only in a minority of mammals is still unknown.Results: Analysis of the CEA gene family in bats revealed that in certain bat families, belonging to the subgroup Yangochiroptera but not the Yinpterochiroptera subgroup an expansion of the CEA gene family took place, resulting in approximately one hundred CEA family genes in some species of the Vespertilionidae. The majority of these genes encode secreted PSG-like proteins (further referred to as PSG). Remarkably, we found strong evidence that the ligand-binding domain (IgV-like domain) of PSG is under diversifying positive selection indicating that bat PSGs may interact with structurally highly variable ligands. Such ligands might represent bacterial or viral pathogen adhesins. We have identified two distinct clusters of PSGs in three Myotis species. The two PSG cluster differ in the amino acids under positive selection. One cluster was only expanded in members of the Vespertilionidae while the other was found to be expanded in addition in members of the Miniopteridae and Mormoopidae. Thus one round of PSG expansion may have occurred in an ancestry of all three families and a second only in Vespertilionidae. Although maternal ligands of PSGs may exist selective challenges by two distinct pathogens seem to be likely responsible for the expansion of PSGs in Vespertilionidae.Conclusions: The rapid expansion of PSGs in certain bat species together with selection for diversification suggest that bat PSGs could be part of a pathogen defense system by serving as decoy receptors and/or regulators of feto-maternal interactions.

J	Schountz, Tony; Baker, Michelle L.; Butler, John; Munster, Vincent								Immunological Control of Viral Infections in Bats and the Emergence of Viruses Highly Pathogenic to Humans								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				8						1098	10.3389/fimmu.2017.01098				SEP 11 2017	2017	Bats are reservoir hosts of many important viruses that cause substantial disease in humans, including coronaviruses, filoviruses, lyssaviruses, and henipaviruses. Other than the lyssaviruses, they do not appear to cause disease in the reservoir bats, thus an explanation for the dichotomous outcomes of infections of humans and bat reservoirs remains to be determined. Bats appear to have a few unusual features that may account for these differences, including evidence of constitutive interferon (IFN) activation and greater combinatorial diversity in immunoglobulin genes that do not undergo substantial affinity maturation. We propose these features may, in part, account for why bats can host these viruses without disease and how they may contribute to the highly pathogenic nature of bat-borne viruses after spillover into humans. Because of the constitutive IFN activity, bat-borne viruses may be shed at low levels from bat cells. With large naive antibody repertoires, bats may control the limited virus replication without the need for rapid affinity maturation, and this may explain why bats typically have low antibody titers to viruses. However, because bat viruses have evolved in high IFN environments, they have enhanced countermeasures against the IFN response. Thus, upon infection of human cells, where the IFN response is not constitutive, the viruses overwhelm the IFN response, leading to abundant virus replication and pathology.

Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats.IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.

The History of Rabies in Trinidad: Epidemiology and Control Measures								TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE				2	3					27	10.3390/tropicalmed2030027				SEP 2017	2017	Vampire bat-transmitted rabies was first recognized in Trinidad during a major outbreak reported in 1925. Trinidad is the only Caribbean island with vampire bat-transmitted rabies. We conducted a literature review to describe the changing epidemiology of rabies in Trinidad and give a historical perspective to rabies prevention and control measures on the island. The last human case of rabies occurred in 1937 and although no case of canine-transmitted rabies was reported since 1914, sporadic outbreaks of bat-transmitted rabies still occur in livestock to date. Over the last century, seven notable epidemics were recorded in Trinidad with the loss of over 3000 animals. During the 1950s, several measures were effectively adopted for the prevention and control of the disease which led to a significant reduction in the number of cases. These measures include: vampire bat population control, livestock vaccination, and animal surveillance. However, due to lapses in these measures over the years (e.g., periods of limited vampire control and incomplete herd vaccination), epidemics have occurred. In light of the significant negative impact of rabies on animal production and human health, rabies surveillance in Trinidad should be enhanced and cases evaluated towards the design and implementation of more evidence-based prevention and control programs.

Lagos Bat Virus Infection Dynamics in Free-Ranging Straw-Colored Fruit Bats (Eidolon helvum)								TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE				2	3					25	10.3390/tropicalmed2030025				SEP 2017	2017	Bats are key species for ecological function, but they are also reservoirs of zoonotic agents, such as lyssaviruses that cause rabies. Little is known about the maintenance and transmission of lyssaviruses in bats, although the observation of clinically sick bats, both in experimental studies and wild bats, has at least demonstrated that lyssaviruses are capable of causing clinical disease in bat species. Despite this, extensive surveillance for diseased bats has not yielded lyssaviruses, whilst serological surveys demonstrate that bats must be exposed to lyssavirus without developing clinical disease. We hypothesize that there is endemic circulation of Lagos bat virus (LBV) in the straw-coloured fruit bat (Eidolon helvum) in Ghana, West Africa. To investigate this further, longitudinal blood sampling was undertaken quarterly between 2012 and 2014 on wild E. helvum at two sites in Ghana. Serum samples were collected and tested for LBV-neutralizing antibodies using a modified flourescent antibody virus neutralisation (FAVN) assay (n = 294) and brains from moribund or dead bats were tested for antigen and viral RNA (n = 55). Overall, 44.7% of the 304 bats sampled had LBV-neutralising antibodies. None of the brain samples from bats contained lyssavirus antigen or RNA. Together with the results of an earlier serological study, our findings demonstrate that LBV is endemic and circulates within E. helvum in Ghana even though the detection of viral infection in dead bats was unsuccessful. Confirmation that LBV infection is endemic in E. helvum in Ghana is an important finding and indicates that the potential public health threats from LBV warrant further investigation.

The E2 glycoprotein of HPgV-1 is the principle mediator in the virus-cell interaction and as such harbors most of HPgV-1's antigenic determinants. HPgV-1 persists in blood cell precursors which are increasingly used for cell therapy.Methods: We studied HPgV-1 prevalence in a large cohort of females donating fetal tissues for clinical use. PCR was used for screening and estimation of viral load in viremic plasma and fetal samples. Sequence analysis was performed for portions of the 5'-untranslated and E2 regions of HPgV-1 purified from donor plasmas. Sequencing was followed by phylogenetic analysis.Results: HPgV-1 was revealed in 13.7% of plasmas, 5.0% of fetal tissues, 5.4% of chorions, exceeding the prevalence of HCV in these types of samples. Transmission of HPgV-1 occurred in 25.8% of traceable mother-chorion-fetal tissues triads. For HPgV-1-positive donors, a high viral load in plasma appears to be a prerequisite for transmission. However, about one third of fetal samples acquired infection from non-viremic individuals. Sequencing of 5'-untranslated region placed most HPgV-1 samples to genotype 2a. At the same time, a portion of E2 sequence provided a much weaker support for this grouping apparently due to a higher variability. Polymorphisms were detected in important structural and antigenic motifs of E2.Conclusion: HPgV-1 is efficiently transmitted to fetus at early embryonic stages. A high variability in E2 may pose a risk of generation of pathogenic subtypes. Although HPgV-1 is considered benign and no longer tested mandatorily in blood banks, the virus may have adversary effects at target niches if delivered with infected graft upon cell transplantation. This argues for the necessity of HPgV-1 testing of cell samples aimed for clinical use.																					WOS:000409134600001	28859680

We investigated the immune basis for the extreme susceptibility of MBT/Pas mice that die with mild to acute hepatitis by day 3 post-infection compared to more resistant BALB/cByJ mice that survive up to a week longer. Lower levels of neutrophils observed in the bone marrow and blood of infected MBT/Pas mice are unlikely to be causative of increased RVFV susceptibility as constitutive neutropenia in specific mutant mice did not change survival outcome. However, whereas MBT/Pas mice mounted an earlier inflammatory response accompanied by higher amounts of interferon (IFN)-alpha in the serum compared to BALB/cByJ mice, they failed to prevent high viral antigen load. Several immunological alterations were uncovered in infected MBT/Pas mice compared to BALB/cByJ mice, including low levels of leukocytes that expressed type I IFN receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) in the blood, spleen and liver, delayed leukocyte activation and decreased percentage of IFN-gamma-producing leukocytes in the blood. These observations are consistent with the complex mode of inheritance of RVFV susceptibility in genetic studies.																					WOS:000406815600009	28769107

In this article, taskforce members and other experts review what has been learned about ZIKV-induced disease in humans, its modes of transmission and the cause and nature of associated congenital manifestations. After describing the make-up of the taskforce, we summarize the emergence of ZIKV in the Americas, Africa and Asia, its spread by mosquitoes, and current control measures. We then review the spectrum of primary ZIKV-induced disease in adults and children, sites of persistent infection and sexual transmission, then examine what has been learned about maternal-fetal transmission and the congenital Zika syndrome, including knowledge obtained from studies in laboratory animals. Subsequent sections focus on vaccine development, antiviral therapeutics and new diagnostic tests. After reviewing current understanding of the mechanisms of emergence of Zika virus, we consider the likely future of the pandemic. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Modelling West Nile virus transmission risk in Europe: effect of temperature and mosquito biotypes on the basic reproduction number								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				7						5022	10.1038/s41598-017-05185-4				JUL 10 2017	2017	West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which has caused repeated outbreaks in humans in southern and central Europe, but thus far not in northern Europe. The main mosquito vector for WNV, Culex pipiens, consists of two behaviourally distinct biotypes, pipiens and molestus, which can form hybrids. Differences between biotypes, such as vector competence and host preference, could be important in determining the risk of WNV outbreaks. Risks for WNV establishment can be modelled with basic reproduction number (R-0) models. However, existing R0 models have not differentiated between biotypes. The aim of this study was, therefore, to explore the role of temperature-dependent and biotype-specific effects on the risk of WNV establishment in Europe. We developed an R0 model with temperature-dependent and biotype-specific parameters, and calculated R0 values using the next-generation matrix for several scenarios relevant for Europe. In addition, elasticity analysis was done to investigate the contribution of each biotype to R0. Global warming and increased mosquito-to-host ratios can possibly result in more intense WNV circulation in birds and spill-over to humans in northern Europe. Different contributions of the Cx. pipiens biotypes to R0 shows the importance of including biotype-specific parameters in models for reliable WNV risk assessments.

The virus is a member of the genus Flavivirus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigenic complex under the Flaviviridae family. The WNV is continuously spreading across Tunisia especially in the coastal and Southern area of the country. The first human West Nile disease (WND) epidemic in Tunisia occurred in 1997, since then, the quantity and the extension of spillover effects increased constantly. However, the existing knowledge of factors triggering such events continues to be rather poor. The last epidemic WNV human meningitis and meningoencephalitis recorded in 2012, with 86 cases and 6 deaths, confirmed the failure of the current system in predicting new cases. This review, based on analysis of scientific papers published between 1970 and 2015, summarises the state of knowledge on WNV in Tunisia and highlights the existing knowledge and research gaps that need to be addressed.

John								Drivers for Rift Valley fever emergence in Mayotte: A Bayesian modelling approach								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				11	7					e0005767	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005767				JUL 2017	2017	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a major zoonotic and arboviral hemorrhagic fever. The conditions leading to RVF epidemics are still unclear, and the relative role of climatic and anthropogenic factors may vary between ecosystems. Here, we estimate the most likely scenario that led to RVF emergence on the island of Mayotte, following the 2006-2007 African epidemic. We developed the first mathematical model for RVF that accounts for climate, animal imports and livestock susceptibility, which is fitted to a 12-years dataset. RVF emergence was found to be triggered by the import of infectious animals, whilst transmissibility was approximated as a linear or exponential function of vegetation density. Model forecasts indicated a very low probability of virus endemicity in 2017, and therefore of re-emergence in a closed system (i.e. without import of infected animals). However, the very high proportion of naive animals reached in 2016 implies that the island remains vulnerable to the import of infectious animals. We recommend reinforcing surveillance in livestock, should RVF be reported is neighbouring territories. Our model should be tested elsewhere, with ecosystem-specific data.

It is not usually routinely screened in clinical laboratories, though its presence in patients infected with other viruses such as hepatitis C virus and HIV has been commonly reported. The virus can be detected in the blood of infected individuals using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) mainly. It is a technique that is commonly used for different RNA material detection and other screening such as gene expression and testing. The method includes several steps, that is, transcription of the RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcriptase, amplification of the cDNA by PCR using well defined primers that target a particular region of the gene, and detection of the PCR products by various means such as agarose gel electrophoresis or hybridization and immunoassay using, for example, automated detection systems. Several primers targeting different regions of the genome, that is, NS3, NS5, and 5' NTR, have been developed for the amplification of the specific region and the detection of the virus. Moreover, variants of the RT-PCR have been designed to maximize the identification potential. These include, for example, RTPCR- ELISA, RT digital-PCR, and SYBR green real-time multiplex RT-PCR. Another type of method used to screen the virus is the detection of the presence of antibodies E2 (anti-E2) produced against the viral glycoprotein E2 in individuals who have been infected with the virus and have recovered or are in the process of recovering. The anti-E2s are detected by radio-immunoprecipitation assay and ELISA. Use of both antibody and RNA detection methods is necessary for a better epidemiological investigation of the prevalence of GBV-C. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

J	Walsh, Michael G.; de Smalen, Allard Willem; Mor, Siobhan M.								Wetlands, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density delineate risk of Rift Valley fever outbreaks in the African continent and Arabian Peninsula								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				11	7					e0005756	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005756				JUL 2017	2017	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an emerging, vector-borne viral zoonosis that has significantly impacted public health, livestock health and production, and food security over the last three decades across large regions of the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula. The potential for expansion of RVF outbreaks within and beyond the range of previous occurrence is unknown. Despite many large national and international epidemics, the landscape epidemiology of RVF remains obscure, particularly with respect to the ecological roles of wildlife reservoirs and surface water features. The current investigation modeled RVF risk throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula as a function of a suite of biotic and abiotic landscape features using machine learning methods. Intermittent wetland, wild Bovidae species richness and sheep density were associated with increased landscape suitability to RVF outbreaks. These results suggest the role of wildlife hosts and distinct hydrogeographic landscapes in RVF virus circulation and subsequent outbreaks may be underestimated. These results await validation by studies employing a deeper, field-based interrogation of potential wildlife hosts within high risk taxa.																					WOS:000408057300058	28742814

Natural exposure of bats in Grenada to rabies virus								Infection Ecology & Epidemiology				7				1332935	Article No.: 1332935		10.1080/20008686.2017.1332935				JUN 19 2017	2017	Introduction: Grenada is a rabies endemic country, where terrestrial rabies is maintained in the small Indian mongoose (Herpestes auropunctatus). The role of bats in the epidemiology of rabies in Grenada is unknown. A 1974 report described one rabies virus positive Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis), and a high seroprevalence in this species. In the current study, the natural exposure to rabies virus in Grenadian bats was re-evaluated. It is postulated that bats serve as a natural rabies reservoir, probably circulating a bat-specific rabies virus variant.Material and methods: Bats were trapped in 2015 in all six parishes of Grenada using mistand hand nets. For the detection of rabies virus in brain tissue, the direct fluorescent antibody test (dFAT) and the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used. Serum neutralizing antibodies were determined using the fluorescent antibody virus neutralization test (FAVN).Results and discussion: Brain tissue and sera from 111 insectivorous and frugivorous bats belonging to four species were tested (52 Artibeus jamaicensis, two Artibeus lituratus, 33 Glossophaga longirostris, 24 Molossus molossus). Rabies virus antigen and genomic RNA were not detected in brain tissues. Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in the sera of eight A. jamaicensis in four of the six parishes. Bats in Grenada continue to show natural exposure to rabies virus. As rabies virus was not isolated in this study, serology alone is not sufficient to determine the strain of rabies virus circulating in A. jamaicensis bats in Grenada.Conclusion: Artibeus jamaicensis appears to play a role as a reservoir bat species, which is of public health concern in Grenada. Dispersion of bats to neighboring islands is possible and serological bat surveys should be initiated in these neighboring states, especially in those areas that are free of rabies in terrestrial mammals.

Among the Flaviviridae members, pestivirus and flavivirus possess a viral structural protein E-rns or a non-structural protein 1 (NS1) as secretory glycoproteins, respectively, while Hepacivirus including HCV has no secretory glycoprotein. In case of pestivirus replication, the C-terminal long amphipathic alpha-helices of E-rns are important for anchoring to viral membrane. Here we show that host-derived apolipoproteins play functional roles similar to those of virally encoded E-rns and NS1 in the formation of infectious particles. We examined whether E-rns and NS1 could compensate for the role of apolipoproteins in particle formation of HCV in apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and ApoE double-knockout Huh7 (BE-KO), and nonhepatic 293T cells. We found that exogenous expression of either E-rns or NS1 rescued infectious particle formation of HCV in the BE-KO and 293T cells. In addition, expression of apolipoproteins or NS1 partially rescued the production of infectious pestivirus particles in cells upon electroporation with an E-rns-deleted non-infectious RNA. As with exchangeable apolipoproteins, the C-terminal amphipathic alpha-helices of E-rns play the functional roles in the formation of infectious HCV or pestivirus particles. These results strongly suggest that the host-and virus-derived secretory glycoproteins have overlapping roles in the viral life cycle of Flaviviridae, especially in the maturation of infectious particles, while E-rns and NS1 also participate in replication complex formation and viral entry, respectively. Considering the abundant hepatic expression and liver-specific propagation of these apolipoproteins, HCV might have evolved to utilize them in the formation of infectious particles through deletion of a secretory viral glycoprotein gene.

J	Banerjee, Arinjay; Rapin, Noreen; Bollinger, Trent; Misra, Vikram								Lack of inflammatory gene expression in bats: a unique role for a transcription repressor								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				7						2232	10.1038/s41598-017-01513-w				MAY 22 2017	2017	In recent years viruses similar to those that appear to cause no overt disease in bats have spilled-over to humans and other species causing serious disease. Since pathology in such diseases is often attributed to an over-active inflammatory response, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells respond to stimulation of their receptors for viral ligands with a strong antiviral response, but unlike in human cells, the inflammatory response is not overtly activated. We compared the response of human and bat cells to poly(I:C), a viral double-stranded RNA surrogate. We measured transcripts for several inflammatory, interferon and interferon stimulated genes using quantitative real-time PCR and observed that human and bat cells both, when stimulated with poly(I:C), contained higher levels of transcripts for interferon beta than unstimulated cells. In contrast, only human cells expressed robust amount of RNA for TNF alpha, a cell signaling protein involved in systemic inflammation. We examined the bat TNF alpha promoter and found a potential repressor (c-Rel) binding motif. We demonstrated that c-Rel binds to the putative c-Rel motif in the promoter and knocking down c-Rel transcripts significantly increased basal levels of TNF alpha transcripts. Our results suggest bats may have a unique mechanism to suppress inflammatory pathology.																					WOS:000401754200019	28533548

M.; Johnson, Nicholas; Fooks, Anthony R.; Hewson, Roger								Rift Valley fever virus: strategies for maintenance, survival and vertical transmission in mosquitoes								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				98	5			875	887		10.1099/jgv.0.000765				MAY 2017	2017	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne arbovirus causing severe disease in humans and ruminants. Spread of RVFV out of Africa has raised concerns that it could emerge in Europe or the USA. Virus persistence is dependent on successful infection of, replication in, and transmission to susceptible vertebrate and invertebrate hosts, modulated by virus-host and vector-virus interactions. The principal accepted theory for the long-term maintenance of RVFV involves vertical transmission (VT) of virus to mosquito progeny, with the virus surviving long inter-epizootic periods within the egg. This VT hypothesis, however, is yet to be comprehensively proven. Here, evidence for and against the VT of RVFV is reviewed along with the identification of factors limiting its detection in natural and experimental data. The observations of VT for other arboviruses in the genera Alphavirus, Flavivirus and Orthobunyavirus are discussed within the context of RVFV. The review concludes that VT of RVFV is likely but that current data are insufficient to irrefutably prove this hypothesis.																					WOS:000403762900001	28555542	
J	Lythgoe, Katrina A.; Gardner, Andy; Pybus, Oliver G.; Grove, Joe								Short-Sighted Virus Evolution and a Germline Hypothesis for Chronic Viral Infections								TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY				25	5			336	348		10.1016/j.tim.2017.03.003				MAY 2017	2017	With extremely short generation times and high mutability, many viruses can rapidly evolve and adapt to changing environments. This ability is generally beneficial to viruses as it allows them to evade host immune responses, evolve new behaviours, and exploit ecological niches. However, natural selection typically generates adaptation in response to the immediate selection pressures that a virus experiences in its current host. Consequently, we argue that some viruses, particularly those characterised by long durations of infection and ongoing replication, may be susceptible to short-sighted evolution, whereby a virus' adaptation to its current host will be detrimental to its onward transmission within the host population. Here we outline the concept of short-sighted viral evolution and provide examples of how it may negatively impact viral transmission among hosts. We also propose that viruses that are vulnerable to short-sighted evolution may exhibit strategies that minimise its effects. We speculate on the various mechanisms by which this may be achieved, including viral life history strategies that result in low rates of within-host evolution, or the establishment of a 'germline' lineage of viruses that avoids short-sighted evolution. These concepts provide a new perspective on the way in which some viruses have been able to establish and maintain global pandemics.																					WOS:000399286000005	28377208

"We've learned to live with it"-A qualitative study of Australian horse owners' attitudes, perceptions and practices in response to Hendra virus								PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE				140				67	77		10.1016/j.prevetmed.2017.03.003				MAY 1 2017	2017	Hendra virus causes sporadic zoonotic disease in Australia following spill over from flying foxes to horses and from horses to people. Prevention and risk mitigation strategies such as vaccination of horses or bio-security and property management measures are widely publicised, but hinge on initiative and action taken by horse owners as they mediate management, care and treatment of their animals. Hence, underlying beliefs, values and attitudes of horse owners influence their uptake of recommended risk mitigation measures. We used a qualitative approach to investigate attitudes, perceptions and self-reported practices of horse owners in response to Hendra virus to gain a deeper understanding of their decision-making around prevention measures. Data presented here derive from a series of in-depth interviews with 27 horse owners from Hendra virus 'hot spot' areas in New South Wales and Queensland. Interviews explored previous experience, perceptions and resulting behaviour as well as communication around Hendra virus. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed in NVivo using thematic analysis. Analysis revealed four major themes: perception of Hendra virus as a risk and factors influencing this perception, Hendra virus risk mitigation strategies implemented by horse owners, perceived motivators and barriers of these strategies, and interaction of perceived risk, motivators and barriers in the decision making process. Although Hendra virus disease was perceived as a serious threat to the health of horses and humans, individual risk perception diverged among horse owners. Perceived severity, likelihood and unpredictability as well as awareness and knowledge of Hendra virus, trust in information obtained and information pathways, demographic characteristics and personal experience were the main factors influencing Hendra virus risk perceptions. Other key determinants of horse owners' decision-making process were attitudes towards Hendra virus risk mitigation measures as well as perceived motivators and barriers thereof. Horse owners' awareness of the necessity to consider individual Hendra virus risk and adequate risk management strategies was described as a learning process, which changed over time. However, different perceptions of risk, barriers and motivators in combination with a weighing up of advantages and disadvantages resulted in different behaviours. These findings demonstrate the multi factorial determinants of cognitive mediating processes and facilitate a better understanding of horse owners' perspectives on preventive horse health measures. Furthermore, they provide valuable feedback to industry and government stakeholders on how to improve effective risk communication and encourage uptake of recommended risk mitigation measures.

Loss in lung volume and changes in the immune response demonstrate disease progression in African green monkeys infected by small-particle aerosol and intratracheal exposure to Nipah virus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				11	4					e0005532	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005532				APR 2017	2017	Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus (genus Henipavirus) that emerged in the late 1990s in Malaysia and has since been identified as the cause of sporadic outbreaks of severe febrile disease in Bangladesh and India. NiV infection is frequently associated with severe respiratory or neurological disease in infected humans with transmission to humans through inhalation, contact or consumption of NiV contaminated foods. In the work presented here, the development of disease was investigated in the African Green Monkey (AGM) model following intratracheal (IT) and, for the first time, small-particle aerosol administration of NiV. This study utilized computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to temporally assess disease progression. The host immune response and changes in immune cell populations over the course of disease were also evaluated. This study found that IT and small-particle administration of NiV caused similar disease progression, but that IT inoculation induced significant congestion in the lungs while disease following small-particle aerosol inoculation was largely confined to the lower respiratory tract. Quantitative assessment of changes in lung volume found up to a 45% loss in IT inoculated animals. None of the subjects in this study developed overt neurological disease, a finding that was supported by MRI analysis. The development of neutralizing antibodies was not apparent over the 8-10 day course of disease, but changes in cytokine response in all animals and activated CD8+ T cell numbers suggest the onset of cell-mediated immunity. These studies demonstrate that IT and small-particle aerosol infection with NiV in the AGM model leads to a severe respiratory disease devoid of neurological indications. This work also suggests that extending the disease course or minimizing the impact of the respiratory component is critical to developing a model that has a neurological component and more accurately reflects the human condition.

Since canine hapacivirus, NPHV identified in dogs, was first discovered in dogs in the United States, equine hepacivirus (EqHV, NPHV identified in horses) has been identified in horses in several countries. However, no epidemiological studies have investigated EqHV in horses in Korea. In this study, a total of 74 (n = 74) serum samples collected from horses in four regions of Korea were tested for EqHV RNA using nested RT-PCR. Overall, 14 samples were identified as positive (18.9%) and further analyzed according to gender, age, breed, and region. There were high positive rates in males, young horses, and Thoroughbreds; however, these rates differed regionally. Sequencing of the partial NS3 region of 12 samples and the polyprotein encoding regions of two samples positive for EqHV RNA revealed that the Korean EqHV isolates shared approximately 85.3-99.6% and 97.7-100% homology at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the partial NS3 genes clustered with sequences previously reported as NPHV. Notably, sequences of EqHV detected in horses in the same region showed sequence divergence. The sequences of the polyprotein encoding region of two representative EqHVs shared 83.9% and 95.7% homology with each other at the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level, respectively. Comparison of the sequences of polyprotein encoding regions of Korean EqHV isolates and hepaciviruses from different hosts revealed that the NS3 and NS5B regions were most conserved among hepaciviruses. The results of the present study demonstrate that there is a high positive rate of EqHV in Korea and provide significant information regarding the geographical distribution and genetic variability of Korean EqHV isolates that will help improve global epidemiology of EqHV.

The natural reservoir of MARV is the Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus); that of EBOV is unknown but believed to be another bat species. The Egyptian rousette develops subclinical productive infection with MARV but is refractory to EBOV. Interaction of filoviruses with hosts is greatly affected by the viral interferon (IFN)-inhibiting domains (IID). Our study was aimed at characterization of innate immune responses to filoviruses and the role of filovirus IID in bat and human cells. The study demonstrated that EBOV and MARV replicate to similar levels in all tested cell lines, indicating that permissiveness for EBOV at cell and organism levels do not necessarily correlate. Filoviruses, particularly MARV, induced a potent innate immune response in rousette cells, which was generally stronger than that in human cells. Both EBOV VP35 and VP24 IID were found to suppress the innate immune response in rousette cells, but only VP35 IID appeared to promote virus replication. Along with IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, IFN-gamma was demonstrated to control filovirus infection in bat cells but not in human cells, suggesting host species specificity of the antiviral effect. The antiviral effects of bat IFNs appeared not to correlate with induction of IFN-stimulated genes 54 and 56, which were detected in human cells ectopically expressing bat IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. As bat IFN-gamma induced the type I IFN pathway, its antiviral effect is likely to be partially induced via cross talk.IMPORTANCE Bats serve as reservoirs for multiple emerging viruses, including filoviruses, henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, and zoonotic coronaviruses. Although there is no evidence for symptomatic disease caused by either Marburg or Ebola viruses in bats, spillover of these viruses into human populations causes deadly outbreaks. The reason for the lack of symptomatic disease in bats infected with filoviruses remains unknown. The outcome of a virus-host interaction depends on the ability of the host immune system to suppress viral replication and the ability of a virus to counteract the host defenses. Our study is a comparative analysis of the host innate immune response to either MARV or EBOV infection in bat and human cells and the role of viral interferon-inhibiting domains in the host innate immune responses. The data are useful for understanding the interactions of filoviruses with natural and accidental hosts and for identification of factors that influence filovirus evolution.

Most of this research has focused on old lineage (L) 1 strains, while information about pathogenicity is lacking for the most recent L1 and L2 strains, as well as for newly defined lineages. In this study, 4-week-old Swiss mice were inoculated with a collection of 12 WNV isolates, comprising 10 old and recent L1 and L2 strains, the putative L6 strain from Malaysia and the proposed L7 strain Koutango (KOU). The intraperitoneal inoculation of 10-fold dilutions of each strain allowed the characterization of the isolates in terms of LD50, median survival times, ID50, replication in neural and extraneural tissues and antibody production. Based on these results, we classified the isolates in three groups: high virulence (all L1a strains, recent L2 strains and KOU), moderate virulence (B956 strain) and low virulence (Kunjin and Malaysian isolates). We determined that the inoculation of a single dose of 1000 p.f.u. would be sufficient to classify WNV strains by pathotype. We confirmed the enhanced virulence of the KOU strain with a high capacity to cause rapid systemic infection. We also corroborated that differences in pathogenicity among strains do not correlate with phylogenetic lineage or geographic origin, and confirmed that recent European and African WNV strains belonging to L1 and L2 are highly virulent and do not differ in their pathotype profile compared to the prototype NY99 strain.

Within host RNA virus persistence: mechanisms and consequences								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				23				35	42		10.1016/j.coviro.2017.03.001				APR 2017	2017	In a prototypical response to an acute viral infection it would be expected that the adaptive immune response would eliminate all virally infected cells within a few weeks of infection. However many (non-retrovirus) RNA viruses can establish 'within host' persistent infections that occasionally lead to chronic or reactivated disease. Despite the importance of 'within host' persistent RNA virus infections, much has still to be learnt about the molecular mechanisms by which RNA viruses establish persistent infections, why innate and adaptive immune responses fail to rapidly clear these infections, and the epidemiological and potential disease consequences of such infections.

Epidemiological Profile of Wild Rabies in Brazil (2002-2012)								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				64	2			624	633		10.1111/tbed.12428				APR 2017	2017	Rabies is one of the most important zoonosis in the world with high impact on public health. Studies report the presence of Lyssavirus in reservoirs of the wild cycle, highlighting the role of wild canines, marmosets, and vampire and non-vampire bats as potential vectors of the disease to domestic animals and human beings. Therefore, the reintroduction of rabies in urban environments from reservoirs of the wild cycle is a matter of concern. This study describes the profile of rabies cases documented in Brazil from 2002 to 2012, with emphasis on the wild transmission cycle of the disease. We carried out a descriptive study using records with information on the time of infection, persons with infection and location of confirmed cases of rabies in humans and animals, as well as data on anti-rabies treatments obtained from the Information System of Notifiable Diseases (Sinan) database. Within the study period, 82 cases of rabies transmitted by wild animals to humans were reported, predominantly in rural areas of the northern and north-eastern regions. Of the cases in humans, 72% did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis. Among wild mammals, vampire bats were the most frequent vectors of the disease. In the north-east region, 460 terrestrial wild mammals were reported with confirmed rabies. Over the study period, 1703 bats were reported to carry the rabies virus. In the south-east region, the most frequently reported carriers of the virus were non-vampire bats. The midwest and northern regions presented a lower number of records of rabies cases among terrestrial wild mammals. However, the high number of rabies cases among bovines reflects the role of the vampire bat as a maintainer of the rabies virus in the rural cycle.

Global research trends of World Health Organization's top eight emerging pathogens								GLOBALIZATION AND HEALTH				13						9	10.1186/s12992-017-0233-9				FEB 8 2017	2017	Background: On December 8th, 2015, World Health Organization published a priority list of eight pathogens expected to cause severe outbreaks in the near future. To better understand global research trends and characteristics of publications on these emerging pathogens, we carried out this bibliometric study hoping to contribute to global awareness and preparedness toward this topic.Method: Scopus database was searched for the following pathogens/ infectious diseases: Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Rift valley, Crimean-Congo, Nipah, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Severe Respiratory Acute Syndrome (SARS). Retrieved articles were analyzed to obtain standard bibliometric indicators.Results: A total of 8619 journal articles were retrieved. Authors from 154 different countries contributed to publishing these articles. Two peaks of publications, an early one for SARS and a late one for Ebola, were observed. Retrieved articles received a total of 221,606 citations with a mean +/- standard deviation of 25.7 +/- 65.4 citations per article and an h-index of 173. International collaboration was as high as 86.9%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had the highest share (344; 5.0%) followed by the University of Hong Kong with 305 (4.5%). The top leading journal was Journal of Virology with 572 (6.6%) articles while Feldmann, Heinz R. was the most productive researcher with 197 (2.3%) articles. China ranked first on SARS, Turkey ranked first on Crimean-Congo fever, while the United States of America ranked first on the remaining six diseases. Of retrieved articles, 472 (5.5%) were on vaccine -related research with Ebola vaccine being most studied.Conclusion: Number of publications on studied pathogens showed sudden dramatic rise in the past two decades representing severe global outbreaks. Contribution of a large number of different countries and the relatively high h-index are indicative of how international collaboration can create common health agenda among distant different countries.

Characterization of non-lethal West Nile Virus (WNV) infection in horses: Subclinical pathology and innate immune response								MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS				103				71	79		10.1016/j.micpath.2016.12.018				FEB 2017	2017	Most natural West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans and horses are subclinical or sub-lethal and non-encephalitic. Yet, the main focus of WNV research remains on the pathogenesis of encephalitic disease, mainly conducted in mouse models. We characterized host responses during subclinical WNV infection in horses and compared outcomes with those obtained in a novel rabbit model of subclinical WNV infection (Suen et al. 2015. Pathogens, 4: 529). Experimental infection of 10 horses with the newly emerging WNV-strain, WNVNSW2011, did not result in neurological disease in any animal but transcriptional upregulation of both type I and II interferon (IFN) was seen in peripheral blood leukocytes prior to or at the time of viremia. Likewise, transcript upregulation for IFNs, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, CXCL10, TLRs, and MyD88 was detected in lymphoid tissues, while IFN alpha, CXCL10, TLR3, ISG15 and IRF7 mRNA was upregulated in brains with. histopathological evidence of mild encephalitis, but absence of detectable viral RNA or antigen. These responses were reproduced in the New Zealand White rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) experimentally infected with WNVNSW2011, by intradermal footpad inoculation. Kinetics of the anti-WNV antibody response was similar in horses and rabbits, which for both species may be explained by the early IFN and cytokine responses evident in circulating leukocytes and lymphoid organs. Given the similarities to the majority of equine infection outcomes, immunocompetent rabbits appear to represent a valuable small-animal model for investigating aspects of non-lethal WNV infections, notably mechanisms involved in abrogating morbidity.

These include severe clinical symptoms, multiple animal hosts, and widespread vector species living in close proximity to human habitats, all of which constitute significant risk factors for more frequent outbreaks in the future, greatly increasing the potential of these hidden enemies to follow Zika and become the next wave of global arboviral threats. Critically, the current dearth of knowledge on these arboviruses might impede the success of future control efforts, including the potential application of Wolbachia pipientis. This bacterium inherently possesses broad anti-pathogen properties and a means of genetic drive that allows it to eliminate or replace target vector populations. We conclude that control of obscure arboviruses with Wolbachia might be possible, but successful implementation will be critically dependent on the ability to transinfect key vector species.

J	Dubrau, Danilo; Tortorici, M. Alejandra; Rey, Felix A.; Tautz, Norbert								A positive-strand RNA virus uses alternative protein-protein interactions within a viral protease/cofactor complex to switch between RNA replication and virion morphogenesis								PLOS PATHOGENS				13	2					e1006134	10.1371/journal.ppat.1006134				FEB 2017	2017	The viruses of the family Flaviviridae possess a positive-strand RNA genome and express a single polyprotein which is processed into functional proteins. Initially, the nonstructural (NS) proteins, which are not part of the virions, form complexes capable of genome replication. Later on, the NS proteins also play a critical role in virion formation. The molecular basis to understand how the same proteins form different complexes required in both processes is so far unknown. For pestiviruses, uncleaved NS2-3 is essential for virion morphogenesis while NS3 is required for RNA replication but is not functional in viral assembly. Recently, we identified two gain of function mutations, located in the C-terminal region of NS2 and in the serine protease domain of NS3 (NS3 residue 132), which allow NS2 and NS3 to substitute for uncleaved NS2-3 in particle assembly. We report here the crystal structure of pestivirus NS3-4A showing that the NS3 residue 132 maps to a surface patch interacting with the C-terminal region of NS4A (NS4A-kink region) suggesting a critical role of this contact in virion morphogenesis. We show that destabilization of this interaction, either by alanine exchanges at this NS3/4A-kink interface, led to a gain of function of the NS3/4A complex in particle formation. In contrast, RNA replication and thus replicase assembly requires a stable association between NS3 and the NS4A-kink region. Thus, we propose that two variants of NS3/4A complexes exist in pestivirus infected cells each representing a basic building block required for either RNA replication or virion morphogenesis. This could be further corroborated by trans-complementation studies with a replication-defective NS3/ 4A double mutant that was still functional in viral assembly. Our observations illustrate the presence of alternative overlapping surfaces providing different contacts between the same proteins, allowing the switch from RNA replication to virion formation.

J	Houldsworth, Annwyne								Exploring the possibility of arthropod transmission of HCV								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY				89	2			187	194		10.1002/jmv.24638				FEB 2017	2017	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer occurring in up to 3% of the world's population. Parenteral exposure to HCV is the major mode of transmission of infection. Once established, infection will persist in up to 85% of individuals with only a minority of patients clearing viremia. Egypt has possibly the highest HCV prevalence in the world where 10-20% of the general population are infected with HCV. Endemic HCV appears to be concentrated in the tropics and sub-tropics where there are higher biting rates from insects. The question as to whether a bridge vector transmission is possible, via arthropods, both between humans and/or from an animal reservoir to humans is explored. Mechanical transmission, as opposed to biological transmission, is considered. Mechanical transmission can be an efficient way of transmitting an infection, as effective as biological transmission. Probability of transmission can increase as to the immediate circumstances and conditions at the time. Several factors may enhance mechanical transmission, including high levels of microbes in the vector, frequent biting, the close proximity, and contact between vectors and recipients as well as high density of insects. HCV has been isolated from bodies or heads of mosquitoes collected from the houses of HCV-infected individuals. The possibility of enzootic cycles of HCV tangential transmission via bridging vectors, such as, arthropods needs to be further investigated and possible animal reservoirs, including domestic rural epizootic cycles for HCV infection, requires further research with particular initial emphasis on equine infections.

Arboviruses can cause a variety of clinical presentations that range from mild to life threatening symptoms. Many arboviruses are present in nature through two distinct cycles, the urban and sylvatic cycle that are maintained in complex biological cycles. In this review we briefly discuss the factors driving the emergence of arboviruses, such as the anthropogenic aspects of unrestrained human population growth, economic expansion and globalization. Also the important aspects of viruses and vectors in the occurrence of arboviruses epidemics. The focus of this review will be on dengue, zika and chikungunya viruses, particularly because these viruses are currently causing a negative impact on public health and economic damage around the world.

The primary cycle involves mosquitoes and wild and domestic ruminant hosts. Humans are usually contaminated after contact with infected ruminants. As many environmental, agricultural, epidemiological, and anthropogenic factors are implicated in RVF spread, the multidisciplinary One Health approach was needed to identify the drivers of RVF epidemics in Madagascar. We examined the environmental patterns associated with these epidemics, comparing human and ruminant serological data with environmental and cattle-trade data. In contrast to East Africa, environmental drivers did not trigger the epidemics: They only modulated local Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission in ruminants. Instead, RVFV was introduced through ruminant trade and subsequent movement of cattle between trade hubs caused its long-distance spread within the country. Contact with cattle brought in from infected districts was associated with higher infection risk in slaughterhouse workers. The finding that anthropogenic rather than environmental factors are the main drivers of RVF infection in humans can be used to design better prevention and early detection in the case of RVF resurgence in the region.

Following the occurrence of two major outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Madagascar in 1990-91 and 2008-09, recent studies suggest that the pattern of RVF virus (RVFV) transmission differed among the four main eco-regions (East, Highlands, North-West and South-West). Using Bayesian hierarchical models fitted to serological data from cattle of known age collected during two surveys (2008 and 2014), we estimated RVF FOI and described its variations over time and space in Madagascar. We show that the patterns of RVFV transmission strongly differed among the eco-regions. In the North-West and Highlands regions, these patterns were synchronous with a high intensity in mid-2007/mid-2008. In the East and South-West, the peaks of transmission were later, between mid-2008 and mid-2010. In the warm and humid northwestern eco-region favorable to mosquito populations, RVFV is probably transmitted all year-long at low-level during inter-epizootic period allowing its maintenance and being regularly introduced in the Highlands through ruminant trade. The RVF surveillance of animals of the northwestern region could be used as an early warning indicator of an increased risk of RVF outbreak in Madagascar.

Susceptibility and Antibody Response of the Laboratory Model Zebra Finch (Taeniopygia guttata) to West Nile Virus								PLOS ONE				12	1					e0167876	10.1371/journal.pone.0167876				JAN 3 2017	2017	Since the introduction of West Nile virus (WNV) into North America in 1999 a number of passerine bird species have been found to play a role in the amplification of the virus. Arbovirus surveillance, observational studies and experimental studies have implicated passerine birds (songbirds, e.g., crows, American robins, house sparrows, and house finches) as significant reservoirs of WNV in North America, yet we lack a tractable passerine animal model for controlled studies of the virus. The zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) serves as a model system across a diversity of fields, and here we develop the zebra finch a songbird model for WNV. Like many natural hosts of WNV, we found that zebra finches developed sufficient viremia to serve as a competent host, yet in general resisted mortality from infection. In the Australian zebra finch (AZF) T. g. castanotis, we detected WNV in the majority of sampled tissues by 4 days post injection (dpi). However, WNV was not detected in tissues of sacrificed birds at 14 dpi, shortly after the development of detectable anti-WNV antibodies in the majority of birds indicating successful viral clearance. We compared susceptibility between the two zebra finch subspecies AZF and Timor zebra finch (TZF) T. g. guttata. Compared to AZF, WNV RNA was detected in a larger proportion of challenged TZF and molecular detection of virus in the serum of TZF was significantly higher than in AZF. Given the observed moderate host competence and disease susceptibility, we suggest that zebra finches are appropriate as models for the study of WNV and although underutilized in this respect, may be ideal models for the study of the many diseases carried and transmitted by songbirds.

To explore the relationship between the HPV vaccination status of a child and their mother's beliefs, behaviors and knowledge, we surveyed 1497 women with at least one child aged 9-17 y between September 2011 and November 2015. Physician recommendation was the most important factor associated with reported child vaccination status. Mothers who reported receiving a provider recommendation for the HPV vaccine were 32 times more likely to have a child who had been vaccinated compared with mothers who did not report provider recommendation (aOR) = 32.17; 95% CI: 21.77, 47.54). Knowing someone who had received the vaccine was also strongly associated with vaccination uptake (59% vs 12%, p < .001). Additionally, prior HPV diagnosis (aOR = 1.91; 95% CI: 1.18, 3.10) and knowing someone with cervical cancer (aOR = 1.38; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.89) were associated with child vaccination status. Mothers who perceived moderate to high risk for their child contracting HPV or developing genital warts or cervical cancer were more likely to report that their daughters (but not their sons) had been vaccinated.

Here we discuss drivers, strategies and practical considerations for developing vaccines against outbreak pathogens. Chimpanzee adenoviral (ChAd) vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates for multiple infectious diseases and prostate cancer. ChAd vectors are safe and induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immunity in all age groups, as well as circumventing the problem of pre-existing immunity encountered with human Ad vectors. For these reasons, such viral vectors provide an attractive platform for stockpiling vaccines for emergency deployment in response to a threatened outbreak of an emerging pathogen. Work is already underway to develop vaccines against a number of other outbreak pathogens and we will also review progress on these approaches here, particularly for Lassa fever, Nipah and MERS.					10th Annual Congress of the International-Society-for-Vaccines (ISV)10th Annual Congress of the International-Society-for-Vaccines (ISV)	OCT 02-04, 2016OCT 02-04, 2016	Int Soc VaccinesInt Soc Vaccines	Boston, MABoston, MA													WOS:000418052100040	29083948	
J	Krzowska-Firych, Joanna; Tomasiewicz, Krzysztof; Kozoowska, Agata								Post-exposure rabies prophylaxis in humans exposed to animals in Lublin province (Eastern Poland) in 2012-2015-A retrospective study								HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS				13	6			1346	1351		10.1080/21645515.2017.1285474				2017	2017	Rabies continues to be one of the most important viral diseases and remains a significant threat to public health across the globe. The post-exposure prophylaxis in humans can effectively prevent death after exposure to a potentially infected animal. In Poland, recommendations for rabies PEP followed the national guidelines which recommend that people should receive PEP when bitten by an animal suspected to be infected by rabies. PEP in humans includes cleansing and disinfecting the wound or point of contact, and administering anti-rabies immunization. Rabies vaccine should be given for contacts of category II and category III exposures. RIG should be given for category III contact. The vaccination schedule includes 5 doses given within a 30day period (the Essen regimen).The aim. The aim of our study was to determine the frequency of post-exposure prophylaxis among patients exposed to animals and also to assess the animal species suspected as a source of rabies exposure.Methods. We have retrospectively analyzed medical records from the years 2012-2015 of all adult patients who were exposed to animals and consulted at the Dispensary of Rabies Prophylaxis in the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Medical University in Lublin, Poland. All consulted patients were asked to give an informed consent in case of decision to use collected data for future research work.Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Medical University of Lublin, Poland, and all patients included in this study gave an informed consent during consultation after the exposure to animals.Results. During the studied 4-year period, 511 persons exposed to animals were consulted and prophylactic procedure consisting of active immunization were applied in 54.2% of the total consulted. Dogs and cats were the most common animal species suspected as the source of the rabies exposure. Anti-rabies prophylaxis was applied in 45.8% of all vaccinated patients exposed to dogs, and in 24.2% exposed to cats. All patients with bite wounds were consulted at the Department of Surgery and wound care followed surgical recommendations. In the study group, 45 patients had category III contact. There were 38 patients exposed to dogs, and 7 exposed to cats. There were no people exposed to wildlife in this group. All animals were available for veterinary observation. During and after exposure, none of the animals that serve as a potential source of infection presented with symptoms of rabies. The local epidemiological data indicated that during exposures of our patients, there were no confirmed cases of rabies among animals in Lublin province. Based on the data mentioned above, RIG was not applied.During the studied period in Lublin province, rabies was confirmed mainly in wildlife, and only in 2 dogs.Conclusions. In Lublin province, people are still at risk of exposure to rabid animals. The majority of our patients were vaccinated after domestic animals exposure, but rabies was confirmed mainly in wildlife, and since 2013, there were no cases of rabies among domestic animals.

YFV phylogenies indicate that the isolates collected from West Africa, East and Central Africa, and South America cluster into different lineages and the virus spread into the Americas from Africa. To determine the nature of genetic variation accompanying the intercontinental epidemic, we performed a genome-wide evolutionary study on the West African and South American lineages of YFV. Our results reveal that adaptive genetic diversification has occurred on viral nonstructural protein 5 (NS5), which is crucially required for viral genome replication, in the early epidemic phase of these currently circulating lineages. Furthermore, major amino acid changes relevant to the adaptive diversification generally cluster in different structural regions of NS5 in a lineage-specific manner. These results suggest that YFV has experienced adaptive diversification in the epidemic spread between the continents and shed insights into the genetic determinants of such diversification, which might be beneficial for understanding the emergence and re-emergence of yellow fever as an important global public health issue.

The Rift Valley fever virus can be transmitted by body fluids, and the most common way for humans to get infected is from animals. The virus is also vector-borne and can be transmitted by many species of mosquitoes. As with other vector-borne diseases, the epidemiology may vary in response to environmental changes. Here the effects of climate and land use changes on Rift Valley fever, as well as on other vector-borne diseases, are discussed. The effect of irrigation in East Africa on inter-epidemic transmission of RVF is discussed in greater detail, followed by recommendations for future research and actions.

Ferrets were exposed to oral fluids collected from dogs after canine exposure to HeV. Observations made and samples tested post-exposure were used to assess the clinical course and replication sites of HeV in dogs, the infectivity for ferrets of canine oral fluids and features of HeV infection in dogs following contact with infective blood.Results Dogs were reliably infected with HeV and were generally asymptomatic. HeV was re-isolated from the oral cavity and virus clearance was associated with development of virus neutralising antibody. Major sites of HeV replication in dogs were the tonsils, lower respiratory tract and associated lymph nodes. Virus replication was documented in canine kidney and spleen, confirming a viraemic phase for canine HeV infection and suggesting that urine may be a source of infectious virus. Infection was transmitted to ferrets via canine oral secretions, with copy numbers for the HeV N gene in canine oral swabs comparable to those reported for nasal swabs of experimentally infected horses.Conclusion HeV is not highly pathogenic for dogs, but their oral secretions pose a potential transmission risk to people. The timewindow for transmission risk is circumscribed and corresponds to the period of acute infection before establishment of an adaptive immune response. The likelihood of central nervous system involvement in canine HeV infection is unclear, as is any long-term consequence.																					WOS:000393334900023	28124415

CRC etiology entails both genetic and environmental factors. Macroautophagy/autophagy and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are fundamental mechanisms involved in the regulation of cellular responses to environmental and genetic stresses. Both pathways are interconnected and regulate cellular responses to apoptotic stimuli. In this review, we address the epidemiology and risk factors of CRC, including genetic mutations leading to the occurrence of the disease. Next, we discuss mutations of genes related to autophagy and the UPR in CRC. Then, we discuss how autophagy and the UPR are involved in the regulation of CRC and how they associate with obesity and inflammatory responses in CRC. Finally, we provide perspectives for the modulation of autophagy and the UPR as new therapeutic options for CRC treatment.																					WOS:000401707200002	28358273

Identification of Novel 5,6-Dimethoxyindan-1-one Derivatives as Antiviral Agents								MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY				13	8			787	795		10.2174/1573406413666170330094822				2017	2017	Background: Discovery of novel antiviral agents is essential because viral infection continues to threaten human life globally. Various heterocyclic small molecules have been developed as antiviral agents. The 5,6-dimethoxyindan-1-on nucleus is of considerable interest as this ring is the key constituent in a range of bioactive compounds, both naturally occurring and synthetic, and often of considerable complexity.Objective: The main purpose of this research was to discover and develop small molecule heterocycles as broad-spectrum of antiviral agents.Method: A focused small set of 5,6-dimethoxyindan-1-one analogs (6-8) along with a thiopene derivative (9) was screened for selected viruses (Vaccinia virus - VACA, Human papillomavirus HPV, Zika virus - ZIKV, Dengue virus - DENV, Measles virus - MV, Poliovirus 3 - PV, Rift Valley fever virus - RVFV, Tacaribe virus - TCRV, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus - VEEV, Herpes simplex virus 1 -HSV-1 and Human cytomegalovirus - HCMV) using the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)'s Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) antiviral screening program.Results: These molecules demonstrated moderate to excellent antiviral activity towards variety of viruses. The 5,6-dimethoxyindan-1-one analog (7) demonstrated high efficacy towards vaccinia virus (EC50: < 0.05 mu M) and was nearly 232 times more potent than the standard drug Cidofovir (EC50: 11.59 mu M) in primary assay whereas it demonstrated moderate activity (EC50: > 30.00 mu M) in secondary plaque reduction assay. The thiophene analog (9) has shown very good viral inhibition towards several viruses such as Human papillomavirus, Measles virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Tacaribe virus and Herpes simplex virus 1.Conclusion: Our research identified a novel 5,6-dimethoxyindan-1-one analog (compound 7), as a potent antiviral agent for vaccinia virus, and heterocyclic chalcone analog (compound 9) as a broad spectrum antiviral agent.

It is associated with up to 63% of all acute respiratory infections and up to 81% of all viral lower respiratory tract infections causing hospitalization in infants and young children. RSV leads to seasonal epidemics between November and April in the northern hemisphere. Most severe infections (RSV accounts for 50 to 80% of all cause bronchiolitis) affect infants younger than 6 months of age and high-risk infants including those born preterm with or without bronchopulmonary dysplasia and those with hemodynamically significant congenital heart disease up to an age of 24 months. Palivizumab, a highly potent RSV-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (Mab), has been licensed in 1998 for prophylactic use to prevent RSV associated hospitalizations in high-risk infants. This Mab is given by monthly intramuscular injection at a dose of 15 mg/kg over the RSV season (up to 5 times). Palivizumab proved to be safe and well-tolerated in this population. Concerns have been raised regarding cost-effectiveness of palivizumab and thus, palivizumab prophylaxis is mainly limited to selected high-risk infants for the first RSV season. Long-lasting Mabs will be the next future approach in the prophylaxis of RSV hospitalization until a vaccine is developed.																					WOS:000413705700034	28605249

ILAR JOURNAL				58	3			359	370		10.1093/ilar/ilx023				2017	2017	Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus (RVFV) is an emerging vector-borne pathogen that causes sporadic epizootics and epidemics with multi-year, apparently quiescent, inter-epidemic periods. The epidemiology and ecology of the virus during these inter-epidemic periods is poorly understood. There is evidence for low-level circulation of the virus in livestock and wild ruminants; however, as of yet there is no evidence to identify a specific mammalian reservoir host. Using a systematic approach, this review synthesizes results from serosurveys, attempts at viral detection, and experimental infection of wildlife. These data demonstrate there is a gap in research conducted on RVF in wild ruminants. Specifically, there is very little published data on the pathogenicity of an RVFV infection in various wildlife species, validation of diagnostic assays for exposure to RVFV and understanding of epizootic or endemic disease dynamics in wild ruminants. We recommend that future research on RVFV incorporate a more systematic approach to understand the low-level cycling of the virus during inter-epidemic periods in both wild and domestic ruminant species.

Most infect mammals and birds. Many flaviviruses are host-specific and pathogenic, such as hepatitis C virus in the genus Hepacivirus. The majority of known members in the genus Flavivirus are arthropod borne, and many are important human and veterinary pathogens (e.g. yellow fever virus, dengue virus).

Peromyscus as a model system for human hepatitis C: An opportunity to advance our understanding of a complex host parasite system								SEMINARS IN CELL & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY				61				123	130		10.1016/j.semcdb.2016.07.031				JAN 2017	2017	Worldwide, there are 185 million people infected with hepatitis C virus and approximately 350,000 people die each year from hepatitis C associated liver diseases. Human hepatitis C research has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate in vivo model system. Most of the in vivo research has been conducted on chimpanzees, which is complicated by ethical concerns, small sample sizes, high costs, and genetic heterogeneity. The house mouse system has led to greater understanding of a wide variety of human pathogens, but it is unreasonable to expect Mus musculus to be a good model system for every human pathogen. Alternative animal models can be developed in these cases. Ferrets (influenza), cotton rats (human respiratory virus), and woodchucks (hepatitis B) are all alternative models that have led to a greater understanding of human pathogens. Rodent models are tractable, genetically amenable and inbred and outbred strains can provide homogeneity in results. Recently, a rodent homolog of hepatitis C was discovered and isolated from the liver of a Peromyscus maniculatus. This represents the first small mammal (mouse) model system for human hepatitis C and it offers great potential to contribute to our understanding and ultimately aid in our efforts to combat this serious public health concern. Peromyscus are available commercially and can be used to inform questions about the origin, transmission, persistence, pathology, and rational treatment of hepatitis C. Here, we provide a disease ecologist's overview of this new virus and some suggestions for useful future experiments. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Human Monkeypox: Current State of Knowledge and Implications for the Future								TROPICAL MEDICINE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE				1	1					8	10.3390/tropicalmed1010008				DEC 20 2016	2016	The zoonosis human monkeypox (MPX) was discovered in 1970, twelve years after the discovery of monkeypox virus (MPXV) in a Danish laboratory in 1958. Historically confined to West Africa (WA) and the Congo basin (CB), new epidemics in Sudan and the United States of America (USA) have fuelled new research highlighting environmental factors contributing to the expanded geographical spread of monkeypox virus (MPXV). A systematic literature review was conducted in MEDLINE(R)(Ovid), MEDLINE(R)(PubMed) and Google Scholar databases using the search terms: monkeypox, MPXV and "human monkeypox". The literature revealed MPX has classic prodromal symptoms followed by a total body rash. The sole distinguishing clinical characteristic from other pox-like illnesses is the profound lymphadenopathy. Laboratory diagnosis of MPX is essential, a suitable test for endemic areas is under development but not yet available. For the time being anti-poxvirus antibodies in an unvaccinated individual with a history of severe illness and rash can suggest MPX infection. The reservoir host remains elusive yet the rope squirrel and Gambian pouched rat appear to be the most likely candidates. Transmission includes fomite, droplet, direct contact with infected humans or animals and consumption of infected meat. Though smallpox vaccination is protective against MPXV, new non-immune generations contribute to increasing incidence. Environmental factors are increasing the frequency of contact with potential hosts, thus increasing the risk of animal-to-human transmission. Increased risk of transmission through globalisation, conflict and environmental influences makes MPX a more realistic threat to previously unaffected countries. Health worker training and further development and accessibility of suitable diagnostic tests, vaccinations and anti-viral treatment is becoming increasingly necessary.

J	Anggakusuma; Brown, Richard J. P.; Banda, Dominic H.; Todt, Daniel; Vieyres, Gabrielle; Steinmann, Eike; Pietschmann, Thomas								Hepacivirus NS3/4A Proteases Interfere with MAVS Signaling in both Their Cognate Animal Hosts and Humans: Implications for Zoonotic Transmissions								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				90	23			10670	10681		10.1128/JVI.01634-16				DEC 2016	2016	Multiple novel members of the genus Hepacivirus have recently been discovered in diverse mammalian species. However, to date, their replication mechanisms and zoonotic potential have not been explored in detail. The NS3/4A serine protease of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is critical for cleavage of the viral polyprotein. It also cleaves the cellular innate immune adaptor MAVS, thus decreasing interferon (IFN) production and contributing to HCV persistence in the human host. To investigate the conservation of fundamental aspects of the hepaciviral life cycle, we explored if MAVS cleavage and suppression of innate immune signaling represent a common mechanism employed across different clades of the genus Hepacivirus to enhance viral replication. To estimate the zoonotic potential of these nonhuman hepaciviruses, we assessed if their NS3/4A proteases were capable of cleaving human MAVS. NS3/4A proteases of viruses infecting colobus monkeys, rodents, horses, and cows cleaved the MAVS proteins of their cognate hosts and interfered with the ability of MAVS to induce the IFN-beta promoter. All NS3/4A proteases from nonhuman viruses readily cleaved human MAVS. Thus, NS3/4A-dependent cleavage of MAVS is a conserved replication strategy across multiple clades within the genus Hepacivirus. Human MAVS is susceptible to cleavage by these nonhuman viral proteases, indicating that it does not pose a barrier for zoonotic transmission of these viruses to humans.IMPORTANCEVirus infection is recognized by cellular sensor proteins triggering innate immune signaling and antiviral defenses. While viruses have evolved strategies to thwart these antiviral programs in their cognate host species, these evasion mechanisms are often ineffective in a novel host, thus limiting viral transmission across species. HCV, the best-characterized member of the genus Hepacivirus within the family Flaviviridae, uses its NS3/4A protease to disrupt innate immune signaling by cleaving the cellular adaptor protein MAVS. Recently, a large number of HCV-related viruses have been discovered in various animal species, including wild, livestock, and companion animals. We show that the NS3/4A proteases of these hepaciviruses from different animals and representing various clades of the genus cleave their cognate host MAVS proteins in addition to human MAVS. Therefore, cleavage of MAVS is a common strategy of hepaciviruses, and human MAVS is likely unable to limit replication of these nonhuman viruses upon zoonotic exposure.

No Evidence of Dengue Virus Infections in Several Species of Bats Captured in Central and Southern Mexico								ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH				63	8			579	583		10.1111/zph.12276				DEC 2016	2016	Bats are reservoirs for viruses with zoonotic potential in the Americas, and scattered evidence exists suggesting that bats may act as reservoirs for dengue virus (DENV). To explore further the role of bats as part of DENV sylvatic cycles, 240 bats of 18 species were captured in 2 states of Mexico with contrasting ecological characteristics but concurrent DENV activity in humans. RT-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from liver or spleen tissue from de bats failed to show evidence for the presence of DENV nucleic acids in these organs. In addition, plasma assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test showed no evidence of neutralizing anti-DENV antibodies. These results suggest that American bats may not be reservoirs or amplification host for DENV infection.																					WOS:000389148700001	27357156

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of JEV infection in commensal and field rodents in South China. Materials and Methods: RNA copies of JEV were detected in brain samples of rodents using real-time RT-PCR. Detection of serum against JEV-reactive antibodies was performed using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and microneutralization test. Results: In total, 198 rodents were collected from Guangzhou City and Xiamen City between November 2013 and May 2014. JEV RNA was not detected in 188 brain samples. Forty-four in 96 serum samples (45.8%) were positive for JEV-reactive IgG antibodies. The prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to against JEV-reactive in these serum samples was 61.5% (24/39), with titers ranging from 1:10 to 1:56. Conclusion: Rodents are not known to play a role in transmission of JEV in Asia, nor is there an evidence to support a role for rodents in transmission of other related flaviviruses in China. However, in the current study, we detected evidence of JEV-reactive antibodies in large numbers of Rattus norvegicus and Rattus losea Swinhoe. Further studies of rodents as potential hosts of JEV or other related flaviviruses are warranted.																					WOS:000390243200007	27828763

The Global Phylogeography of Lyssaviruses - Challenging the 'Out of Africa' Hypothesis								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				10	12					e0005266	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005266				DEC 2016	2016	Rabies virus kills tens of thousands of people globally each year, especially in resource-limited countries. Yet, there are genetically-and antigenically-related lyssaviruses, all capable of causing the disease rabies, circulating globally among bats without causing conspicuous disease outbreaks. The species richness and greater genetic diversity of African lyssaviruses, along with the lack of antibody cross-reactivity among them, has led to the hypothesis that Africa is the origin of lyssaviruses. This hypothesis was tested using a probabilistic phylogeographical approach. The nucleoprotein gene sequences from 153 representatives of 16 lyssavirus species, collected between 1956 and 2015, were used to develop a phylogenetic tree which incorporated relevant geographic and temporal data relating to the viruses. In addition, complete genome sequences from all 16 (putative) species were analysed. The most probable ancestral distribution for the internal nodes was inferred using three different approaches and was confirmed by analysis of complete genomes. These results support a Palearctic origin for lyssaviruses (posterior probability = 0.85), challenging the 'out of Africa' hypothesis, and suggest three independent transmission events to the Afrotropical region, representing the three phylogroups that form the three major lyssavirus clades.

Identifying specific immune processes requires new specific tools and reagents. In this study, we describe a new mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) reactive with Eptesicus fuscus immunoglobulins. The epitope recognized by mAb BT1-4F10 was localized to immunoglobulin light (lambda) chains; hence, the mAb recognized serum immunoglobulins and B lymphocytes. The BT1-4F10 epitope appeared to be restricted to Microchiropteran immunoglobulins and absent from Megachiropteran immunoglobulins. Analyses of sera and other E. fuscus fluids showed that most, if not all, secreted immunoglobulins utilized lambda light chains. Finally, mAb BT1-4F10 permitted the identification of B cell follicles in splenic white pulp. This Microchiropteran-specific mAb has potential utility in seroassays; hence, this reagent may have both basic and practical applications for studying immune process. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The disease also occurs naturally in cats, and can be induced experimentally in laboratory rodents and numerous other mammals. Borna disease virus-1 (BoDV-1), the cause of most cases of mammalian Borna disease, is a negative-stranded RNA virus that replicates within the nucleus of target cells. It causes severe, often lethal, encephalitis in susceptible species. Recent events, especially the discovery of numerous new species of bornaviruses in birds and a report of an acute, lethal bornaviral encephalitis in humans, apparently acquired from squirrels, have revived interest in this remarkable family of viruses. The clinical manifestations of the bornaviral diseases are highly variable. Thus, in addition to acute lethal encephalitis, they can cause persistent neurologic disease associated with diverse behavioral changes. They also cause a severe retinitis resulting in blindness. In this review, we discuss both the pathological lesions observed in mammalian bornaviral disease and the complex pathogenesis of the neurologic disease. Thus infected neurons may be destroyed by T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity. They may die as a result of excessive inflammatory cytokine release from microglia. They may also die as a result of a glutaminergic storm' due to a failure of infected astrocytes to regulate brain glutamate levels.																					WOS:000395396800004	27212192

Rabies pre-exposure prophylaxis elicits long-lasting immunity in humans								VACCINE				34	48			5959	5967		10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.09.058				NOV 21 2016	2016	Despite the availability of safe and effective human vaccines, rabies remains a global threat, with an estimated 60,000 human deaths annually attributed to rabies. Pre-exposure prophylaxis against rabies infection is recommended for travelers to countries where rabies is endemic, and also for those with a higher risk of exposure. In this study, the rabies-specific neutralising antibody responses in a cohort of rabies vaccinated recipients over a period of twenty years have been assessed. In particular, the antibody response to primary vaccinations and boosters, and the waning of antibody post primary vaccination and post booster were investigated. The significance of gender, age at vaccination, vaccine manufacturer and vaccination intervals were also evaluated. These data confirm that rabies vaccination can elicit a neutralising antibody response that can remain at detectable levels for a number of years, without additional booster vaccinations. The antibody response following both primary vaccination and booster was significantly influenced by the gender of the subject (p = 0.002 and 0.03 respectively), with supportive data that suggests an effect by the make of vaccine administered following primary vaccination, with significantly higher VNA titres observed for one vaccine manufactured prior to 2006 (p < 0.001) in a small subset of recipients (n = 5). Additionally, the decay rate was demonstrated through the overall decline in antibody titre for all individuals, which was a 37% and 27% reduction per 2-fold change in time following primary and booster vaccination respectively. Individuals within older age groups demonstrated a significantly faster decline in antibody titre following the primary vaccination course (p = 0.012). Rate of decline in antibody titre was also significantly influenced by the vaccine make following primary course (p < 0.001). The assessment of neutralising antibody titre decline has also provided an insight into the most appropriate timing for booster administration, and enabled the prediction of long term titres from post-vaccination antibody titres.

Assignments into 14 Hepacivirus species (Hepacivirus A-N) and 11 Pegivirus species (Pegivirus A-K) are based on phylogenetic relationships and sequence distances between conserved regions extracted from complete coding sequences for members of each proposed taxon. We propose that the species Hepatitis C virus is renamed Hepacivirus C in order to acknowledge its unique historical position and so as to minimize confusion. Despite the newly documented genetic diversity of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, members of these genera remain phylogenetically distinct, and differ in hepatotropism and the possession of a basic core protein; pegiviruses in general lack these features. However, other characteristics that were originally used to support their division into separate genera are no longer definitive; there is overlap between the two genera in the type of internal ribosomal entry site and the presence of miR-122 sites in the 5' UTR, the predicted number of N-linked glycosylation sites in the envelope E1 and E2 proteins, the presence of poly U tracts in the 3' UTR and the propensity of viruses to establish a persistent infection. While all classified hepaciviruses and pegiviruses have mammalian hosts, the recent description of a hepaci-/pegi-like virus from a shark and the likely existence of further homologues in other non-mammalian species indicate that further species or genera remain to be defined in the future.

J	Bukh, Jens								The history of hepatitis C virus (HCV): Basic research reveals unique features in phylogeny, evolution and the viral life cycle with new perspectives for epidemic control								JOURNAL OF HEPATOLOGY				65				S2	S21		10.1016/j.jhep.2016.07.035			1	OCT 2016	2016	The discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 1989 permitted basic research to unravel critical components of a complex life cycle for this important human pathogen. HCV is a highly divergent group of viruses classified in 7 major genotypes and a great number of subtypes, and circulating in infected individuals as a continuously evolving quasispecies destined to escape host immune responses and applied antivirals. Despite the inability to culture patient viruses directly in the laboratory, efforts to define the infectious genome of HCV resulted in development of experimental recombinant in vivo and in vitro systems, including replicons and infectious cultures in human hepatoma cell lines. And HCV has become a model virus defining new paradigms in virology, immunology and biology. For example, HCV research discovered that a virus could be completely dependent on microRNA for its replication since microRNA-122 is critical for the HCV life cycle. A number of other host molecules critical for HCV entry and replication have been identified. Thus, basic HCV research revealed important molecules for development of host targeting agents (HTA). The identification and characterization of HCV encoded proteins and their functional units contributed to the development of highly effective direct acting antivirals (DAA) against the NS3 protease, NS5A and the NS5B polymerase. In combination, these inhibitors have since 2014 permitted interferon-free therapy with cure rates above 90% among patients with chronic HCV infection; however, viral resistance represents a challenge. Worldwide control of HCV will most likely require the development of a prophylactic vaccine, and numerous candidates have been pursued. Research characterizing features critical for antibody-based virus neutralization and T cell based virus elimination from infected cells is essential for this effort. If the world community promotes an ambitious approach by applying current DAA broadly, continues to develop alternative viral- and host targeted antivirals to combat resistant variants, and invests in the development of a vaccine, it would be possible to eradicate HCV. This would prevent about 500 thousand deaths annually. However, given the nature of HCV, the millions of new infections annually, a high chronicity rate, and with over 150 million individuals with chronic infection (which are frequently unidentified), this effort remains a major challenge for basic researchers, clinicians and communities.

In this study, we evaluated the impact of natural killer (NK) cells and myeloid (mDCs) and plasmacytoid (pDCs) dendritic cells on control of virus replication and virus-induced pathology caused by another, more rapidly resolving hepacivirus, GB virus B (GBV-B), in infections of common marmosets. High plasma and liver viral loads and robust hepatitis characterized acute GBV-B infection, and while viremia was generally cleared by 2 to 3 months postinfection, hepatitis and liver fibrosis persisted after clearance. Coinciding with peak viral loads and liver pathology, the levels of NK cells, mDCs, and pDCs in the liver increased up to 3-fold. Although no obvious numerical changes in peripheral innate cells occurred, circulating NK cells exhibited increased perforin and Ki67 expression levels and increased surface expression of CXCR3. These data suggested that increased NK cell arming and proliferation as well as tissue trafficking may be associated with influx into the liver during acute infection. Indeed, NK cell frequencies in the liver positively correlated with plasma (R = 0.698; P = 0.015) and liver (R = 0.567; P = 0.057) viral loads. Finally, soluble factors associated with NK cells and DCs, including gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and RANTES, were increased in acute infection and also were associated with viral loads and hepatitis. Collectively, the findings showed that mobilization of local and circulating innate immune responses was linked to acute virus-induced hepatitis, and potentially to resolution of GBV-B infection, and our results may provide insight into similar mechanisms in HCV infection.IMPORTANCEHepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has created a global health crisis, and despite new effective antivirals, it is still a leading cause of liver disease and death worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that innate immunity may be a potential therapeutic target for HCV, but it may also be a correlate of increased disease. Due to a lack of access to human tissues with acute HCV infection, in this study we evaluated the role of innate immunity in resolving infection with a hepacivirus, GBV-B, in common marmosets. Collectively, our data suggest that NK cell and DC mobilization in acute hepacivirus infection can dampen virus replication but also regulate acute and chronic liver damage. How these two opposing effects on the host may be modulated in future therapeutic and vaccine approaches warrants further study.																					WOS:000384574900023	27489267

Infection with this virus causes severe illness and abortion in sheep, goats, and cattle as well as other domestic animals. Humans can also be exposed through close contact with infectious tissues or by bites from infected mosquitoes, primarily of the Aedes and Culex genuses. Although the cycle of RVFV infection in savannah regions is well documented, its distribution in forest areas in central Africa has been poorly investigated.Methodology/Principal FindingsTo evaluate current circulation of RVFV among livestock and humans living in the Central African Republic (CAR), blood samples were collected from sheep, cattle, and goats and from people at risk, such as stock breeders and workers in slaughterhouses and livestock markets. The samples were tested for anti-RVFV immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We also sequenced the complete genomes of two local strains, one isolated in 1969 from mosquitoes and one isolated in 1985 from humans living in forested areas. The 1271 animals sampled comprised 727 cattle, 325 sheep, and 219 goats at three sites. The overall seroprevalence of anti-RVFV IgM antibodies was 1.9% and that of IgG antibodies was 8.6%. IgM antibodies were found only during the rainy season, but the frequency of IgG antibodies did not differ significantly by season. No evidence of recent RVFV infection was found in 335 people considered at risk; however, 16.7% had evidence of past infection. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the strains isolated in the CAR with those isolated in other African countries showed that they belonged to the East/Central African cluster.Conclusion and significanceThis study confirms current circulation of RVFV in CAR. Further studies are needed to determine the potential vectors involved and the virus reservoirs.																					WOS:000386676200057	27760144

David								4EBP-Dependent Signaling Supports West Nile Virus Growth and Protein Expression								VIRUSES-BASEL				8	10					287	10.3390/v8100287				OCT 2016	2016	West Nile virus (WNV) is a (+) sense, single-stranded RNA virus in the Flavivirus genus. WNV RNA possesses an (m7)GpppN(m) 5 cap with 2-O-methylation that mimics host mRNAs preventing innate immune detection and allowing the virus to translate its RNA genome through the utilization of cap-dependent translation initiation effectors in a wide variety of host species. Our prior work established the requirement of the host mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) for optimal WNV growth and protein expression; yet, the roles of the downstream effectors of mTORC1 in WNV translation are unknown. In this study, we utilize gene deletion mutants in the ribosomal protein kinase called S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) pathways downstream of mTORC1 to define the role of mTOR-dependent translation initiation signals in WNV gene expression and growth. We now show that WNV growth and protein expression are dependent on mTORC1 mediated-regulation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP/eIF4E) interaction and eukaryotic initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex formation to support viral growth and viral protein expression. We also show that the canonical signals of mTORC1 activation including ribosomal protein s6 (rpS6) and S6K phosphorylation are not required for WNV growth in these same conditions. Our data suggest that the mTORC1/4EBP/eIF4E signaling axis is activated to support the translation of the WNV genome.																					WOS:000387482200022

Human African trypanosomiasis is an important constraint on human well-being in sub-Saharan Africa, and spillover transmission occurs from the reservoir community of wild mammals. Here we use robust and repeatable methodology to generate baseline datasets on vegetation and mammal density to investigate the ecology of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) in the remote Luambe National Park in Zambia, in order to further our understanding of their interactions with tsetse (Glossina spp.) vectors of trypanosomiasis. Fuzzy set theory is used to produce an accurate landcover classification, and distance sampling techniques are applied to obtain species and habitat level density estimates for the most abundant wild mammals. The density of warthog burrows is also estimated and thr spatial distribution mapped. The datasets generated provide an accurate baeiseline to further ecological and epidemiological understanding of disease systems such as trypanosomiasis. This study provides a reliable framework for ecological monitoring of wild mammal densities and vegetation composition in remote, relatively inaccessible environments.

Currently, six types of viruses are designated hepatitis viruses (A, B, C, D, E, and G), although only five of these cause hepatitis. Hepatitis viruses are composed of RNA and DNA viruses from different families and with different virologic properties, some of which typically cause acute hepatitis while others cause acute and chronic hepatitis. In addition to their role in liver disease, members of this group of viruses may cause a variety of pathologic changes in the kidney and other organs, and chronic infection may lead to cirrhosis in addition to raising a variety of important issues in the management of kidney transplant recipients. In this brief report, we review the virologic and clinical properties of each of the hepatitis viruses, and highlight the role of each virus in renal disease and kidney transplantation.

The objective of the present study was to develop a geographic knowledge-based method to map the areas suitable for RVF amplification and RVF spread in four East African countries, namely, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia, and to assess the predictive accuracy of the model using livestock outbreak data from Kenya and Tanzania. Risk factors and their relative importance regarding RVF amplification and spread were identified from a literature review. A numerical weight was calculated for each risk factor using an analytical hierarchy process. The corresponding geographic data were collected, standardized and combined based on a weighted linear combination to produce maps of the suitability for RVF transmission. The accuracy of the resulting maps was assessed using RVF outbreak locations in livestock reported in Kenya and Tanzania between 1998 and 2012 and the ROC curve analysis. Our results confirmed the capacity of the geographic information system-based multi-criteria evaluation method to synthesize available scientific knowledge and to accurately map (AUC = 0.786; 95% CI [0.730-0.842]) the spatial heterogeneity of RVF suitability in East Africa. This approach provides users with a straightforward and easy update of the maps according to data availability or the further development of scientific knowledge.

Human pegivirus A (HPgV; GB virus type C) sequences were identified in eight of the 10 pools, more than 90% of which belong to Genotype 2. The recently described human HPgV2 in Flaviviridae was not detected. A small number of sequence reads of human papillomavirus were also detected in three pools. In one pool, two different gemycircularvirus genomes were identified and fully sequenced. The capsid protein of one gemycircularvirus shared 83% to 84% identity to those of genomes from human serum and sewage. The presence of the gemycircularvirus genomes in the plasma pool was independently confirmed and the viral concentration estimated by digital PCR at more than 10(6) copies/mL assuming their origin from single donors.CONCLUSION: Further research is required to elucidate whether gemycircularviruses can infect humans or are indicative of contamination occurring during phlebotomy, plasma pool processing, or ongoing donor fungal infections.

J	Wu, Haoming; Padhi, Abinash; Xu, Junqiang; Gong, Xiaoyan; Tien, Po								Evidence for Within-Host Genetic Recombination among the Human Pegiviral Strains in HIV Infected Subjects								PLOS ONE				11	8					e0161880	10.1371/journal.pone.0161880				AUG 25 2016	2016	The non-pathogenic Human Pegivirus ( HPgV, formerly GBV-C/HGV), the most prevalent RNA virus worldwide, is known to be associated with reduced morbidity and mortality in HIV-infected individuals. Although previous studies documented its ubiquity and important role in HIV-infected individuals, little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms that maintain high genetic diversity of HPgV within the HIV-infected individuals. To assess the within-host genetic diversity of HPgV and forces that maintain such diversity within the co-infected hosts, we performed phylogenetic analyses taking into account 229 HPgV partial E1-E2 clonal sequences representing 15 male and 8 female co-infected HIV patients from Hubei province of central China. Our results revealed the presence of eleven strongly supported clades. While nine clades belonged to genotype 3, two clades belonged to genotype 2. Additionally, four clades that belonged to genotype 3 exhibited inter-clade recombination events. The presence of clonal sequences representing multiple clades within the HIV-infected individual provided the evidence of co-circulation of HPgV strains across the region. Of the 23 patients, six patients (i.e., five males and one female) were detected to have HPgV recombinant sequences. Our results also revealed that while male patients shared the viral strains with other patients, viral strains from the female patients had restricted dispersal. Taken together, the present study revealed that multiple infections with divergent HPgV viral strains may have caused within-host genetic recombination, predominantly in male patients, and therefore, could be the major driver in shaping genetic diversity of HPgV.

It is currently found in parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where periodic outbreaks of severe and fatal disease occur, and threatens to spread into other geographic regions. In recent years, modern molecular techniques have led to many breakthroughs deepening our understanding of the mechanisms of RVFV virulence, phylogenetics, and the creation of several next-generation vaccine candidates. Despite tremendous progress in these areas, other challenges remain in RVF disease pathogenesis, the virus life cycle, and outbreak response preparedness that deserve our attention. Here we discuss and highlight ten key knowledge gaps and challenges in RVFV research. Answers to these key questions may lead to the development of new effective therapeutics and enhanced control strategies for this serious human and veterinary health threat.

WNV activity in Mexico has been reported in several domestic and wild fauna and in humans, and the virus has been isolated from birds, mosquitoes, and humans. However, no serological studies have been conducted in monkeys, and only two in a limited number of crocodiles (Crocodylus moreletii). Here we present data on the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against WNV in 53 healthy wild monkeys (49 Ateles geoffroyi and four Alouatta pigra), and 80 semi-captive healthy crocodiles (60 C. acutus and 20 C. acutus-C. moreletti hybrids) sampled during 2012. None of the monkey sera neutralized WNV, whereas 55% of the crocodile sera presented neutralizing antibodies against WNV. These results can contribute to the design of surveillance programmes in Mexico.																					WOS:000379785200016	27097655

Numerous studies strongly support the notion that persistent coinfection with non-pathogenic virus prolongs survival in HIV-1 infected individuals. Coinfected individuals show higher CD4+ cell counts, lower HIV-1 RNA viral loads and live three times longer than clinically matched HIV-1 monoinfected patients. We have previously shown that one of the major anti-HIV defenses conferred by GBV-C coinfection is the upregulation of intracellular miRNAs in CD4+ cells that share significant mutual homologies with GBV-C and HIV-1 (>80%) genomes.Methodology: Genome-wide bioinformatics analyses were carried out to search for miRNA binding sites in mutual homologies between HIV and several members of the FlaviviridaeResults: Several miRNAs shared significant mutual homology with HIV-1 genetic sequences and GBV-A, B, C, DV, WNV and YFV. These may be responsible for beneficial effects in HIV-1 infected individuals. Three highly mutual homologous miRNAs (i.e. miR-627-5, miR-369-5 and miR-548f), expressed in CD4+ cell lines, reduce HIV-1 replication by up to 90% whereas miRNAs with low mutual homologies (i.e. miR-34-1 and miR-508) impart only slight inhibition of HIV-1.Conclusion: We hypothesize that a recombinant GBV-C-based vector can be constructed which expresses several beneficial genetic motifs of the Flaviviridae without causing any side effects while stimulating a wide array of beneficial miRNAs that can more efficiently prevent HIV-1 infection.

Since its first appearance in 1994, spillovers of HeV from its natural reservoir fruit bats occur on almost an annual basis. The high mortality rate in both humans and horses and the wide-ranging reservoir distribution are making HeV a serious public health problem, especially for people exposed to sick horses. This study has aimed to develop an efficient low-cost HeV vaccine for horses based on Canarypox recombinant vector expressing HeV glycoproteins, attachment glycoprotein (G) and fusion protein (F). This vaccine was used to immunise hamsters and then challenged intraperitoneally with HeV 3 weeks later. The higher tested dose of the vaccine efficiently prevented oropharyngeal virus shedding and protected animals from clinical disease and virus-induced mortality. Vaccine induced generation of seroneutralising antibodies and prevented virus-induced histopathological changes and a production of viral RNA and antigens in animal tissues. Interestingly, some vaccinated animals, including those immunised at a lower dose, were protected in the absence of detectable specific antibodies, suggesting the induction of an efficient virus-specific cellular immunity. Finally, ponies immunised using the same vaccination protocol as hamsters developed strong seroneutralising titres against both HeV and closely related Nipah virus, indicating that this vaccine may have the ability to induce cross-protection against Henipavirus infection. These data suggest that Canarypox-based vectors encoding for HeV glycoproteins present very promising new vaccine candidate to prevent infection and shedding of the highly lethal HeV.

The ferret model has emerged as the preferred small-animal model with which to study NiV disease, but much is still unknown about the viral determinants of NiV pathogenesis, including the contribution of the C protein in ferrets. Additionally, studies have yet to examine the synergistic effects of the various P gene products on pathogenesis in animal models. Using recombinant NiVs (rNiVs), we examine the sole contribution of the NiV C protein and the combined contributions of the C and W proteins in the ferret model of NiV pathogenesis. We show that an rNiV void of C expression resulted in 100% mortality, though with limited respiratory disease, like our previously reported rNiV void of W expression; this finding is in stark contrast to the attenuated phenotype observed in previous hamster studies utilizing rNiVs void of C expression. We also observed that an rNiV void of both C and W expression resulted in limited respiratory disease; however, there was severe neurological disease leading to 60% mortality, and the surviving ferrets demonstrated sequelae similar to those for human survivors of NiV encephalitis.

Members of the Phlebovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae are transmitted by mosquitos and ticks to humans and include highly pathogenic agents like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) as well as viruses that do not cause disease in humans, like Uukuniemi virus (UUKV). Phleboviruses and other bunyaviruses use their envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, for entry into target cells and for assembly of progeny particles in infected cells. Thus, binding of Gn and Gc to cell surface factors promotes viral attachment and uptake into cells and exposure to endosomal low pH induces Gc-driven fusion of the viral and the vesicle membranes. Moreover, Gn and Gc facilitate virion incorporation of the viral genome via their intracellular domains and Gn and Gc interactions allow the formation of a highly ordered glycoprotein lattice on the virion surface. Studies conducted in the last decade provided important insights into the configuration of phlebovirus Gn and Gc proteins in the viral membrane, the cellular factors used by phleboviruses for entry and the mechanisms employed by phlebovirus Gc proteins for membrane fusion. Here, we will review our knowledge on the glycoprotein biogenesis and the role of Gn and Gc proteins in the phlebovirus replication cycle.																					WOS:000380766700024	27455305

HeV appeared in Queensland, Australia in 1994 causing a severe respiratory disease in horses along with a human case fatality. NiV emerged a few years later in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-1999 causing a large outbreak of encephalitis with high mortality in people and also respiratory disease in pigs which served as amplifying hosts. The key pathological elements of HeV and NiV infection in several species of mammals, and also in people, are a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. In people, both HeV and NiV are also capable of causing relapsed encephalitis following recovery from an acute infection. The known reservoir hosts of HeV and NiV are several species of pteropid fruit bats. Spillovers of HeV into horses continue to occur in Australia and NiV has caused outbreaks in people in Bangladesh and India nearly annually since 2001, making HeV and NiV important transboundary biological threats. NiV in particular possesses several features that underscore its potential as a pandemic threat, including its ability to infect humans directly from natural reservoirs or indirectly from other susceptible animals, along with a capacity of limited human-to-human transmission. Several HeV and NiV animal challenge models have been developed which have facilitated an understanding of pathogenesis and allowed for the successful development of both active and passive immunization countermeasures.

A Recombinant Rift Valley Fever Virus Glycoprotein Subunit Vaccine Confers Full Protection against Rift Valley Fever Challenge in Sheep								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						27719	10.1038/srep27719				JUN 14 2016	2016	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic pathogen causing disease outbreaks in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. The virus has great potential for transboundary spread due to the presence of competent vectors in non-endemic areas. There is currently no fully licensed vaccine suitable for use in livestock or humans outside endemic areas. Here we report the evaluation of the efficacy of a recombinant subunit vaccine based on the RVFV Gn and Gc glycoproteins. In a previous study, the vaccine elicited strong virus neutralizing antibody responses in sheep and was DIVA (differentiating naturally infected from vaccinated animals) compatible. In the current efficacy study, a group of sheep (n=5) was vaccinated subcutaneously with the glycoprotein-based subunit vaccine candidate and then subjected to heterologous challenge with the virulent Kenya-128B-15 RVFV strain. The vaccine elicited high virus neutralizing antibody titers and conferred complete protection in all vaccinated sheep, as evidenced by prevention of viremia, fever and absence of RVFV-associated histopathological lesions. We conclude that the subunit vaccine platform represents a promising strategy for the prevention and control of RVFV infections in susceptible hosts.

Cascade-like diagnostics starting with the use of pan-influenza assays and subsequent subtyping devices are normally used. Here, we demonstrated a novel low density array combining 32 TaqMan (R) real-time RT-PCR systems in parallel for the specific detection of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) subtypes of avian and porcine hosts. The sensitivity of the newly developed system was compared with that of the pan-influenza assay, and the specificity of all RT-qPCRs was examined using a broad panel of 404 different influenza A virus isolates representing 45 different subtypes. Furthermore, we analysed the performance of the RT-qPCR assays with diagnostic samples obtained from wild birds and swine. Due to the open format of the array, adaptations to detect newly emerging influenza A virus strains can easily be integrated.

Information on WNV prevalence and circulation in Slovakia is insufficient. Oral and cloacal swabs and bird brain samples were tested for flavivirus RNA by RT-PCR using newly designed generic primers. The species designation was confirmed by sequencing. WNV was detected in swab and brain samples, whereas one brain sample was positive for tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). The WNV sequences clustered with lineages 1 and 2. These results confirm the circulation of WNV in birds in Slovakia and emphasize the risk of infection of humans and horses.

RVF virus dynamics have been poorly studied due to data scarcity. On the island of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, off the Southeastern African coast, RVF has been present since at least 2004. Several retrospective and prospective serological surveys in livestock have been conducted over eleven years (2004-15). These data are collated and presented here. Temporal patterns of seroprevalence were plotted against time, as well as age-stratified seroprevalence. Results suggest that RVF was already present in 2004-07. An epidemic occurred between 2008 and 2010, with IgG and IgM peak annual prevalences of 36% in 2008-09 (N = 142, n = 51, 95% CI [17-55]) and 41% (N = 96, n = 39, 95% CI [25-56]), respectively. The virus seems to be circulating at a low level since 2011, causing few new infections. In 2015, about 95% of the livestock population was susceptible (IgG annual prevalence was 6% (N = 584, n = 29, 95% CI [3-10])). Monthly rainfall varied a lot (2-540mm), whilst average temperature remained high with little variation (about 25-30 degrees C). This large dataset collected on an insular territory for more than 10 years, suggesting a past epidemic and a current inter-epidemic period, represents a unique opportunity to study RVF dynamics. Further data collection and modelling work may be used to test different scenarios of animal imports and rainfall pattern that could explain the observed epidemiological pattern and estimate the likelihood of a potential re-emergence.

Jake								Experimental models of hepatitis B and C - new insights and progress								NATURE REVIEWS GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY				13	6			362	374		10.1038/nrgastro.2016.37				JUN 2016	2016	Viral hepatitis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Hepatitis-causing viruses initiate disease by establishing both acute and chronic infections, and several of these viruses are specifically associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, intense research efforts have been focusing on increasing our understanding of hepatitis virus biology and on improving antiviral therapy and vaccination strategies. Although valuable information on viral hepatitis emerged from careful epidemiological studies on sporadic outbreaks in humans, experimental models using cell culture, rodent and non-human primates were essential in advancing the field. Through the use of these experimental models, improvement in both the treatment and prevention of viral hepatitis has progressed rapidly; however, agents of viral hepatitis are still among the most common pathogens infecting humans. In this Review, we describe the important part that these experimental models have played in the study of viral hepatitis and led to monumental advances in our understanding and treatment of these pathogens. Ongoing developments in experimental models are also described.																					WOS:000377487500008	27075261

Given that these viruses are the newest members of the Flaviviridae family, genomic information concerning circulating EqHV, EPgV and TDAV strains around the world is limited. To date, no genetic surveillance studies have been performed on these three viruses in the equine population of China. Here, a total of 177 serum samples were collected from equines across China between 2014 and 2015. Using PCR, we detected viral RNA in the serum samples, six of which were EqHV positive and two of which were EPgV positive. Co-infection with the two viruses was not observed among the Chinese equines studied, and TDAV RNA was not detected in the equine serum samples collected for this study. Phylogenetic analysis of partial NS5B open reading frame (ORF), NS3 ORF, and 5' untranslated region nucleotide sequences from EqHV as well as partial NS3 ORF sequence from EPgV indicated that EqHV and EPgV have evolved into two main clades by themselves, both of which are circulating in China. Based on the partial NS5B and NS3 ORF sequences of EqHV, the sequences of one clade were also split into two subclades. This study enriches our knowledge of the geographic distribution of these three equine viruses.																					WOS:000376279500056	27182887

Some of the bat transmitted zoonotic viral diseases such as Ebola, Hendra, Nipah and rabies may cause severe human casualties. They also harbor several other viruses such as MERS and SARS corona viruses, which may cause disease in human through direct spillover to human or through an intermediate host or vectors. Being reservoir hosts bats do not get affected by these viruses. This probably may happen due to the specificity of bat immune system, which reacts differently with viral pathogens in comparison to their other mammalian counterparts. Although bats are important reservoir hosts for several zoonotic viruses, very little information is available regarding host/virus relationships as only few experimental studies have been done on bat colonies, lack of expertise for study of bat immunology and antiviral responses and difficulty in conducting field work. However, with the advancement in epidemiology and molecular biology, these problems can be addressed, which will provide the insight into interactions of bats and zoonotic viruses. It may also clarify regarding virus persistence in nature and various associated risk factors which might facilitate viral transmission to animals and humans.

J	Cowled, C.; Wang, L. -F.								Animal genomics in natural reservoirs of infectious diseases								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				35	1			159	174		10.20506/rst.35.1.2425				APR 2016	2016	Natural virus reservoirs such as wild bats, birds, rodents and non-human primates are generally non-model organisms that have, until recently, presented limited opportunities for in-depth study. Next-generation sequencing provides a way to partially circumvent this limitation, since the methods required for data acquisition and analysis are largely species-independent. Comparative genomics and other 'omics' provide new opportunities to study the structure and function of various biological systems of wild species that are otherwise out of reach. Genomes of natural reservoir hosts can help to identify dominant pathways of virus host interaction and to reveal differences between susceptible and resistant organisms, populations and species. This is of great scientific interest and may also provide a resource for the rational design of treatments for viral diseases in humans and livestock. In this way, we will 'learn from nature' and one day apply this knowledge to create disease-resistant livestock or develop novel therapeutic and prevention strategies. Reservoir host genomics will also open up possibilities for developing novel vaccines for wildlife, aid in the development of new diagnostic platforms, and have broad implications for developmental and evolutionary biology. In this review, the authors focus on natural reservoir hosts of viral pathogens, although most of the discussion points should be equally. applicable to natural reservoirs of pathogenic bacteria, fungi or other parasites.

The role of avian species inhabiting sagebrush in the amplification of WNV in arid and semiarid regions of the North America is unknown. We conducted an experimental WNV challenge study in Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), a species common to sagebrush and grassland habitats found throughout much of North America. We found Vesper Sparrows to be moderately susceptible to WNV, developing viremia considered sufficient to transmit WNV to feeding mosquitoes, but the majority of birds were capable of surviving infection and developing a humoral immune response to the WNV nonstructural 1 and envelope proteins. Despite clearance of viremia, after 6 mo, WNV was detected molecularly in three birds and cultured from one bird. Surviving Vesper Sparrows were resistant to reinfection 6 mo after the initial challenge. Vesper sparrows could play a role in the amplification of WNV in sagebrush habitat and other areas of their range, but rapid clearance of WNV may limit their importance as competent amplification hosts of WNV.

In this perspective, three groups of eight rock pigeons (Columbia livia) were inoculated with three WNV lineage 1 strains isolated in Italy between 2009 and 2012. The pigeons did not develop any clinical signs consistent with WNV acute infection. All animals seroconverted and shed virus up to 15 days post-infection by the oral or cloacal routes. In all infected groups viraemia lasted for 4 days post-infection. No WNV-specific gross or histological lesions were found in infected birds compared to control birds and immunohistochemistry remained constantly negative from all tissues. The reservoir competence index was also assessed and it ranged between 011 and 014. This study demonstrates that pigeons are competent reservoir hosts for Italian WNV lineage 1 circulating strains thus potentially posing a risk to the public health system.

Replication and shedding of MERS-CoV in Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis)								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						21878	10.1038/srep21878				FEB 22 2016	2016	The emergence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) highlights the zoonotic potential of Betacoronaviruses. Investigations into the origin of MERS-CoV have focused on two potential reservoirs: bats and camels. Here, we investigated the role of bats as a potential reservoir for MERS-CoV. In vitro, the MERS-CoV spike glycoprotein interacted with Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor and MERS-CoV replicated efficiently in Jamaican fruit bat cells, suggesting there is no restriction at the receptor or cellular level for MERS-CoV. To shed light on the intrinsic host-virus relationship, we inoculated 10 Jamaican fruit bats with MERS-CoV. Although all bats showed evidence of infection, none of the bats showed clinical signs of disease. Virus shedding was detected in the respiratory and intestinal tract for up to 9 days. MERS-CoV replicated transiently in the respiratory and, to a lesser extent, the intestinal tracts and internal organs; with limited histopathological changes observed only in the lungs. Analysis of the innate gene expression in the lungs showed a moderate, transient induction of expression. Our results indicate that MERS-CoV maintains the ability to replicate in bats without clinical signs of disease, supporting the general hypothesis of bats as ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV.

Optimizing Viral Discovery in Bats								PLOS ONE				11	2					e0149237	10.1371/journal.pone.0149237				FEB 11 2016	2016	Viral discovery studies in bats have increased dramatically over the past decade, yet a rigorous synthesis of the published data is lacking. We extract and analyze data from 93 studies published between 2007-2013 to examine factors that increase success of viral discovery in bats, and specific trends and patterns of infection across host taxa and viral families. Over the study period, 248 novel viruses from 24 viral families have been described. Using generalized linear models, at a study level we show the number of host species and viral families tested best explained number of viruses detected. We demonstrate that prevalence varies significantly across viral family, specimen type, and host taxonomy, and calculate mean PCR prevalence by viral family and specimen type across all studies. Using a logistic model, we additionally identify factors most likely to increase viral detection at an individual level for the entire dataset and by viral families with sufficient sample sizes. Our analysis highlights major taxonomic gaps in recent bat viral discovery efforts and identifies ways to improve future viral pathogen detection through the design of more efficient and targeted sample collection and screening approaches.

Chimpanzee Adenovirus Vaccine Provides Multispecies Protection against Rift Valley Fever								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						20617	10.1038/srep20617				FEB 5 2016	2016	Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) causes recurrent outbreaks of acute life-threatening human and livestock illness in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. No licensed vaccines are currently available for humans and those widely used in livestock have major safety concerns. A 'One Health' vaccine development approach, in which the same vaccine is co-developed for multiple susceptible species, is an attractive strategy for RVFV. Here, we utilized a replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine platform with an established human and livestock safety profile, ChAdOx1, to develop a vaccine for use against RVFV in both livestock and humans. We show that single-dose immunization with ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccine, encoding RVFV envelope glycoproteins, elicits high-titre RVFV-neutralizing antibody and provides solid protection against RVFV challenge in the most susceptible natural target species of the virus-sheep, goats and cattle. In addition we demonstrate induction of RVFV-neutralizing antibody by ChAdOx1-GnGc vaccination in dromedary camels, further illustrating the potency of replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine platforms. Thus, ChAdOx1-GnGc warrants evaluation in human clinical trials and could potentially address the unmet human and livestock vaccine needs.																					WOS:000369541300001	26847478

HeV infection of host cells is mediated by the membrane bound attachment (G) and fusion (F) glycoproteins, that are essential for receptor binding and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. The eukaryotic unicellular parasite Leishmania tarentolae has recently been established as a powerful tool to express recombinant proteins with mammalian-like glycosylation patterns, but only few viral proteins have been expressed in this system so far. Here, we describe the purification of a truncated, Strep-tag labelled and soluble version of the HeV attachment protein (sHeV G) expressed in stably transfected L. tarentolae cells. After Streptag purification the identity of sHeV G was confirmed by immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. The functional binding of sHeV G to the HeV cell entry receptor ephrin-B2 was confirmed in several binding assays. Generated polyclonal rabbit antiserum against sHeV G reacted with both HeV and Nipah virus (NiV) G proteins in immunofluorescence assay and efficiently neutralised NiV infection, thus further supporting the preserved antigenicity of the purified protein.

HPgV is prevalent in high-risk groups such as patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and it is of interest for patients who are at risk for transmitted infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPgV as well as the genotype distribution among patients in the Tunisian population who are infected with HCV and also in multitransfused patients. Methods: A total of 144 patients were screened using RTPCR/nested PCR of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR); 14 cases were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Results: Seven (14.9%) subjects from the multitransfused group and 7 (7.2%) patients infected with HCV, respectively, were found positive for HPgV RNA. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the 14 cases revealed that genotype 2a was the main genotype circulating in Tunisian patients. Genotype 2b was found in the amplified samples of 2 HCV-infected patients. Conclusion: This study enriches the limited data on HPgV prevalence in Tunisia, and shows, for the first time, the molecular epidemiology of the circulating strains in this country. (C) 2017 S.

In humans, the infection can be asymptomatic but can also lead to illness, ranging from a mild disease with fever, headache and muscle pain to a severe disease with encephalitis and haemorrhagic fever. In rare cases, death can occur. In infected animals, influenza-like symptoms can occur, and abortion and mortality in young animals are indicative of RVFV infection. Since the initial outbreak in Kenya in the 1930s, the virus has become endemic to most of sub-Saharan Africa. In 2000, the virus appeared in Yemen and Saudi Arabia; this was the first outbreak of RVF outside of Africa. Rift Valley fever epidemics are often connected to heavy rainfall, leading to an increased vector population and spread of the virus to animals and/or humans. However, the virus needs to be maintained during the inter-epidemic periods. In this study, we investigated the circulation of RVFV in small ruminants (goats and sheep) in Zambezia, Mozambique, an area with a close vector/wildlife/livestock/human interface.Materials and methods: Between September and October 2013, 181 sheep and 187 goat blood samples were collected from eight localities in the central region of Zambezia, Mozambique. The samples were analysed for the presence of antibodies against RVFV using a commercial competitive ELISA.Results and discussion: The overall seroprevalence was higher in sheep (44.2%) than goats (25.1%); however, there was a high variation in seroprevalence between different localities. The data indicate an increased seroprevalence for sheep compared to 2010, when a similar study was conducted in this region and in overlapping villages. No noticeable health problems in the herds were reported.Conclusions: This study shows an inter-epidemic circulation of RVFV in small ruminants in Zambezia, Mozambique. Neither outbreaks of RVF nor typical clinical signs of RVFV have been reported in the investigated herds, indicating subclinical infection.																					BCI:BCI201700255960	27388698

Serologic evidence of exposure to Rift Valley fever virus detected in Tunisia								New Microbes and New Infections				9				1	7		10.1016/j.nmni.2015.10.010				JAN 2016	2016	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFv) is capable of causing dramatic outbreaks amongst economically important animal species and is capable of causing severe symptoms and mortality in humans. RVFv is known to circulate widely throughout East Africa; serologic evidence of exposure has also been found in some northern African countries, including Mauritania. This study aimed to ascertain whether RVFv is circulating in regions beyond its known geographic range. Samples from febrile patients (n = 181) and nonfebrile healthy agricultural and slaughterhouse workers (n = 38) were collected during the summer of 2014 and surveyed for exposure to RVFv by both serologic tests and PCR. Of the 219 samples tested, 7.8% of nonfebrile participants showed immunoglobulin G reactivity to RVFv nucleoprotein and 8.3% of febrile patients showed immunoglobulin M reactivity, with the latter samples indicating recent exposure to the virus. Our results suggest an active circulation of RVFv and evidence of human exposure in the population of Tunisia. New Microbes and New Infections (C) 2015 The Authors.

These zoonotic paramyxoviruses are harboured by flying foxes in Australia, the Pacific region and southern and South-east Asia, although there is growing evidence that related henipaviruses infect diverse bat species throughout the world. HeV has caused outbreaks of disease in horses, with horse-to-human transmission in seven cases resulting in four human fatalities. NiV has caused an outbreak of widespread disease in pigs and people in Malaysia and Singapore, and human infections in India and Bangladesh; in the latter countries, zoonotic transmission occurs with nearly annual frequency and human-to-human transmission has been observed. A recent outbreak of disease in horses and people in the Philippines, attributed to henipavirus infection, highlights the ongoing threat to human and livestock health posed by this group of viruses. In this chapter, we discuss the distribution of henipaviruses in bat species in the context of documented human and animal disease outbreaks, as well as the continuing threat of zoonotic spillover. The recent release of an equine HeV vaccine represented a momentous advance in henipavirus infection control, and a promising post-exposure monoclonal antibody has also been developed. Despite these developments, challenges to the control of zoonotic henipavirus transmission, case management of people with persistent central nervous system infection and mitigation of disease outbreaks in resource-poor settings remain, as does the largely undefined threat of the emergence of related, novel viruses from bats.

M.; Ament, Judith M.; Baum, Julia; Clements, Hayley S.; Grewar, John D.; Maciejewski, Kristine; Moore, Christine								Pathogens, disease, and the social-ecological resilience of protected areas								ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY				21	1					20	10.5751/ES-07984-210120				2016	2016	It is extremely important for biodiversity conservation that protected areas are resilient to a range of potential future perturbations. One of the least studied influences on protected area resilience is that of disease. We argue that wildlife disease (1) is a social-ecological problem that must be approached from an interdisciplinary perspective; (2) has the potential to lead to changes in the identity of protected areas, possibly transforming them; and (3) interacts with conservation both directly (via impacts on wild animals, livestock, and people) and indirectly (via the public, conservation management, and veterinary responses). We use southern African protected areas as a case study to test a framework for exploring the connections between conservation, endemic disease, and social-ecological resilience. We first define a set of criteria for the social-ecological identity of protected areas. We then use these criteria to explore the potential impacts of selected diseases (foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, malaria, rabies, rift valley fever, trypanosomiasis, and canine distemper) on protected area resilience. Although endemic diseases may have a number of direct impacts on both wild animals and domestic animals and people, the indirect pathways by which diseases influence social-ecological resilience also emerge as potentially important. The majority of endemic pathogens found in protected areas do not kill large numbers of wild animals or infect many people, and may even play valuable ecological roles; but occasional disease outbreaks and mortalities can have a large impact on public perceptions and disease management, potentially making protected areas unviable in one or more of their stated aims. Neighboring landowners also have a significant impact on park management decisions. The indirect effects triggered by disease in the human social and economic components of protected areas and surrounding landscapes may ultimately have a greater influence on protected area resilience than the direct ecological perturbations caused by disease.

Under natural conditions, HCV is able to infect only humans, and only chimpanzees are sensitive to experimental infection. In recent years, viruses genetically related to HCV were discovered in wild mammals (rodents, bats, rabbits), as well as in domestic animals living in close contact with humans (dogs, horses, cows). The Hepacivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae, previously represented only by HCV and, presumably, by GBV-B, now includes new related viruses of animals. The results of the study of molecular-genetic and biological properties of the hepaciviruses provide an opportunity to understand the history, evolution, and the origin of HCV. It also opens up the prospect of using HCV homologues of non-primates as a laboratory model for preclinical medical and prophylactic drugs against hepatitis C. It was found that the hepacivirus of horses is the most closely related to HCV among currently known HCV homologues.																					BCI:BCI201600733467

These viruses are found on every continent except Antarctica and use a variety of methods for transmission ranging from direct spread between vertebrates, use of haemophilic insects, sexual transmission among insects and even thrips that infect plants. Two non-structural proteins, NSs and NSm, serve as major virulence factors which act to subvert the host anti-viral response by interrupting signalling cascades leading to interferon induction, suppressing transcription of interferon and other host-response genes, inhibiting interferon-stimulated genes, and modulating the regulation of cell death. This chapter will focus on virus-host interactions of the arthropod-borne genera Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus and Nairovirus.																					WOS:000388046300005

In this chapter, we discuss ecological, environmental and anthropological factors that influence the spread, establishment and evolution of vector-borne viruses and the emergence of novel arboviral diseases. These topics include the introduction of viruses and vectors into new geographical regions, the adaption of viruses to new vectors and hosts and how these events influence the evolution of new viral strains, new vector host relationships and the emergence of viral strains with enhanced virulence. The potential effects of climate change, deforestation, and the encroachment of human habitation and agriculture on the emergence and distribution of arboviral diseases are also discussed. We conclude that enhanced arboviral surveillance will be crucial in the management and prevention of vector-borne viral disease in the future, and that new viral detection strategies that are independent of viral sequence or antigenic structure and can be integrated into high-throughput, cost-effective real-time surveillance systems are essential for monitoring the spread of arboviruses and identifying new and emerging vector-borne viruses.

In the past five years, the known phylogenetic diversity of the hepacivirus genera has absolutely exploded. What was once an isolated infection in humans (and possibly other primates) has now expanded to include horses, rodents, bats, colobus monkeys, cows, and, most recently, catsharks, shedding new light on the genetic diversity and host range of hepaciviruses. Interestingly, despite the identification of these many animal and primate hepaciviruses, the equine hepaciviruses remain the closest genetic relatives of the human hepaciviruses, providing an intriguing clue to the zoonotic source of hepatitis C virus. This review summarizes the significance of these studies and discusses current thinking about the origin and evolution of the animal hepaciviruses as well as their potential usage as surrogate models for the study of hepatitis C virus.

Here, I review viruses of all viral families detected in global bat populations. The viral diversity in bats is substantial, and viruses with all known types of genomic structures and replication strategies have been discovered in bats. However, the discovery of viruses is not geographically even, with some apparently undersampled regions, such as South America. Furthermore, some bat families, including those with global or wide distributions such as Emballonuridae and Miniopteridae, are under-represented on viral databases. Future studies, including those that address these sampling gaps along with those that develop our understanding of viral-host relationships, are highlighted.

Co-infection with GBV-C has been reported to confer beneficial outcomes in some HIV-positive patients. Up to now, however, studies on GBV-C infection in the central nervous system (CNS) of HIV-infected patient have rarely been reported. Herein, we report on a 32-year-old HIV-1-infected patient with cerebral toxoplasmosis and fungal encephalitis. GBV-C viral loads were detected in CSF by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR), and the results showed that GBV-C viral load was 6.5 log copies/ml. We amplified and sequenced the E2 and 5'-untranslated regions from the purified viral RNA from CSF by RT-PCR. Both sequences belong to genotype 3 and there were some minor nucleotide divergence among the E2 sequences from the CSF of the patient. These data suggest that GBV-C may be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and colonize the CNS of HIV-infected patients. However, the exact mechanisms and potential effect of the infected GBV-C in CNS on HIV-associated neuropathy needs to be further explored.																					WOS:000366098200013	26081197

As a result, target mRNAs are translationally repressed and subsequently deadenylated and degraded. Curiously, hepatitis C virus (HCV), a member of the Flaviviridae family, recruits two molecules of liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) to the 5' end of its genome. In contrast to the canonical activity of miRNAs, the interactions of miR-122 with the viral genome promote viral RNA accumulation in cultured cells and in animal models of HCV infection. Sequestration of miR-122 results in loss of viral RNA both in cell culture and in the livers of chronic HCV-infected patients. This review discusses the mechanisms by which miR-122 is thought to enhance viral RNA abundance and the consequences of miR-122-HCV interactions. We also describe preliminary findings from phase II clinical trials in patients treated with miR-122 antisense oligonucleotides.																					WOS:000389586100014	27578438

Characterisation of human-associated viral communities is essential for epidemiological surveillance and to be able to anticipate new potential threats for blood transfusion safety. In high-resource countries, the risk of blood-borne agent transmission of well-known viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV) is currently considered to be under control. However, other unknown or unsuspected viruses may be transmitted to recipients by blood-derived products. To investigate this, the virome of plasma from individuals at high risk for parenterally and sexually transmitted infections was analysed by high throughput sequencing (HTS).Materials and methods. Purified nucleic acids from two pools of 50 samples from recipients of multiple transfusions, and three pools containing seven plasma samples from either HBV-, HCV- or HIV-infected blood donors, were submitted to HTS.Results. Sequences from resident anelloviruses and HPgV were evidenced in all pools. HBV and HCV sequences were detected in pools containing 3.8x10(3) IU/mL of HBV-DNA and 1.7x10(5) IU/mL of HCV-RNA, respectively, whereas no HIV sequence was found in a pool of 150 copies/mL of HIV-RNA. This suggests a lack of sensitivity in HTS performance in detecting low levels of virus. In addition, this study identified other issues, including laboratory contaminants and the uncertainty of taxonomic assignment of short sequence. No sequence suggestive of a new viral species was identified.Discussion. This study did not identify any new blood-borne virus in high-risk individuals. However, rare and/or viruses present at very low titre could have escaped our protocol. Our results demonstrate the positive contribution of HTS in the detection of viral sequences in blood donations.																					WOS:000385371200003	27136432

To better understand their diversity, evolutionary history, and genomic flexibility, we used transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) to search for the viruses related to the Flaviviridae in a range of potential invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Accordingly, we recovered the full genomes of five segmented jingmenviruses and 12 distant relatives of the known Flaviviridae ("flavilike" viruses) from a range of arthropod species. Although these viruses are highly divergent, they share a similar genomic plan and common ancestry with the Flaviviridae in the NS3 and NS5 regions. Remarkably, although these viruses fill in major gaps in the phylogenetic diversity of the Flaviviridae, genomic comparisons reveal important changes in genome structure, genome size, and replication/gene regulation strategy during evolutionary history. In addition, the wide diversity of flavi-like viruses found in invertebrates, as well as their deep phylogenetic positions, suggests that they may represent the ancestral forms from which the vertebrate-infecting viruses evolved. For the vertebrate viruses, we expanded the previously mammal-only pegivirus-hepacivirus group to include a virus from the graceful catshark (Proscyllium habereri), which in turn implies that these viruses possess a larger host range than is currently known. In sum, our data show that the Flaviviridae infect a far wider range of hosts and exhibit greater diversity in genome structure than previously anticipated.IMPORTANCEThe family Flaviviridae of RNA viruses contains several notorious human pathogens, including dengue virus, West Nile virus, and hepatitis C virus. To date, however, our understanding of the biodiversity and evolution of the Flaviviridae has largely been directed toward vertebrate hosts and their blood-feeding arthropod vectors. Therefore, we investigated an expanded group of potential arthropod and vertebrate host species that have generally been ignored by surveillance programs. Remarkably, these species contained diverse flaviviruses and related viruses that are characterized by major changes in genome size and genome structure, such that these traits are more flexible than previously thought. More generally, these data suggest that arthropods may be the ultimate reservoir of the Flaviviridae and related viruses, harboring considerable genetic and phenotypic diversity. In sum, this study revises the traditional view on the evolutionary history, host range, and genomic structures of a major group of RNA viruses.																					WOS:000367527900005	26491167

Herein, we have reviewed six viral families that constitute the majority of arboviruses transmissible to humans and livestock including: alphaviruses (Togaviridae), flaviviruses (Flaviviridae), rhabdoviruses (Rhabdoviridae), bunyaviruses (Bunyaviridae), reoviruses (Reoviridae) and orthomyxoviruses (Orthomyxoviridae). Descriptions of the overall genomic architecture, viral proteins and replicative strategies have been included and serve to compare and contrast the breadth of variation that can be observed among these diverse groups of viruses that are transmitted by arthropod vectors. This diversity indicates the likelihood of convergence of disparate viral groups for arthropod transmission yet such a comparison can serve to highlight conserved genetic strategies between dipartite viruses for elucidation of the evolutionary pressures imposed by the necessity for replication in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.

However, analytical methods to support NGS platforms are not as uniformly available. Pathosphere (found at Pathosphere.org) is a cloud based open sourced community tool that allows for communication, collaboration and sharing of NGS analytical tools and data amongst scientists working in academia, industry and government. The architecture allows for users to upload data and run available bioinformatics pipelines without the need for onsite processing hardware or technical support.Results: The pathogen detection capabilities hosted on Pathosphere were tested by analyzing pathogen-containing samples sequenced by NGS with both spiked human samples as well as human and zoonotic host backgrounds. Pathosphere analytical pipelines developed by Edgewood Chemical Biological Center (ECBC) identified spiked pathogens within a common sample analyzed by 454, Ion Torrent, and Illumina sequencing platforms. ECBC pipelines also correctly identified pathogens in human samples containing arenavirus in addition to animal samples containing flavivirus and coronavirus. These analytical methods were limited in the detection of sequences with limited homology to previous annotations within NCBI databases, such as parvovirus. Utilizing the pipeline-hosting adaptability of Pathosphere, the analytical suite was supplemented by analytical pipelines designed by the United States Army Medical Research Insititute of Infectious Diseases and Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (USAMRIID-WRAIR). These pipelines were implemented and detected parvovirus sequence in the sample that the ECBC iterative analysis previously failed to identify.Conclusions: By accurately detecting pathogens in a variety of samples, this work demonstrates the utility of Pathosphere and provides a platform for utilizing, modifying and creating pipelines for a variety of NGS technologies developed to detect pathogens in complex sample backgrounds. These results serve as an exhibition for the existing pipelines and web-based interface of Pathosphere as well as the plug-in adaptability that allows for integration of newer NGS analytical software as it becomes available.

In the present study, we identified ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) contributed to the inhibitory effect of GBV-C E2 on HIV-1 Gag membrane targeting. Expression of GBV-C E2 decreased ARF1 expression in a proteasomal degradation-dependent manner. The restoration of ARF1 expression rescued the HIV-1 Gag processing and membrane targeting defect imposed by GBV-C E2. In addition, GBV-C E2 expression also altered Golgi morphology and suppressed protein traffic through the secretory pathway, which are all consistent with a phenotype of disrupting the function of ARF1 protein. Thus, our results indicate that GBV-C E2 inhibits HIV-1 assembly and release by decreasing ARF1, and may provide insights regarding GBV-C E2's potential for a new therapeutic approach for treating HIV-1.

Common infectious causes of diarrhoea in lambs and kids during the first month of life are of bacterial or parasite nature. However, despite appreciable improvements in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies over the last decades, diarrhoea is still a common and costly syndrome affecting newborn small ruminants. Recent advances in the diagnostics and metagenomic investigations of the enteric environment have allowed discovering a number of novel viruses, although their pathobiological properties remain largely unknown. Assessing more in depth the impact of these viruses on the health and productions of these livestock animals is necessary and requires the development of accurate diagnostic tools and updating of the diagnostic algorithms of enteric pathological conditions.

Respiratory nanoparticle-based vaccines and challenges associated with animal models and translation								JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE				219				622	631		10.1016/j.jconrel.2015.09.047				DEC 10 2015	2015	Vaccine development has had a huge impact on human health. However, there is a significant need to develop efficacious vaccines for several existing as well as emerging respiratory infectious diseases. Several challenges need to be overcome to develop efficacious vaccines with translational potential. This review focuses on two aspects to overcome some barriers - 1) the development of nanoparticle-based vaccines, and 2) the choice of suitable animal models for respiratory infectious diseases thatwill allow for translation. Nanoparticle-based vaccines, including subunit vaccines involving synthetic and/or natural polymeric adjuvants and carriers, as well as those based on virus-like particles offer several key advantages to help overcome the barriers to effective vaccine development. These include the ability to deliver combinations of antigens, target the vaccine formulation to specific immune cells, enable cross-protection against divergent strains, act as adjuvants or immunomodulators, allow for sustained release of antigen, enable single dose delivery, and potentially obviate the cold chain. While mouse models have provided several important insights into the mechanisms of infectious diseases, they are often a limiting step in translation of new vaccines to the clinic. An overview of different animal models involved in vaccine research for respiratory infections, with advantages and disadvantages of each model, is discussed. Taken together, advances in nanotechnology, combined with the right animal models for evaluating vaccine efficacy, has the potential to revolutionize vaccine development for respiratory infections.

To our knowledge, no previous study was conducted about HPgV in Qatar. Thus, the objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to determine the rates of HPgV infection in Qatar among healthy blood donors and HBV-infected patients, and (ii) to determine the most predominant HPgV genotype in Qatar. A total of 714 blood plasma samples from healthy donors (612) and HBV-infected patients (102) were collected. RNA was extracted, reversed transcribed, and then subjected for HPgV detection by two round-nested PCR using primers amplifying a 208 bp of 5-UTR of the HPgV. For genotyping, the 5-UTR PCR products (from 25 randomly picked samples) were cloned and sequenced. The overall infection rate of HPgV in Qatar was 13.3%. There was no significant difference (P=0.41) in the infection rates between healthy donor (13.7%) and in HBV-infected patients (10.7%). Moreover, we did not find any significant association between HPgV infection rates and nationality, sex, or age (P>0.05). Sequence analysis of 40 5-UTR PCR amplicons yielded the European genotype 2 as most predominant in Qatar, although other genotypes (5 and7) were also present. Our results indicate that there is no strong correlation between HPgV infection rate, condition, nationality, age, and sex, and genotype 2 is most predominant in Qatar. J. Med.

We present the discovery of a second pegivirus, provisionally designated human pegivirus 2 (HPgV-2), by next-generation sequencing of plasma from an HCV-infected patient with multiple bloodborne exposures who died from sepsis of unknown etiology. HPgV-2 is highly divergent, situated on a deep phylogenetic branch in a clade that includes rodent and bat pegiviruses, with which it shares < 32% amino acid identity. Molecular and serological tools were developed and validated for high-throughput screening of plasma samples, and a panel of 3 independent serological markers strongly correlated antibody responses with viral RNA positivity (99.9% negative predictive value). Discovery of 11 additional RNA-positive samples from a total of 2440 screened (0.45%) revealed 93-94% nucleotide identity between HPgV-2 strains. All 12 HPgV-2 RNA-positive cases were identified in individuals also testing positive for HCV RNA (12 of 983; 1.22%), including 2 samples co-infected with HIV, but HPgV-2 RNA was not detected in non-HCV-infected individuals (p < 0.0001), including those singly infected by HIV (p = 0.0075) or HBV (p = 0.0077), nor in volunteer blood donors (p = 0.0082). Nine of the 12 (75%) HPgV-2 RNA positive samples were reactive for antibodies to viral serologic markers, whereas only 28 of 2,429 (1.15%) HPgV-2 RNA negative samples were seropositive. Longitudinal sampling in two individuals revealed that active HPgV-2 infection can persist in blood for at least 7 weeks, despite the presence of virus-specific antibodies. One individual harboring both HPgV-2 and HCV RNA was found to be seronegative for both viruses, suggesting a high likelihood of simultaneous acquisition of HCV and HPgV-2 infection from an acute co-transmission event. Taken together, our results indicate that HPgV-2 is a novel bloodborne infectious virus of humans and likely transmitted via the parenteral route.																					WOS:000368332800043	26658760

Citizen Science and Wildlife Disease Surveillance								ECOHEALTH				12	4			693	702		10.1007/s10393-015-1054-z				DEC 2015	2015	Achieving effective wildlife disease surveillance is challenging. The incorporation of citizen science (CS) in wildlife health surveillance can be beneficial, particularly where resources are limited and cost-effectiveness is paramount. Reports of wildlife morbidity and mortality from the public facilitate large-scale surveillance, both in time and space, which would otherwise be financially infeasible, and raise awareness of incidents occurring on privately owned land. CS wildlife disease surveillance schemes benefit scientists, the participating public and wildlife alike. CS has been employed for targeted, scanning and syndromic surveillance of wildlife disease. Whilst opportunistic surveillance is most common, systematic observations enable the standardisation of observer effort and, combined with wildlife population monitoring schemes, can allow evaluation of disease impacts at the population level. Near-universal access to digital media has revolutionised reporting modalities and facilitated rapid and economical means of sharing feedback with participants. Here we review CS schemes for wildlife disease surveillance and highlight their scope, benefits, logistical considerations, financial implications and potential limitations. The need to adopt a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to wildlife health surveillance is increasingly recognised and the general public can make a significant contribution through CS.

Recently, two novel, presumably hepatotropic, pegiviruses, designated as equine Pegivirus (EPgV) and Theiler's Disease Associated Virus (TDAV), were discovered in horses with clinical and laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. To verify the occurrence of pegiviruses infection in horses from Para State, northern Brazil, serum samples from 114 horses located in four cities (Acaras, Belem, Dom Eliseu and Ananindeua) were submitted for the molecular analysis of EPgV by nested RT-PCR. The results of nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of EPgV NS3 and NS5B genomic regions confirmed one positive sample among 114 tested samples (1/114; 0.8%). No evidence of TDAV infection was found, but despite the low prevalence and unknown clinical significance among the studied population, these results represent the first molecular detection of EPgV in horses in South America.

J	Klemens, O.; Dubrau, D.; Tautz, N.								Characterization of the Determinants of NS2-3-Independent Virion Morphogenesis of Pestiviruses								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	22			11668	11680		10.1128/JVI.01646-15				NOV 2015	2015	A peculiarity of the Flaviviridae is the critical function of nonstructural (NS) proteins for virus particle formation. For pestiviruses, like bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), uncleaved NS2-3 represents an essential factor for virion morphogenesis, while NS3 is an essential component of the viral replicase. Accordingly, in natural pestivirus isolates, processing at the NS2-3 cleavage site is not complete, to allow for virion morphogenesis. Virion morphogenesis of the related hepatitis C virus (HCV) shows a major deviation from that of pestiviruses: while RNA replication also requires free NS3, virion formation does not depend on uncleaved NS2-NS3. Recently, we described a BVDV-1 chimera based on strain NCP7 encompassing the NS2-4B*-coding region of strain Osloss (E. Lattwein, O. Klemens, S. Schwindt, P. Becher, and N. Tautz, J Virol 86:427-437, 2012, doi:10.1128/JVI.06133-11). This chimera allowed for the production of infectious virus particles in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3. The Osloss sequence deviates in the NS2-4B* part from NCP7 in 48 amino acids and also has a ubiquitin insertion between NS2 and NS3. The present study demonstrates that in the NCP7 backbone, only two amino acid exchanges in NS2 (E1576V) and NS3 (V1721A) are sufficient and necessary to allow for efficient NS2-3-independent virion morphogenesis. The adaptation of a bicistronic virus encompassing an internal ribosomal entry site element between the NS2 and NS3 coding sequences to efficient virion morphogenesis led to the identification of additional amino acids in E2, NS2, and NS5B that are critically involved in this process. The surprisingly small requirements for approximating the packaging schemes of pestiviruses and HCV with respect to the NS2-3 region is in favor of a common mechanism in an ancestral virus.IMPORTANCEFor positive-strand RNA viruses, the processing products of the viral polyprotein serve in RNA replication as well as virion morphogenesis. For bovine viral diarrhea virus, nonstructural protein NS2-3 is of critical importance to switch between these processes. While free NS3 is essential for RNA replication, uncleaved NS2-3, which accumulates over time in the infected cell, is required for virion morphogenesis. In contrast, the virion morphogenesis of the related hepatitis C virus is independent from uncleaved NS2-NS3. Here, we demonstrate that pestiviruses can adapt to virion morphogenesis in the absence of uncleaved NS2-3 by just two amino acid exchanges. While the mechanism behind this gain of function remains elusive, the fact that it can be achieved by such minor changes is in line with the assumption that an ancestral virus already used this mechanism but lost it in the course of adapting to a new host/infection strategy.

Evolutionary and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Hepaciviruses and Pegiviruses								GENOME BIOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				7	11			2996	3008		10.1093/gbe/evv202				NOV 2015	2015	The known genetic diversity of the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses has increased greatly in recent years through the discovery of viruses related to hepatitis C virus and human pegivirus in bats, bovines, equines, primates, and rodents. Analysis of these new species is important for research into animal models of hepatitis C virus infection and into the zoonotic origins of human viruses. Here, we provide the first systematic phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of these two genera at the whole-genome level. Phylogenies confirmed that hepatitis C virus is most closely related to viruses from horses whereas human pegiviruses clustered with viruses from African primates. Within each genus, several well-supported lineages were identified and viral diversity was structured by both host species and location of sampling. Recombination analyses provided evidence of interspecific recombination in hepaciviruses, but none in the pegiviruses. Putative mosaic genome structures were identified in NS5B gene region and were supported by multiple tests. The identification of interspecific recombination in the hepaciviruses represents an important evolutionary event that could be clarified by future sampling of novel viruses. We also identified parallel amino acid changes shared by distantly related lineages that infect similar types of host. Notable parallel changes were clustered in the NS3 and NS4B genes and provide a useful starting point for experimental studies of the evolution of Hepacivirus host-virus interactions.

The presence of NPHV in dogs outside of the USA however is yet to be established. Here we describe for the first time the detection of NPHV in the UK dog population (described throughout the manuscript as CnNPHV). We examined tissues collected from dogs housed in a rehoming kennel where respiratory disease was endemic CnNPHV RNA was detected in the tracheal tissues of 48/210 dogs by RT-PCR, and in the liver, lung and/or tracheal tissues of 12/20 dogs. The presence of CriNPHV RNA, and its tropism was confirmed by in situ hybridisation. Histopathological examination demonstrated a trend toward higher histopathological scores in CnNPHV RNA positive respiratory tissues, although, this was not statistically significant Our findings broaden the geographic distribution and our understanding of CnNPHV. Further evidence of CnNPHV replication in canids warrants investigation. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc.																					WOS:000361578100011	26086431

Further Assessment of Monkeypox Virus Infection in Gambian Pouched Rats (Cricetomys gambianus) Using In Vivo Bioluminescent Imaging								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				9	10					e0004130	10.1371/journal.pntd.0004130				OCT 2015	2015	Monkeypox is a zoonosis clinically similar to smallpox in humans. Recent evidence has shown a potential risk of increased incidence in central Africa. Despite attempts to isolate the virus from wild rodents and other small mammals, no reservoir host has been identified. In 2003, Monkeypox virus (MPXV) was accidentally introduced into the U.S. via the pet trade and was associated with the Gambian pouched rat (Cricetomys gambianus). Therefore, we investigated the potential reservoir competence of the Gambian pouched rat for MPXV by utilizing a combination of in vivo and in vitro methods. We inoculated three animals by the intradermal route and three animals by the intranasal route, with one mock-infected control for each route. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was used to track replicating virus in infected animals and virological assays (e.g. real time PCR, cell culture) were used to determine viral load in blood, urine, ocular, nasal, oral, and rectal swabs. Intradermal inoculation resulted in clinical signs of monkeypox infection in two of three animals. One severely ill animal was euthanized and the other affected animal recovered. In contrast, intranasal inoculation resulted in subclinical infection in all three animals. All animals, regardless of apparent or inapparent infection, shed virus in oral and nasal secretions. Additionally, BLI identified viral replication in the skin without grossly visible lesions. These results suggest that Gambian pouched rats may play an important role in transmission of the virus to humans, as they are hunted for consumption and it is possible for MPXV-infected pouched rats to shed infectious virus without displaying overt clinical signs.

To investigate potential changes in the oligomerization of virion-associated envelope proteins, we performed SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions but without thermal denaturation. This revealed the presence of SDS-resistant trimers of E1 in the context of cell-cultured HCV(HCVcc) as well as in the context of HCV pseudo particles (HCVpp). The formation of E1 trimers was found to depend on the coexpression of E2. To further understand the origin of E1 trimer formation, we coexpressed in bacteria the transmembrane (TM) domains of E1 (TME1) and E2 (TME2) fused to reporter proteins and analyzed the fusion proteins by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. As expected for strongly interacting TM domains, TME1-TME2 heterodimers resistant to SDS were observed. These analyses also revealed homodimers and homotrimers of TME1, indicating that such complexes are stable species. The N-terminal segment of TME1 exhibits a highly conserved GxxxG sequence, a motif that is well documented to be involved in intramembrane protein-protein interactions. Single or double mutations of the glycine residues (Gly354 and Gly358) in this motif markedly decreased or abrogated the formation of TME1 homotrimers in bacteria, as well as homotrimers of E1 in both HCVpp and HCVcc systems. A concomitant loss of infectivity was observed, indicating that the trimeric form of E1 is essential for virus infectivity. Taken together, these results indicate that E1E2 heterodimers form trimers on HCV particles, and they support the hypothesis that E1 could be a fusion protein.IMPORTANCEHCV glycoproteins E1 and E2 play an essential role in virus entry into liver cells as well as in virion morphogenesis. In infected cells, these two proteins form a complex in which E2 interacts with cellular receptors, whereas the function of E1 remains poorly understood. However, recent structural data suggest that E1 could be the protein responsible for the process of fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Here we investigated the oligomeric state of HCV envelope glycoproteins. We demonstrate that E1 forms functional trimers after virion assembly and that in addition to the requirement for E2, a determinant for this oligomerization is present in a conserved GxxxG motif located within the E1 transmembrane domain. Taken together, these results indicate that a rearrangement of E1E2 heterodimer complexes likely occurs during the assembly of HCV particles to yield a trimeric form of the E1E2 heterodimer. Gaining structural information on this trimer will be helpful for the design of an anti-HCV vaccine.																					WOS:000363464700016	26246575

Laboratory Investigations of African Pouched Rats (Cricetomys gambianus) as a Potential Reservoir Host Species for Monkeypox Virus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				9	10					e0004013	10.1371/journal.pntd.0004013				OCT 2015	2015	Monkeypox is a zoonotic disease endemic to central and western Africa, where it is a major public health concern. Although Monkeypox virus (MPXV) and monkeypox disease in humans have been well characterized, little is known about its natural history, or its maintenance in animal populations of sylvatic reservoir(s). In 2003, several species of rodents imported from Ghana were involved in a monkeypox outbreak in the United States with individuals of three African rodent genera (Cricetomys, Graphiurus, Funisciurus) shown to be infected with MPXV. Here, we examine the course of MPXV infection in Cricetomys gambianus (pouched Gambian rats) and this rodent species' competence as a host for the virus. We obtained ten Gambian rats from an introduced colony in Grassy Key, Florida and infected eight of these via scarification with a challenge dose of 4X10(4) plaque forming units (pfu) from either of the two primary clades of MPXV: Congo Basin (C-MPXV: n = 4) or West African (W-MPXV: n = 4); an additional 2 animals served as PBS controls. Viral shedding and the effect of infection on activity and physiological aspects of the animals were measured. MPXV challenged animals had significantly higher core body temperatures, reduced activity and increased weight loss than PBS controls. Viable virus was found in samples taken from animals in both experimental groups (C-MPXV and W-MPXV) between 3 and 27 days post infection (p.i.) (up to 1X10(8) pfu/ml), with viral DNA found until day 56 p.i. The results from this work show that Cricetomys gambianus (and by inference, probably the closely related species, Cricetomys emini) can be infected with MPXV and shed viable virus particles; thus suggesting that these animals may be involved in the maintenance of MPXV in wildlife mammalian populations. More research is needed to elucidate the epidemiology of MPXV and the role of Gambian rats and other species.																					WOS:000364459600007	26517724

Durable sequence stability and bone marrow tropism in a macaque model of human pegivirus infection								SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				7	305					305ra144	10.1126/scitranslmed.aab3467				SEP 16 2015	2015	Human pegivirus (HPgV)-formerly known as GB virus C and hepatitis G virus-is a poorly characterized RNA virus that infects about one-sixth of the global human population and is transmitted frequently in the blood supply. We create an animal model of HPgV infection by infecting macaque monkeys with a new simian pegivirus (SPgV) discovered in wild baboons. Using this model, we provide a high-resolution, longitudinal picture of SPgV viremia where the dose, route, and timing of infection are known. We detail the highly variable acute phase of SPgV infection, showing that the viral load trajectory early in infection is dependent on the infecting dose, whereas the chronic-phase viremic set point is not. We also show that SPgV has an extremely low propensity for accumulating sequence variation, with no consensus-level variants detected during the acute phase of infection and an average of only 1.5 variants generated per 100 infection-days. Finally, we show that SPgV RNA is highly concentrated in only two tissues: spleen and bone marrow, with bone marrow likely producing most of the virus detected in plasma. Together, these results reconcile several paradoxical observations from cross-sectional analyses of HPgV in humans and provide an animal model for studying pegivirus biology.

Ian								Virome Analysis of Transfusion Recipients Reveals a Novel Human Virus That Shares Genomic Features with Hepaciviruses and Pegiviruses								MBIO				6	5					e01466-15	10.1128/mBio.01466-15				SEP-OCT 2015	2015	To investigate the transmission of novel infectious agents by blood transfusion, we studied changes in the virome composition of blood transfusion recipients pre- and posttransfusion. Using this approach, we detected and genetically characterized a novel human virus, human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1), that shares features with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly called GB virus C or hepatitis G virus). HCV and HPgV belong to the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus of the family Flaviviridae. HHpgV-1 was found in serum samples from two blood transfusion recipients and two hemophilia patients who had received plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates. In the former, the virus was detected only in the posttransfusion samples, indicating blood-borne transmission. Both hemophiliacs were persistently viremic over periods of at least 201 and 1,981 days. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of HHpgV-1 contained a type IV internal ribosome entry site (IRES), structurally similar to although highly divergent in sequence from that of HCV and other hepaciviruses. However, phylogenetic analysis of nonstructural genes (NS3 and NS5B) showed that HHpgV-1 forms a branch within the pegivirus clade distinct from HPgV and homologs infecting other mammalian species. In common with some pegivirus variants infecting rodents and bats, the HHpgV-1 genome encodes a short, highly basic protein upstream of E1, potentially possessing a core-like function in packaging RNA during assembly. Identification of this new human virus, HHpgV-1, expands our knowledge of the range of genome configurations of these viruses and may lead to a reevaluation of the original criteria by which the genera Hepacivirus and Pegivirus are defined.IMPORTANCE More than 30 million blood components are transfused annually in the United States alone. Surveillance for infectious agents in the blood supply is key to ensuring the safety of this critical resource for medicine and public health. Here, we report the identification of a new and highly diverse HCV/GB virus (GBV)-like virus from human serum samples. This new virus, human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1), was found in serum samples from blood transfusion recipients, indicating its potential for transmission via transfusion products. We also found persistent long-term HHpgV-1 viremia in two hemophilia patients. HHpgV-1 is unique because it shares genetic similarity with both highly pathogenic HCV and the apparently nonpathogenic HPgV (GBV-C). Our results add to the list of human viruses and provide data to develop reagents to study virus transmission and disease association and for interrupting virus transmission and new human infections.

While HeV is confined to Australia, more recent NiV outbreaks have been reported in Bangladesh, India and the Philippines. The clinical manifestations of both henipaviruses in humans appear similar, with a predominance of an acute encephalitic syndrome. Likewise, the pathological features are similar and characterized by disseminated, multi-organ vasculopathy comprising endothelial infection/ulceration, vasculitis, vasculitis-induced thrombosis/occlusion, parenchymal ischemia/microinfarction, and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system (CNS), lung, kidney and other major organs. This unique dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculitis-induced microinfarction and neuronal infection causes severe tissue damage in the CNS. Both viruses can also cause relapsing encephalitis months and years after the acute infection. Many animal models studied to date have largely confirmed the pathology of henipavirus infection, and provided the means to test new therapeutic agents and vaccines. As the bat is the natural host of henipaviruses and has worldwide distribution, spillover events into human populations are expected to occur in the future.

The 3' and 5' terminal regions contain short conserved sequences that are proposed to be repeated remnants of an ancient sequence. However, the functions of most of these conserved sequences have not yet been determined. The terminal regions of the genome also contain multiple conserved RNA structures. Functional data for many of these structures have been obtained. Three sets of complementary 3' and 5' terminal region sequences, some of which are located in conserved RNA structures, interact to form a panhandle structure that is required for initiation of minus strand RNA synthesis with the 5' terminal structure functioning as the promoter. How the switch from the terminal RNA structure base pairing to the long distance RNA-RNA interaction is triggered and regulated is not well understood but evidence suggests involvement of a cell protein binding to three sites on the 3' terminal RNA structures and a cis-acting metastable 3' RNA element in the 3' terminal RNA structure. Cell proteins may also be involved in facilitating exponential replication of nascent genomic RNA within replication vesicles at later times of the infection cycle. Other conserved RNA structures and/or sequences in the 3' and 5' terminal regions have been proposed to regulate genome translation. Additional functions of the 3' and 5' terminal sequences have also been reported. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000357438700013	25683510

In this review we summarize published data from studies with WNV,YFV,DENV, JEV, and MVEV on sfRNA production following incomplete degradation of the viral genomic RNA by the cellular 5'-3' exoribonuclease 1 (XRN1), RNA structural elements involved in stalling XRN1 to generate sfRNA, and functions of sfRNA in modulating cellular mRNA decay and RNAi pathways as well as in modulating anti-viral type I interferon response. In addition, we also summarize data on the mechanisms of biogenesis of 3'UTR-derived KUN-miR-1 and its function in WNV replication in mosquito host, along with recent findings on a discovery of a second potential flaviviral miRNA vsRNA5, derived from the 3'UTR of DENV.

The absence of effective drugs treatment makes imperative the quest for efficient antivirals. Using a plaque inhibition assay we studied the antiviral action of the non-cytotoxic flavanones naringenin, hesperetin, and their glycoside forms on the replication of the 17D strain of yellow fever virus (YFV17D). Using plaque assay the glycosylated forms did not show antiviral effect at the highest concentration used, naringenin and hesperetin reduced the plaque size and the infectious titer up to 85.51% and 100% respectively at the maximum concentration employed. The effective dose (ED50) of naringenin (0.0013 mu M), calculated by plaque assay, was approximately tenfold lower than hesperetin (ED50 0.01 mu M), and neither showed any virucidal effect. Evaluation of kinetic entrance of YFV to cell showed that after 2h of infection 80% of the virus was already into the cell, but in the presence of naringenin or hesperetin, this entrance were inhibited to 48.58% and 55.2% respectively (p <= 0.05). Study of molecular parameters of naringenin and hesperetin demonstrated that naringenin Log P = -1.56 is ten times higher than hesperetin (Log P = -2.56), and therefore less hydrophilic and probably more effective in passing through membranes, which could be related to its ability to interfere with the viral replication beside the entrance level																					WOS:000363898100005		
J	Kapusinszky, Beatrix; Mulvaney, Usha; Jasinska, Anna J.; Deng, Xutao; Freimer, Nelson; Delwart, Eric								Local Virus Extinctions following a Host Population Bottleneck								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	16			8152	8161		10.1128/JVI.00671-15				AUG 2015	2015	A small number of African green monkeys (AGMs) were introduced into the Caribbean from West Africa in the 1600s. To determine the impact of this population bottleneck on the AGM virome, we used metagenomics to compare the viral nucleic acids in the plasma of 43 wild AGMs from West Africa (Gambia) to those in 44 AGMs from the Caribbean (St. Kitts and Nevis). Three viruses were detected in the blood of Gambian primates: simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm; in 42% of animals), a novel simian pegivirus (SPgVagm; in 7% of animals), and numerous novel simian anelloviruses (in 100% of animals). Only anelloviruses were detected in the Caribbean AGMs with a prevalence and levels of viral genetic diversity similar to those in the Gambian animals. A host population bottleneck therefore resulted in the exclusion of adult-acquired SIV and pegivirus from the Caribbean AGMs. The successful importation of AGM anelloviruses into the Caribbean may be the result of their early transmission to infants, very high prevalence in African AGMs, and frequent coinfections with as many as 11 distinct variants.IMPORTANCEThe extent to which viruses can persist in small isolated populations depends on multiple host, viral, and environmental factors. The absence of prior infections may put an immunologically naive population at risk for disease outbreaks. Isolated populations originating from a small number of founder individuals are therefore considered at increased risk following contact with populations with a greater variety of viruses. Here, we compared the plasma virome of West African green monkeys to that in their descendants after importation of a small number of animals to the Caribbean. A lentivirus and a pegivirus were found in the West African population but not in the Caribbean population. Highly diverse anelloviruses were found in both populations. A small founder population, limited to infants and young juvenile monkeys, may have eliminated the sexually transmitted viruses from the Caribbean AGMs, while anelloviruses, acquired at an earlier age, persisted through the host population bottleneck.

J	Paweska, J. T.								Rift Valley fever								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				34	2			375	389		10.20506/rst.34.2.2364				AUG 2015	2015	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic viral disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants, camels and humans. The causative agent of RVF, the RVF virus (RVFV), has the capacity to cause large and severe outbreaks in animal and human populations and to cross significant natural geographic barriers. Rift Valley fever is usually inapparent in non-pregnant adult animals, but pregnant animals and newborns can be severely affected; outbreaks are characterised by a sudden onset of abortions and high neonatal mortality. The majority of human infections are subclinical or associated with moderate to severe, non-fatal, febrile illness, but some patients may develop a haemorrhagic syndrome and/or ocular and neurological lesions. In both animals and humans, the primary site of RVFV replication and tissue pathology is the liver. Outbreaks of RVF are associated with persistent high rainfalls leading to massive flooding and the emergence of large numbers of competent mosquito vectors that transmit the virus to a wide range of susceptible vertebrate species. Outbreaks of RVF have devastating economic effects on countries for which animal trade constitutes the main source of national revenue. The propensity of the virus to spread into new territories and re-emerge in traditionally endemic regions, where it causes large outbreaks in human and animal populations, presents a formidable challenge for public and veterinary health authorities. The presence of competent mosquito vectors in RVF-free countries, the wide range of mammals susceptible to the virus, altering land use, the global changes in climate, and increased animal trade and travel are some of the factors which might contribute to international spread of RVF.

J	Vercauteren, Koen; de Jong, Ype P.; Meuleman, Philip								Animal models for the study of HCV								CURRENT OPINION IN VIROLOGY				13				67	74		10.1016/j.coviro.2015.04.009				AUG 2015	2015	The development and evaluation of effective therapies and vaccines for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the study of its interactions with the mammalian host have been hindered for a long time by the absence of suitable small animal models. Immune compromised mouse models that recapitulate the complete HCV life cycle have been useful to investigate many aspects of the HCV life cycle including antiviral interventions. However, HCV has a high propensity to establish persistence and associated histopathological manifestations such as steatosis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Better understanding of these processes requires the development of a permissive and fully immunocompetent small animal model. In this review we summarize the in vivo models that are available for the study of HCV.																					WOS:000361074300013	26304554

Susceptibility of Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) to Monkeypox Virus: A Low Dose Prospective Model for Monkeypox and Smallpox Disease								PLOS ONE				10	7					e0131742	10.1371/journal.pone.0131742				JUL 6 2015	2015	Although current nonhuman primate models of monkeypox and smallpox diseases provide some insight into disease pathogenesis, they require a high titer inoculum, use an unnatural route of infection, and/or do not accurately represent the entire disease course. This is a concern when developing smallpox and/or monkeypox countermeasures or trying to understand host pathogen relationships. In our studies, we altered half of the test system by using a New World nonhuman primate host, the common marmoset. Based on dose finding studies, we found that marmosets are susceptible to monkeypox virus infection, produce a high viremia, and have pathological features consistent with smallpox and monkeypox in humans. The low dose (48 plaque forming units) required to elicit a uniformly lethal disease and the extended incubation (preclinical signs) are unique features among nonhuman primate models utilizing monkeypox virus. The uniform lethality, hemorrhagic rash, high viremia, decrease in platelets, pathology, and abbreviated acute phase are reflective of early-type hemorrhagic smallpox.

In recent years, HCV-related sequences have been found in bats, rodents, horses, and dogs, indicating a widespread distribution of hepaciviruses among animals. By applying unbiased high-throughput sequencing, a novel virus of the genus Hepacivirus was discovered in a bovine serum sample. De novo assembly yielded a nearly full-length genome coding for a polyprotein of 2,779 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the virus represents a novel species within the genus Hepacivirus. Viral RNA screening determined that 1.6% (n = 5) of 320 individual animals and 3.2% (n = 5) of 158 investigated cattle herds in Germany were positive for bovine hepacivirus. Repeated reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analyses of animals from one dairy herd proved that a substantial percentage of cows were infected, with some of them being viremic for over 6 months. Clinical and postmortem examination revealed no signs of disease, including liver damage. Interestingly, quantitative RT-PCR from different organs and tissues, together with the presence of an miR-122 binding site in the viral genome, strongly suggests a liver tropism for bovine hepacivirus, making this novel virus a promising animal model for HCV infections in humans.IMPORTANCELivestock animals act as important sources for emerging pathogens. In particular, their large herd size and the existence of multiple ways of direct and food-borne infection routes emphasize their role as virus reservoirs. Apart from the search for novel viruses, detailed characterization of these pathogens is indispensable in the context of risk analysis. Here, we describe the identification of a novel HCV-like virus in cattle. In addition, determination of the prevalence and of the course of infection in cattle herds provides valuable insights into the biology of this novel virus. The results presented here form a basis for future studies targeting viral pathogenesis of bovine hepaciviruses and their potential to establish zoonotic infections.

J	Chivero, Ernest T.; Stapleton, Jack T.								Tropism of human pegivirus (formerly known as GB virus C/hepatitis G virus) and host immunomodulation: insights into a highly successful viral infection								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				96				1521	1532		10.1099/vir.0.000086				JUL 2015	2015	Human pegivirus (HPgV; originally called GB virus C/hepatitis G virus) is an RNA virus within the genus Pegivirus of the family Flaviviridae that commonly causes persistent infection. Worldwide, similar to 750 million people are actively infected (viraemic) and an estimated 0.75-1.5 billion people have evidence of prior HPgV infection. No causal association between HPgV and disease has been identified; however, several studies described a beneficial relationship between persistent HPgV infection and survival in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The beneficial effect appeared to be related to a reduction in host immune activation. HPgV replicates well in vivo (mean plasma viral loads typically > 1 x 10(7) genome copies ml(-1)); however, the virus grows poorly in vitro and systems to study this virus are limited. Consequently, mechanisms of viral persistence and host immune modulation remain poorly characterized, and the primary permissive cell type(s) has not yet been identified. HPgV RNA is found in liver, spleen, bone marrow and PBMCs, including T-and B-lymphocytes, NK-cells, and monocytes, although the mechanism of cell-to-cell transmission is unclear. HPgV RNA is also present in serum microvesicles with properties of exosomes. These microvesicles are able to transmit viral RNA to PBMCs in vitro, resulting in productive infection. This review summarizes existing data on HPgV cellular tropism and the effect of HPgV on immune activation in various PBMCs, and discusses how this may influence viral persistence. We conclude that an increased understanding of HPgV replication and immune modulation may provide insights into persistent RNA viral infection of humans.

Here, we provide further analysis of inbred mouse strains. NZW/Lac and C58 mice exhibited more weight loss than other classical inbred strains but all survived intranasal challenges with 10(4) to 10(6) PFU of MPXV. Mice from three wild derived strains, in addition to CAST, exhibited severe weight loss and died or were euthanized. LD50 values for CASA, MOLE and PERA were 100, 6800 and > 10(5) PFU, respectively. CASA was inbred independently from the same founders as CAST, whereas MOLE and PERA are genetically and geographically distinct. The MPXV susceptibility of the F1 progeny of CAST and either C57BL/6 or BALB/c indicated that resistance is dominant. Back-crossing the Fl progeny of C57BL/6 and CAST to CAST suggested more than one independent resistant locus. Published by Elsevier Inc.																					WOS:000355069000017	25791934	
J	Hinton, M. G.; Reisen, W. K.; Wheeler, S. S.; Townsend, A. K.								West Nile Virus Activity in a Winter Roost of American Crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos): Is Bird-To-Bird Transmission Important in Persistence and Amplification?								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY				52	4			683	692		10.1093/jme/tjv040				JUL 2015	2015	Since its emergence in North America, West Nile virus (WNV) has had a large impact on equines, humans, and wild bird communities, yet gaps remain in our understanding of how the virus persists at temperate latitudes when winter temperatures preclude virus replication and host-seeking activity by mosquito vectors. Bird-to-bird transmission at large communal American Crow roosts could provide one mechanism for WNV persistence. Herein, we describe seasonal patterns of crow and Culex mosquito abundance, WNV infection rates, and the prevalence of WNV-positive fecal samples at a winter crow roost to test the hypothesis that bird-to-bird transmission allows WNV to persist at winter crow roosts. Samples were collected from large winter crow roosts in the Sacramento Valley of California from January 2013 until August 2014, encompassing two overwintering roost periods. West Nile virus RNA was detected in local crow carcasses in both summer [13/18 (72% WNV positive)] and winter [18/44 (41% WNV positive)] 2013-2014. Winter infections were unlikely to have arisen by recent bites from infected mosquitoes because Culex host-seeking activity was very low in winter and all Culex mosquitoes collected during winter months tested negative for WNV. Opportunities existed for fecal-oral transfer at the overwintering roost: most carcasses that tested positive for WNV had detectable viral RNA in both kidney and cloacal swabs, suggesting that infected crows were shedding virus in their feces, and >50% of crows at the roost were stained with feces by mid-winter. Moreover, 2.3% of fecal samples collected in late summer, when mosquitoes were active, tested positive for WNV RNA. Nevertheless, none of the 1,119 feces collected from three roosts over two winters contained detectable WNV RNA. This study provided evidence of WNV infection in overwintering American crows without mosquito vector activity, but did not elucidate a mechanism of WNV transmission during winter.

This study aims to describe the importation of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV) into Belgium over a 6-year period from 2007 to 2012. Clinical samples were obtained from travellers presenting at the outpatient clinic of the Institute of Tropical Medicine (ITM), Antwerp, Belgium or submitted to the Central Laboratory for Clinical Biology of the ITM. Testing was performed by serology and/or by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. A total of 1288 returning travellers were investigated for CHIKV infection resulting in 34 confirmed and two probable diagnoses (2.80%). Out of 899 patients, four confirmed and one probable imported WNV infections were diagnosed (0.55%). No locally acquired cases have been registered in Belgium until now and the geographical origin of the imported infections reflects the global locations where the viruses are circulating.

Comparison of Rift Valley fever virus replication in North American livestock and wildlife cell lines								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				6						664	10.3389/fmicb.2015.00664				JUN 30 2015	2015	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) causes disease outbreaks across Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, resulting in high morbidity and mortality among young domestic livestock, frequent abortions in pregnant animals, and potentially severe or fatal disease in humans. The possibility of RVFV spreading to the United States or other countries worldwide is of significant concern to animal and public health, livestock production, and trade. The mechanism for persistence of RVFV during inter-epidemic periods may be through mosquito transovarial transmission and/or by means of a wildlife reservoir. Field investigations in endemic areas and previous in vivo studies have demonstrated that RVFV can infect a wide range of animals, including indigenous wild ruminants of Africa. Yet no predominant wildlife reservoir has been identified, and gaps in our knowledge of RVFV permissive hosts still remain. In North America, domestic goats, sheep, and cattle are susceptible hosts for RVFV and several competent vectors exist. Wild ruminants such as deer might serve as a virus reservoir and given their abundance, wide distribution, and overlap with livestock farms and human populated areas could represent an important risk factor. The objective of this study was to assess a variety of cell lines derived from North American livestock and wildlife for susceptibility and permissiveness to RVFV. Results of this study suggest that RVFV could potentially replicate in native deer species such as white-tailed deer, and possibly a wide range of non-ruminant animals. This work serves to guide and support future animal model studies and risk model assessment regarding this high-consequence zoonotic pathogen.																					WOS:000357302400001	26175725

It is an emerging orthopox-virus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa; it remains a tropical neglected disease of persons in impoverished rural areas. Interaction of the human population with wildlife increases human infection with MPX virus (MPXV), and infection from human to human is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides good cross-protection against MPX; however, the vaccination campaign ended in Africa in 1980, meaning that a large proportion of the population is currently unprotected against MPXV infection. Disease control hinges on deterring zoonotic exposure to the virus and, barring that, interrupting person-to-person spread. However, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPX, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. For this reason, new studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis and therapeutics are still of great interest, not only for the scientific community but also for the governments concerned that MPXV could be used as a bioterror agent. In the present study, a new vaccination strategy approach based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, A29L, M1R and B6R were investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)Delta TK, BoHV-4A-EF1 alpha-M1RgD(106)Delta TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1 alpha-B6RgD(106)Delta TK were successfully constructed by recombineering, and their capacity to express their transgene was demonstrated. A small challenge study was performed, and all three recombinant BoHV-4 appeared safe (no weight-loss or obvious adverse events) following intraperitoneal administration. Further, BoHV-4-AEF1 alpha-M1RgD(106)Delta TK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD(106)Delta TK and BoHV-4-A-EF1 alpha-B6RgD(106)Delta TK, was shown to be able to protect, 100% alone and 80% in combination, STAT1((-/-)) mice against mortality and morbidity. This work demonstrated the efficacy of BoHV-4 based vectors and the use of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform.																					WOS:000357398100046	26086739	
J	Honda, Tomoyuki								Neuropathogenesis of persistent infection with Borna disease virus								Virus (Nagoya)				65	1, Sp. Iss. SI			145	154						JUN 2015	2015	Borna disease virus (BDV), belonging to the non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses, persistently infects the central nervous system of many mammals. Neonatal BDV infection in rodent models induces neurodevelopmental disturbance without overt inflammatory responses, resulting in a wide range of neurobehavioral abnormalities, such as anxiety, abnormal play behaviors, and cognitive deficits, resembling those of autism patients. Therefore, studies of BDV could provide a valuable model to investigate neuropathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the detailed neuropathogenesis of BDV has not been revealed. Here, we proposed two novel mechanisms that may contribute to BDV neuropathology. The first mechanism is abnormal IGF signaling. Using transgenic mice expressing BDV P protein in glial cells (P-Tg) that show neurobehavioral abnormalities resembling those in BDV-infected animals, we found that the upregulation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 3 in the astrocytes disturbs the IGF signaling and induces the Purkinje cell loss in BDV infection. The other is the integration of BDV sequences into the host genome. We recently found that BDV mRNAs are reverse-transcribed and integrated into the genome of infected cells. BDV integrants have the potential to produce their translated products or piRNAs, suggesting that BDV might exhibit the pathogenicity thorough these molecules. We also demonstrated that BDV integrants affect neighboring gene expression. Collectively, BDV integrants may alter transcriptome of infected cells, affecting BDV neuropathology.

The immunomodulating V and W proteins of Nipah virus determine disease course								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				6						7483	10.1038/ncomms8483				JUN 2015	2015	The viral determinants that contribute to Nipah virus (NiV)-mediated disease are poorly understood compared with other paramyxoviruses. Here we use recombinant NiVs ( rNiVs) to examine the contributions of the NiV V and W proteins to NiV pathogenesis in a ferret model. We show that a V-deficient rNiV is susceptible to the innate immune response in vitro and behaves as a replicating non-lethal virus in vivo. Remarkably, rNiV lacking W expression results in a delayed and altered disease course with decreased respiratory disease and increased terminal neurological disease associated with altered in vitro inflammatory cytokine production. This study confirms the V protein as the major determinant of pathogenesis, also being the first in vivo study to show that the W protein modulates the inflammatory host immune response in a manner that determines the disease course.

Most of the modulated cytokines and chemokines were reduced after GBV-C detection, including many proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting an overall antiinflammatory effect of GBV-C in HIV-positive subjects. Most pathways and functions of the measured cytokines were downregulated in cases, except cell death pathways, which were upregulated in various cell subsets in the 3 months after GBV-C detection.Conclusions.aEuro integral GBV-C has a protective effect, in part through a competition mechanism leading to decreased inflammation and improved HIV disease outcome in cases. Further studies are necessary to establish whether GBV-C may have deleterious effects on the host at the cellular level, including depleting the cells that are the targets of HIV.

Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis) exhibit a high seroprevalence for WNV in urban settings where high virus circulation and human spillover have been reported. In Atlanta, Georgia, human cases of WNV are uncommon despite high infection rates in birds and mosquitoes. In this study, we evaluated WNV exposure of eastern gray squirrels in a WNV hot spot in Atlanta.Materials and Methods: Gray squirrels were live-trapped in Grant Park, Atlanta, during July-October, 2012, and a census was conducted to estimate squirrel density in the study site. Sera from trapped animals were tested for circulating virus-by-virus isolation in cell culture and for WNV-specific antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and plaque reduction neutralization test. Mosquitoes were collected at the same location and tested for virus isolation.Results: Among the 69 collected squirrels, 25 (36.2%) tested positive for WNV antibodies, although none were viremic. Seroprevalence was lower in juveniles (18.8%) than in adults (37.5%), but this difference was not statistically significant. Gender and squirrel density had no effect on seroprevalence. Seasonality of squirrel seroprevalence and of mosquito infection were significantly associated, both peaking in August. No difference in squirrel exposure was detected across the collection sites.Conclusions: We report a high degree of WNV exposure in squirrels in Grant Park that was correlated with seasonality of mosquito infection. The detection of antibodies in juveniles suggests that circulation of WNV in the surveyed population is ongoing. Eastern gray squirrels may be suitable indicators for virus amplification and for risk of human spillover on a local scale in urban settings.																					WOS:000354681600003	25988439	
J	Kell, Alison M.; Gale, Michael, Jr.								RIG-I in RNA virus recognition								VIROLOGY				479		SI		110	121		10.1016/j.virol.2015.02.017				MAY 2015	2015	Antiviral immunity is initiated upon host recognition of viral products via non-self molecular patterns known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Such recognition initiates signaling cascades that induce intracellular innate immune defenses and an inflammatory response that facilitates development of the acquired immune response. The retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) protein family are key cytoplasmic pathogen recognition receptors that are implicated in the recognition of viruses across genera and virus families, including functioning as major sensors of RNA viruses, and promoting recognition of some DNA viruses. RIG-I, the charter member of the RLR family, is activated upon binding to PAMP RNA. Activated RIG-I signals by interacting with the adapter protein MAVS leading to a signaling cascade that activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-kappa B. These actions induce the expression of antiviral gene products and the production of type I and III interferons that lead to an antiviral state in the infected cell and surrounding tissue. RIG-I signaling is essential for the control of infection by many RNA viruses. Recently, RIG-I crosstalk with other pathogen recognition receptors and components of the inflammasome has been described. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the role of RIG-I in recognition of a variety of virus families and its role in programming the adaptive immune response through cross-talk with parallel arms of the innate immune system, including how RIG-I can be leveraged for antiviral therapy.

WNV has a history of recent outbreaks in Europe, including Serbia, where it was identified for the first time in 2010 in mosquitoes and in 2012 in birds and humans, being responsible for over 300 confirmed human cases and 35 deaths there along 2013. To assess WNV circulation among mammals in the country, 688 samples obtained from 279 farm pigs, 318 wild boars, and 91 roe deer were investigated for the presence of antibodies to WNV by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and viral neutralization test (VNT), and the specificity of their reactivity was assayed against Usutu virus (USUV). ELISA-reactive sera were identified in 43 (15.4%) pigs, 56(17.6%) wild boars, and 17(18.7%) roe deer. Of these, 6(14%), 33 (59%), and 4(23.5%) respectively, neutralized WNV. One out of the 45 ELISA negative sera tested, from a roe deer, neutralized WNV. Cross-reactivity neutralization test indicated that all deer and pigs neutralizing sera were WNV specific, while in 5 (15.2%) of the wild boar samples the specificity could not be established. Four wild boar sera showed USUV specificity. All these data confirm the circulation of both flaviviruses in Serbia, and highlight the need for the implementation of global coordinated surveillance programs in the region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kock, R. A.								Vertebrate reservoirs and secondary epidemiological cycles of vector-borne diseases								REVUE SCIENTIFIQUE ET TECHNIQUE-OFFICE INTERNATIONAL DES EPIZOOTIES				34	1			151	163		10.20506/rst.34.1.2351				APR 2015	2015	Vector-borne diseases of importance to human and domestic animal health are listed and the increasing emergence of syndromes, new epidemiological cycles and distributions are highlighted. These diseases involve a multitude of vectors and hosts, frequently for the same pathogen, and involve natural enzootic cycles, wild reservoirs and secondary epidemiological cycles, sometimes affecting humans and domestic animals. On occasions the main reservoir is in the domestic environment. Drivers for secondary cycles are mainly related to human impacts and activities and therefore, for purposes of prevention and control, the focus needs to be on the socioecology of the diseases. Technical and therapeutical solutions exist, and for control there needs to be a clear understanding of the main vertebrate hosts or reservoirs and the main vectors. The targets of interventions are usually the vector and/or secondary epidemiological cycles and, in the case of humans and domestic animals, the spillover or incidental hosts are treated. More attention needs to be given to the importance of the political economy in relation to vector-borne diseases, as many key drivers arise from globalisation, climate change and changes in structural ecologies. Attention to reducing the risk of emergence of new infection cycles through better management of the human animal environment interface is urgently needed.

Sequence of Pathogenic Events in Cynomolgus Macaques Infected with Aerosolized Monkeypox Virus								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	8			4335	4344		10.1128/JVI.03029-14				APR 2015	2015	To evaluate new vaccines when human efficacy studies are not possible, the FDA's "Animal Rule" requires well-characterized models of infection. Thus, in the present study, the early pathogenic events of monkeypox infection in nonhuman primates, a surrogate for variola virus infection, were characterized. Cynomolgus macaques were exposed to aerosolized monkeypox virus (10(5) PFU). Clinical observations, viral loads, immune responses, and pathological changes were examined on days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 postchallenge. Viral DNA (vDNA) was detected in the lungs on day 2 postchallenge, and viral antigen was detected, by immunostaining, in the epithelium of bronchi, bronchioles, and alveolar walls. Lesions comprised rare foci of dysplastic and sloughed cells in respiratory bronchioles. By day 4, vDNA was detected in the throat, tonsil, and spleen, and monkeypox antigen was detected in the lung, hilar and submandibular lymph nodes, spleen, and colon. Lung lesions comprised focal epithelial necrosis and inflammation. Body temperature peaked on day 6, pox lesions appeared on the skin, and lesions, with positive immunostaining, were present in the lung, tonsil, spleen, lymph nodes, and colon. By day 8, vDNA was present in 9/13 tissues. Blood concentrations of interleukin 1ra (IL-1ra), IL-6, and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) increased markedly. By day 10, circulating IgG antibody concentrations increased, and on day 12, animals showed early signs of recovery. These results define early events occurring in an inhalational macaque monkeypox infection model, supporting its use as a surrogate model for human smallpox.IMPORTANCEBioterrorism poses a major threat to public health, as the deliberate release of infectious agents, such smallpox or a related virus, monkeypox, would have catastrophic consequences. The development and testing of new medical countermeasures, e.g., vaccines, are thus priorities; however, tests for efficacy in humans cannot be performed because it would be unethical and field trials are not feasible. To overcome this, the FDA may grant marketing approval of a new product based upon the "Animal Rule," in which interventions are tested for efficacy in well-characterized animal models. Monkeypox virus infection of nonhuman primates (NHPs) presents a potential surrogate disease model for smallpox. Previously, the later stages of monkeypox infection were defined, but the early course of infection remains unstudied. Here, the early pathogenic events of inhalational monkeypox infection in NHPs were characterized, and the results support the use of this surrogate model for testing human smallpox interventions.

G.; Heraud, Jean-Michel								Detection of new genetic variants of Betacoronaviruses in Endemic Frugivorous Bats of Madagascar								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				12						42	10.1186/s12985-015-0271-y				MAR 12 2015	2015	Background: Bats are amongst the natural reservoirs of many coronaviruses (CoVs) of which some can lead to severe infection in human. African bats are known to harbor a range of pathogens (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses) that can infect humans and cause disease outbreaks. A recent study in South Africa isolated a genetic variant closely related to MERS-CoV from an insectivorous bat. Though Madagascar is home to 44 bat species (41 insectivorous and 3 frugivorous) of which 34 are endemic, no data exists concerning the circulation of CoVs in the island's chiropteran fauna. Certain Malagasy bats can be frequently found in close contact with humans and frugivorous bats feed in the same trees where people collect and consume fruits and are hunted and consumed as bush meat. The purpose of our study is to detect and identify CoVs from frugivorous bats in Madagascar to evaluate the risk of human infection from infected bats.Methods: Frugivorous bats belonging to three species were captured in four different regions of Madagascar. We analyzed fecal and throat swabs to detect the presence of virus through amplification of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, which is highly conserved in all known coronaviruses. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from positive specimens.Results: From351 frugivorous bats, we detected 14 coronaviruses from two endemic bats species, of which 13 viruses were identified from Pteropus rufus and one from Eidolon dupreanum, giving an overall prevalence of 4.5%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the Malagasy strains belong to the genus Betacoronavirus but form three distinct clusters, which seem to represent previously undescribed genetic lineages.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CoVs circulate in frugivorous bats of Madagascar, demonstrating the needs to evaluate spillover risk to human populations especially for individuals that hunt and consume infected bats. Possible dispersal mechanisms as to how coronaviruses arrived on Madagascar are discussed.																					WOS:000353190700001	25888853	
J	Dadmanesh, Maryam; Ranjbar, Mohammad Mehdi; Alavian, Seyed Moayed; Ghorban, Khodayar								Sequencing and Phylogenetic Study of Partial NS3 Gene of Iranian GB Virus C/Hepatitis G Virus (HGV) Originated From Hemodialysis Patients in Tehran								HEPATITIS MONTHLY				15	3					e24173	10.5812/hepatmon.24173				MAR 2015	2015	Background: Hepatitis viruses are one of the most important concerns in the patients on hemodialysis who are at high risk for blood-borne infections. GB virus C (GBV-C)/hepatitis G virus (HGV) is positive-stranded RNA virus with global distribution, which codes structural and nonstructural proteins (such as NS3).Objectives: Review on literature about Iranian HGV isolates showed that there was no report on sequencing and phylogenetic characteristics of NS3 gene and therefore, this study attempted to answers these challenges.Materials and Methods: Briefly, steps followed were as follows: preparation of nucleic acids from three Iranian hemodialysis HGV-positive samples and RNA extraction; reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) for amplification of NS3 gene and gel electrophoresis; sequencing and analyzing sequencing data; NCBI Registering; blasting and alignment of sequences; and finally constructing the phylogenetic tree.Results: Nucleotide BLAST results emphasized that most similar sequences to Ir NS3 sequences were those from Europe (Spain, Germany, and the United Kingdom) and the United states and IR sequences were located with five leaves in a branch. In addition, homology of Ir sequences showed96.4% (between IR1 and IR2), 94.9% identity (between IR1 and IR3), and 96.5% identity (between IR2 and IR3). Furthermore, highly variation and significance differences in NS3 between GBC isolates from geographical regions and some little changes in IR sequences were seen. Finally, phylogenetic tree revealed that NS3 genotype of Iranian isolates was probably similar to European countries and USA.Conclusions: Overall, results of present study were consistent with the data reported earlier base on 5' NTR in Iranian isolates and revealed genotype IR2 is major genotype in Iranian HGV-positive patient. It means there are higher similarities between Iranian and Europe-USA in HGV NS3 gene.																					WOS:000352233600002	25838830

Complex Epidemiology of a Zoonotic Disease in a Culturally Diverse Region: Phylogeography of Rabies Virus in the Middle East								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				9	3					e0003569	10.1371/journal.pntd.0003569				MAR 2015	2015	The Middle East is a culturally and politically diverse region at the gateway between Europe, Africa and Asia. Spatial dynamics of the fatal zoonotic disease rabies among countries of the Middle East and surrounding regions is poorly understood. An improved understanding of virus distribution is necessary to direct control methods. Previous studies have suggested regular trans-boundary movement, but have been unable to infer direction. Here we address these issues, by investigating the evolution of 183 rabies virus isolates collected from over 20 countries between 1972 and 2014. We have undertaken a discrete phylogeographic analysis on a subset of 139 samples to infer where and when movements of rabies have occurred. We provide evidence for four genetically distinct clades with separate origins currently circulating in the Middle East and surrounding countries. Introductions of these viruses have been followed by regular and multidirectional trans-boundary movements in some parts of the region, but relative isolation in others. There is evidence for minimal regular incursion of rabies from Central and Eastern Asia. These data support current initiatives for regional collaboration that are essential for rabies elimination.																					WOS:000352199400041	25811659

Both viruses induce generalized vasculitis affecting particularly the respiratory tract and CNS. The exceptionally broad species tropism of Henipavirus, the high case fatality rate and person-to-person transmission associated with Nipah virus outbreaks emphasize the necessity of effective antiviral strategies for these intriguing threatening pathogens. Current therapeutic approaches, validated in animal models, target early steps in viral infection; they include the use of neutralizing virus-specific antibodies and blocking membrane fusion with peptides that bind the viral fusion protein. A better understanding of Henipavirus pathogenesis is critical for the further advancement of antiviral treatment, and we summarize here the recent progress in the field.

J	Scheel, Troels K. H.; Simmonds, Peter; Kapoor, Amit								Surveying the global virome: Identification and characterization of HCV-related animal hepaciviruses								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				115				83	93		10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.12.014				MAR 2015	2015	Recent advances in sequencing technologies have greatly enhanced our abilities to identify novel microbial sequences. Thus, our understanding of the global virome and the virome of specific host species in particular is rapidly expanding. Identification of animal viruses is important for understanding animal disease, the origin and evolution of human viruses, as well as zoonotic reservoirs for emerging infections. Although the human hepacivirus, hepatitis C virus (HCV), was identified 25 years ago, its origin has remained elusive. In 2011, the first HCV homolog was reported in dogs but subsequent studies showed the virus to be widely distributed in horses. This indicated a wider hepacivirus host range and paved the way for identification of rodent, bat and non-human primate hepaciviruses. The equine non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV) remains the closest relative of HCV and is so far the best characterized. Identification and characterization of novel hepaciviruses may in addition lead to development of tractable animal models to study HCV persistence, immune responses and pathogenesis. This could be particular important, given the current shortage of immunocompetent models for robust HCV infection. Much remains to be learned on the novel hepaciviruses, including their association with disease, and thereby how relevant they will become as HCV model systems and for studies of animal disease. This review discusses how virome analysis led to identification of novel hepaci- and pegiviruses, their genetic relationship and characterization and the potential use of animal hepaciviruses as models to study hepaciviral infection, immunity and pathogenesis.

Detailed Analysis of the African Green Monkey Model of Nipah Virus Disease								PLOS ONE				10	2					e0117817	10.1371/journal.pone.0117817				FEB 23 2015	2015	Henipaviruses are implicated in severe and frequently fatal pneumonia and encephalitis in humans. There are no approved vaccines or treatments available for human use, and testing of candidates requires the use of well-characterized animal models that mimic human disease. We performed a comprehensive and statistically-powered evaluation of the African green monkey model to define parameters critical to disease progression and the extent to which they correlate with human disease. African green monkeys were inoculated by the intratracheal route with 2.5x10(4) plaque forming units of the Malaysia strain of Nipah virus. Physiological data captured using telemetry implants and assessed in conjunction with clinical pathology were consistent with shock, and histopathology confirmed widespread tissue involvement associated with systemic vasculitis in animals that succumbed to acute disease. In addition, relapse encephalitis was identified in 100% of animals that survived beyond the acute disease phase. Our data suggest that disease progression in the African green monkey is comparable to the variable outcome of Nipah virus infection in humans.																					WOS:000350662100120	25706617

Characterization of nonprimate hepacivirus and construction of a functional molecular clone								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				112	7			2192	2197		10.1073/pnas.1500265112				FEB 17 2015	2015	Nonprimate hepacivirus (NPHV) is the closest known relative of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and its study could enrich our understanding of HCV evolution, immunity, and pathogenesis. High seropositivity is found in horses worldwide with similar to 3% viremic. NPHV natural history and molecular virology remain largely unexplored, however. Here, we show that NPHV, like HCV, can cause persistent infection for over a decade, with high titers and negative strand RNA in the liver. NPHV is a near-universal contaminant of commercial horse sera for cell culture. The complete NPHV 3'-UTR was determined and consists of interspersed homopolymer tracts and an HCV-like 3'-terminal poly(U)-X-tail. NPHV translation is stimulated by miR-122 and the 3'-UTR and, similar to HCV, the NPHV NS3-4A protease can cleave mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein to inactivate the retinoic acid-inducible gene I pathway. Using an NPHV consensus cDNA clone, replication was not observed in primary equine fetal liver cultures or after electroporation of selectable replicons. However, intrahepatic RNA inoculation of a horse initiated infection, yielding high RNA titers in the serum and liver. Delayed seroconversion, slightly elevated circulating liver enzymes and mild hepatitis was observed, followed by viral clearance. This establishes themolecular components of a functional NPHV genome. Thus, NPHV appears to resemble HCV not only in genome structure but also in its ability to establish chronic infection with delayed seroconversion and hepatitis. This NPHV infectious clone and resulting acute phase sera will facilitate more detailed studies on the natural history, pathogenesis, and immunity of this novel hepacivirus in its natural host.

J	Chaudhri, Geeta; Tahiliani, Vikas; Eldi, Preethi; Karupiah, Gunasegaran								Vaccine-Induced Protection against Orthopoxvirus Infection Is Mediated through the Combined Functions of CD4 T Cell-Dependent Antibody and CD8 T Cell Responses								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	3			1889	1899		10.1128/JVI.02572-14				FEB 2015	2015	Antibody production by B cells in the absence of CD4 T cell help has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for protection against secondary orthopoxvirus (OPV) infections. This conclusion is based on short-term depletion of leukocyte subsets in vaccinated animals, in addition to passive transfer of immune serum to naive hosts that are subsequently protected from lethal orthopoxvirus infection. Here, we show that CD4 T cell help is necessary for neutralizing antibody production and virus control during a secondary ectromelia virus (ECTV) infection. A crucial role for CD4 T cells was revealed when depletion of this subset was extended beyond the acute phase of infection. Sustained depletion of CD4 T cells over several weeks in vaccinated animals during a secondary infection resulted in gradual diminution of B cell responses, including neutralizing antibody, contemporaneous with a corresponding increase in the viral load. Long-term elimination of CD8 T cells alone delayed virus clearance, but prolonged depletion of both CD4 and CD8 T cells resulted in death associated with uncontrolled virus replication. In the absence of CD4 T cells, perforin-and granzyme A-and B-dependent effector functions of CD8 T cells became critical. Our data therefore show that both CD4 T cell help for antibody production and CD8 T cell effector function are critical for protection against secondary OPV infection. These results are consistent with the notion that the effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine is related to its capacity to induce both B and T cell memory.

Fifty-three percent of these GBV-C+ patients survived; in contrast, only 22% of GBV-C- patients survived. Both survival and GBV-C status were associated with age, with older patients having lower survival rates and intermediate-age patients (21 to 45 years) having the highest rate of GBV-C infection. Understanding the separate and combined effects of GBV-C and age on Ebola virus survival may lead to new treatment and prevention strategies, perhaps through age-related pathways of immune activation.

Recently, several studies identified close relatives to HCV in different animal species. Among these novel viruses, the nonprimate hepaciviruses (NPHV) that infect horses are the closest relatives of HCV described to date. In this study, we analyzed the NPHV prevalence in northern Germany and characterized the clinical course of infection and viral tissue tropism to explore the relevance of HCV-related horse viruses as a model for HCV infection. We found that approximately 31.4% of 433 horses were seropositive for antibodies (Abs) against NPHV and approximately 2.5% carried viral RNA. Liver function analyses revealed no indication for hepatic impairment in 7 of 11 horses. However, serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) concentrations were mildly elevated in 3 horses, and 1 horse displayed even highly elevated GGT levels. Furthermore, we observed that NPHV infection could be cleared in individual horses with a simultaneous emergence of nonstructural (NS)3-specific Abs and transient elevation of serum levels of liver-specific enzymes indicative for a hepatic inflammation. In other individual horses, chronic infections could be observed with the copresence of viral RNA and NS3-specific Abs for over 6 months. For the determination of viral tissue tropism, we analyzed different organs and tissues of 1 NPHV-positive horse using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and fluorescent in situ hydridization and detected NPHV RNA mainly in the liver and at lower amounts in other organs. Conclusion: Similar to HCV infections in humans, this work demonstrates acute and chronic stages of NPHV infection in horses with viral RNA detectable predominantly within the liver.

Several small animal models for studying monkeypox virus pathogenesis have been investigated. The African dormouse is a candidate natural host but is outbred and no immunological reagents exist. Although not a natural host, the CAST/EiJ mouse is inbred and animals and reagents are commercially available. We compared the dissemination of monkeypox virus by bioluminescence imaging in CAST/EiJ mice and dormice. In CAST/EiJ mice, intense replication occurred at the intranasal site of inoculation and virus spread rapidly to lungs and abdominal organs, which had a lower virus burden. Compared to CAST/EiJ mice, dormice exhibited a greater variation of virus spread, a slower time course, less replication in the head and chest, and more replication in abdominal organs prior to death.

They are zoonotic agents with bats as primary reservoir. Those viruses can cause severe human infection with hemorrhagic syndrome leading to death. The mortality rate can be higher than 90%. In West Africa, recent Ebola virus outbreak occurred in March 2014, has caused more than 8 300 infections with more than 4 000 deaths. That shows the critical state of this country, and the critical context in worldwide. In order to fight this deadly scourge, it is necessary to understand the epidemiology of disease and to establish a good diagnosis protocols and protective measures. In recent decades, traditional techniques of virus isolation are replaced by molecular biology techniques which are faster, more sensitive and specific. Until now, no specific Ebola virus treatment or vaccine but many studies are in progress with promising results.																					BCI:BCI201500483907

WNV, an enveloped virus of the genus Flavivirus, is naturally maintained in an enzootic cycle between birds and mosquitoes, with occasional epizootic spillover causing disease in humans and horses. The mosquito vectors for WNV are widely distributed worldwide, and the known geographic range of WNV transmission and disease has continued to increase over the past 77 years. While most human infections with WNV are asymptomatic, severe neurological disease may develop resulting in long-term sequelae or death. Surveillance and preventive measures are an ongoing need to reduce the public health impact of WNV in areas with the potential for transmission.																					WOS:000352410100001	25866777

Unfortunately, such animals are susceptible to and potential reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens. Close proximity to and contact with pets can lead to human infections. The distribution of zoonotic diseases associated with companion animals such as dogs and cats is not uniform around the world, and moving animals between regions, countries, and continents carries with it the risk of relocating the pathogens they might harbor. Critical among these zoonotic diseases are rabies, echinococcosis, and leishmania. In addition, the protozoan parasites, Toxoplasma gondii and Giardia duodenalis, are also significant agents for human disease of pet origin. Considerable effort is applied to controlling movements of companion animals, particularly dogs, into the European Union. However, free movement of people and their pets within the European Union is a risk factor for the translocation of diseases and their vectors. This review considers the current distribution of some of these diseases, the risks associated with pet travel, and the controls implemented within Europe to prevent the free movement of zoonotic pathogens.

Since the identification of RVF in Kenya in the 1930s, repeated epizootics and epidemics coinciding with El Nino events have occurred in several locations in Africa and Saudi Arabia, causing mass deaths of livestock and humans. RVF is of great interest worldwide because of its negative effect on international livestock trade and its potential to spread globally. The latter is due to the increasing incidence of extreme climatic phenomena caused by global warming, as well as to the increase in global trade and international travel. How RVF is maintained and sustained between epidemics and epizootics is not clearly understood, but it has been speculated that wildlife reservoirs and trans-ovarian transmission in the vector may be important. Several studies have examined the role of wildlife and livestock in isolation or in a limited geographical location within the one country over a short time (usually less than a year). In this study, we examined the seroprevalence of anti-RVF antibodies in cattle and several wildlife species from several locations in Kenya over an inter-epidemic period spanning up to 7 years.Methods: A serological survey of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to RVF using competitive ELISA was undertaken on 297 serum samples from different wildlife species at various locations in Kenya. The samples were collected between 2008 and 2015. Serum was also collected in 2014 from 177 cattle from Ol Pejeta Conservancy; 113 of the cattle were in close contact with wildlife and the other 64 were kept separate from buffalo and large game by an electric fence.Results: The seroprevalence of RVF virus (RVFV) antibody was 11.6% in wildlife species during the study period. Cattle that could come in contact with wildlife and large game were all negative for RVFV. The seroprevalence was relatively high in elephants, rhinoceros, and buffalo, but there were no antibodies in zebras, baboons, vervet monkeys, or wildebeest.Conclusions: Diverse species in conservation areas are exposed to RVFV. RVFV exposure in buffalo may indicate distribution of the virus over wide geographical areas beyond known RVFV foci in Kenya. This finding calls for thorough studies on the epizootology of RVFV in specific wildlife species and locations.																					BCI:BCI201700268823	26679561

Over the past three decades, the incidence of rabies had decreased substantially and vast areas of Western and Central Europe have been freed from rabies using this method of controlling an infectious disease in wildlife. Since rabies control is a top priority in the EU, the disease is expected to be eliminated from the animal source in the near future. While responsible authorities may consider the mission of eliminating fox rabies from the EU almost accomplished, there are still issues to be dealt with and challenges to be met that have not yet been in the focus of attention, but could jeopardise the ultimate goal. Among them are increasing illegal movements of animals, maintaining funding support for vaccination campaigns, devising alternative vaccine strategies in neighbouring Eastern European countries and the expanding distribution range of several potential rabies reservoir species in Europe.

We combined computing applications, molecular detection, and nucleotide sequencing of coronaviruses, hantaviruses, paramyxoviruses and pegiviruses with ecological and phylogenetic analyses. A total of 22 viruses were discovered in 1,067 samples from 42 bat species, representing an estimated 78% of all viral richness in the system. Based on 17 virus genotypes discovered with an equal sampling effort, a total viral richness of 23 genotypes was estimated using a Chao2 statistic model. Using a residual model, we categorized host species and habitat types that are prone to harboring higher viral richness. Positive relationships were found between phylogenetic host diversity and both viral diversity (r = 0.41, p < 0.05) and viral richness (r = 0.51, p < 0.05). The beta diversity (the rate of change) of viral communities was explained by host beta diversity (r = 0.86, p < 0.05). To understand the change in viral and host communities, we partitioned beta diversity in nestedness (species loss) and turnover (compositional dissimilarity) components. In Chiapas, the host beta diversity was explained by the nestedness of species composition, while the phylogenetic host diversity was explained by turnover of the host lineages. Campeche showed a high phylogenetic host nestedness and low host turnover. Beta-diversity and beta-phylogenetic diversity indicated that patterns of local species assemblages and regional abiotic features in human-dominated landscapes are significant drivers of viral community composition. Our study represents the first effort in Mexico to study the relationship between viral diversity in bat communities in modified landscapes to understand host-virus relationships.	Mediante análisis epidemiológicos integrales, se estudiaron la diversidad beta (entre sitios) y la beta filogenética de sistemas multi-hospederos, así como los virus asociados con comunidades de murciélagos en paisajes fragmentados de Chiapas, Campeche y la zona metropolitana de la Ciudad de México. Se combinaron aplicaciones computacionales, técnicas de detección molecular y la secuenciación de nucleótidos de coronavirus, hantavirus, paramyxovirus y pegivirus con análisis ecológicos y filogenéticos. Se descubrieron un total de 22 virus en 1 067 muestras pertenecientes a 42 especies de murciélagos, lo que representa una estimación de 78% de la riqueza viral total. Al aplicar el modelo estadístico Chao2 con datos de los 17 genotipos de virus encontrados con el mismo esfuerzo de muestreo, se calculó una riqueza viral de 23 genotipos. Usando un modelo con residuales, se categorizó a las especies hospederas y los tipos de hábitat que tienen mayor riesgo de asociarse con una mayor riqueza viral. Se encontró una relación positiva entre la diversidad filogenética de los hospederos y la diversidad viral (r = 0.41, P < 0.05) y con la riqueza viral (r = 0.51, P < 0.05). La diversidad beta (tasa de recambio) de las comunidades de virus se explicó por la diversidad beta de los hospederos (r = 0.86, P < 0.05). Para entender los patrones de cambio en las comunidades virales y de hospederos, la diversidad beta se dividió en: un componente de anidamiento -pérdida de especies- y uno de recambio -disimilitud en la composición-. En Chiapas, la diversidad beta de los hospederos se justificó por la anidación de especies, mientras que la diversidad beta filogenética se definió por el recambio de linaje de los hospederos. Campeche mostró altos valores de anidamiento filogenético y bajo recambio de hospederos. La diversidad beta y la diversidad beta filogenética indicaron que los patrones locales de la estructura de las comunidades de hospederos y las características abióticas regionales en paisajes dominados por actividades antropogénicas son un factor importante en la determinación de la composición de comunidades virales. Este estudio representa el primer esfuerzo en México para entender las relaciones hospedero-virus, a través del estudio de las relaciones entre la diversidad viral y las comunidades de murciélagos en paisajes transformados.

The biology of these viruses is characterized by unique and interesting features that are both crucial for their success as pathogens and challenging from a scientific point of view. Elucidation of these features at the molecular level has made striking progress during recent years. The analyses revealed that major aspects of pestivirus biology show significant similarity to the biology of human hepatitis C virus (HCV). The detailed molecular analyses conducted for pestiviruses and HCV supported and complemented each other during the last three decades resulting in elucidation of the functions of viral proteins and RNA elements in replication and virus-host interaction. For pestiviruses, the analyses also helped to shed light on the molecular basis of persistent infection, a special strategy these viruses have evolved to be maintained within their host population. The results of these investigations are summarized in this chapter.																					WOS:000405426600002	26111586

Efficient Reverse Genetics Reveals Genetic Determinants of Budding and Fusogenic Differences between Nipah and Hendra Viruses and Enables Real-Time Monitoring of Viral Spread in Small Animal Models of Henipavirus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	2			1242	1253		10.1128/JVI.02583-14				JAN 2015	2015	Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are closely related henipaviruses of the Paramyxo virinae. Spillover from their fruit bat reservoirs can cause severe disease in humans and livestock. Despite their high sequence similarity, NiV and HeV exhibit apparent differences in receptor and tissue tropism, envelope-mediated fusogenicity, replicative fitness, and other pathophysiologic manifestations. To investigate the molecular basis for these differences, we first established a highly efficient reverse genetics system that increased rescue titers by >= 3 log units, which offset the difficulty of generating multiple recombinants under constraining biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) conditions. We then replaced, singly and in combination, the matrix (M), fusion (F), and attachment glycoprotein (G) genes in mCherry-expressing recombinant NiV (rNiV) with their HeV counterparts. These chimeric but isogenic rNiVs replicated well in primary human endothelial and neuronal cells, indicating efficient heterotypic complementation. The determinants of budding efficiency, fusogenicity, and replicative fitness were dissociable: HeV-M budded more efficiently than NiV-M, accounting for the higher replicative titers of HeV-M-bearing chimeras at early times, while the enhanced fusogenicity of NiV-G-bearing chimeras did not correlate with increased replicative fitness. Furthermore, to facilitate spatiotemporal studies on henipavirus pathogenesis, we generated a firefly luciferase-expressing NiV and monitored virus replication and spread in infected interferon alpha/beta receptor knockout mice via bioluminescence imaging. While intraperitoneal inoculation resulted in neuroinvasion following systemic spread and replication in the respiratory tract, intranasal inoculation resulted in confined spread to regions corresponding to olfactory bulbs and salivary glands before subsequent neuroinvasion. This optimized henipavirus reverse genetics system will facilitate future investigations into the growing numbers of novel henipavirus-like viruses.IMPORTANCE Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are recently emergent zoonotic and highly lethal pathogens with pandemic potential Although differences have been observed between NiV and HeV replication and pathogenesis, the molecular basis for these differences has not been examined. In this study, we established a highly efficient system to reverse engineer changes into replication-competent NiV and HeV, which facilitated the generation of reporter-expressing viruses and recombinant NiV-HeV chimeras with substitutions in the genes responsible for viral exit (the M gene, critical for assembly and budding) and viral entry (the G [attachment] and F [fusion] genes). These chimeras revealed differences in the budding and fusogenic properties of the M and G proteins, respectively, which help explain previously observed differences between NiV and HeV. Finally, to facilitate future in vivo studies, we monitored the replication and spread of a bioluminescent reporter-expressing NiV in susceptible mice; this is the first time such in vivo imaging has been performed under BSL-4 conditions.

Identification of an Unclassified Paramyxovirus in Coleura afra: A Potential Case of Host Specificity								PLOS ONE				9	12					e115588	10.1371/journal.pone.0115588				DEC 31 2014	2014	Bats are known to harbor multiple paramyxoviruses. Despite the creation of two new genera, Aquaparamyxovirus and Ferlavirus, to accommodate this increasing diversity, several recently isolated or characterized viruses remain unclassified beyond the subfamily level. In the present study, among 985 bats belonging to 6 species sampled in the Belinga caves of Gabon, RNA of an unclassified paramyxovirus (Belinga bat virus, BelPV) was discovered in 14 African sheathtailed bats (Coleura afra), one of which exhibited several hemorrhagic lesions at necropsy, and viral sequence was obtained in two animals. Phylogenetically, BelPV is related to J virus and Beilong virus (BeiPV), two other unclassified paramyxoviruses isolated from rodents. In the diseased BelPV-infected C. afra individual, high viral load was detected in the heart, and the lesions were consistent with those reported in wild rodents and mice experimentally infected by J virus. BelPV was not detected in other tested bat species sharing the same roosting sites and living in very close proximity with C. afra in the two caves sampled, suggesting that this virus may be host-specific for C. afra. The mode of transmission of this paramyxovirus in bat populations remains to be discovered.																					WOS:000347119100045	25551455

This prompted us to assess whether a delta inulin-adjuvanted, inactivated cell culture-derived Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine (JE-ADVAX(TM)) could be used in horses, including pregnant mares and foals, to not only induce immunity to JEV, but also elicit cross-protective antibodies against MVEV and WNVKUN. Foals, 74-152 days old, received two injections of JE-ADVAX(TM). The vaccine was safe and well-tolerated and induced a strong JEV-neutralizing antibody response in all foals. MVEV and WNVKUN antibody cross-reactivity was seen in 33% and 42% of the immunized foals, respectively. JE-ADVAX(TM) was also safe and well-tolerated in pregnant mares and induced high JEV-neutralizing titers. The neutralizing activity was passively transferred to their foals via colostrum. Foals that acquired passive immunity to JEV via maternal antibodies then were immunized with JE-ADVAX(TM) at 36-83 days of age, showed evidence of maternal antibody interference with low peak antibody titers post-immunization when compared to immunized foals of JEV naive dams. Nevertheless, when given a single JE-ADVAX(TM) booster immunization as yearlings, these animals developed a rapid and robust JEV-neutralizing antibody response, indicating that they were successfully primed to JEV when immunized as foals, despite the presence of maternal antibodies. Overall, JE-ADVAX(TM) appears safe and well-tolerated in pregnant mares and young foals and induces protective levels of JEV neutralizing antibodies with partial cross-neutralization of MVEV and WNVKUN.

Even with rapidly advancing scientific technologies this disease still poses a significant threat due to a lack of vaccines and affordable treatment options. The immune correlates of protection and predisposing factors toward chronicity remain major obstacles to development of HCV vaccines and immunotherapeutics due, at least in part, to lack of a tangible infection animal model. This review discusses the currently available animal models for HCV disease with a primary focus on GB virus B(GBV-B) infection of New World primates that recapitulates the dual Hepacivirus phenotypes of acute viral clearance and chronic pathologic disease. HCV and GBV-B are also closely phylogenetically related and advances in characterization of the immune systems of New World primates have already led to the use of this model for drug testing and vaccine trials. Herein, we discuss the benefits and caveats of the GBV-B infection model and discuss potential avenues for future development of novel vaccines and immunotherapies.

However, it is unknown whether the nuclear localization of N-pro correlates with the virulence of CSFV in the host. Previously, we showed that the N-pro protein fused with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was present only in the cytoplasm. Here, we generated and evaluated a recombinant CSFV vSM-IRF3 harboring the IRF3 gene inserted into the N-pro gene of the highly virulent CSFV Shimen strain. Compared to the even nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-N-pro fusion expressed by the recombinant CSFV EGFP-CSFV, vSM-IRF3 expressed an IRF3-N-pro fusion protein that only was localized in the cytoplasm. vSM-IRF3 was markedly attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and the inoculated pigs were completely protected from lethal CSFV challenge, whereas the parental virus as well as EGFP-CSFV exhibited a typical virulent phenotype. Taken together, the nuclear localization of N-pro plays a significant role in the CSFV replication and virulence. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nicolas, Gaelle; Chevalier, Veronique; Tantely, Luciano Michael; Fontenille, Didier; Durand, Benoit								A Spatially Explicit Metapopulation Model and Cattle Trade Analysis Suggests Key Determinants for the Recurrent Circulation of Rift Valley Fever Virus in a Pilot Area of Madagascar Highlands								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				8	12					e3346	10.1371/journal.pntd.0003346				DEC 2014	2014	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 20082009, a RVF outbreak affected the whole Madagascar island, including the Anjozorobe district located in Madagascar highlands. An entomological survey showed the absence of Aedes among the potential RVF virus (RVFV) vector species identified in this area, and an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals of the area, suggesting an absence of wild RVF virus (RVFV) reservoir. However, a three years serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent RVFV circulation. The objective of this study was to understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission. To achieve this goal, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions using observational data collected in the area. Three scenarios that could explain the RVFV recurrent circulation in the area were analyzed: (i) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, vectors being absent during the winter, (ii) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population, without direct transmission between cattle, (iii) combination of both above mentioned mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations, 84% of cattle infections being attributed to vector-borne transmission, and 16% to direct transmission. These results appeared robust according to the sensitivity analysis. Interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices could be a key element for understanding RVFV circulation in this area of Madagascar highlands.

HPgV RNA prevalence among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive injecting drug users was similar to HIV-positive pregnant women, as was the case when comparing HIV-negative injecting drug users and HIV-negative pregnant women (P>0.05). HPgV genotype 2 (HPgV/2) was prevalent among both Argentine injecting drug users and pregnant women, in contrast to HPgV/3 observed among pregnant women from Latin American countries with predominant indigenous populations and who had experienced their initial sexual intercourses--and possibly their source of infection--in those countries (P<0.01). In addition, HPgV vertical and horizontal transmission was proven by molecular analysis of E2 gene and construction of identity matrixes with epidemiologically non-related isolates. This study shows that human migration from neighboring Latin American countries with predominant indigenous populations might contribute to HPgV/3 circulation in Argentina. J. Med.

In vitro evolution of high-titer, virus-like vesicles containing a single structural protein								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				111	47			16866	16871		10.1073/pnas.1414991111				NOV 25 2014	2014	Self-propagating, infectious, virus-like vesicles (VLVs) are generated when an alphavirus RNA replicon expresses the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV G) as the only structural protein. The mechanism that generates these VLVs lacking a capsid protein has remained a mystery for over 20 years. We present evidence that VLVs arise from membrane-enveloped RNA replication factories (spherules) containing VSV G protein that are largely trapped on the cell surface. After extensive passaging, VLVs evolve to grow to high titers through acquisition of multiple point mutations in their nonstructural replicase proteins. We reconstituted these mutations into a plasmid-based system from which high-titer VLVs can be recovered. One of these mutations generates a late domain motif (PTAP) that is critical for high-titer VLV production. We propose a model in which the VLVs have evolved in vitro to exploit a cellular budding pathway that is hijacked by many enveloped viruses, allowing them to bud efficiently from the cell surface. Our results suggest a basic mechanism of propagation that may have been used by primitive RNA viruses lacking capsid proteins. Capsids may have evolved later to allow more efficient packaging of RNA, greater virus stability, and evasion of innate immunity.																					WOS:000345662700055	25385608

Absence of nonprimate hepacivirus-related genomes in blood donors seroreactive for hepatitis C virus displaying indeterminate blot patterns								JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS				21	11			E164	E166		10.1111/jvh.12252				NOV 2014	2014	Despite intensive search, no primate homologue to the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) has ever been found. The search for a zoonotic origin for HCV has been renewed recently when a virus, now known as non-primate hepacivirus (NPHV), with a high homology to HCV was found in dogs. A variable proportion of anti-HCV reactive blood donors submitted to the immunoblot (IB) to confirm their HCV status, present indeterminate results. The degree of homology between HCV and NPHV suggests that humans may be infected by NPHV or NPHV-like viruses. Maximum similarity between NHPV and HCV is observed in the nonstructural regions 3 and 5. Peptides representing both domains are present in IB assays, so it is reasonable to suppose that blood donors harboring such viruses may display cross-reactivity to the HCV antigenic fractions. Fifty-nine plasma samples from blood donors found reactive for anti-HCV and presenting IB indeterminate results were submitted to five distinct PCR reactions under low-stringency conditions, employing primers targeting GBV-C 5'UTR and NS3, Flavivirus-genus NS5 and NPHV 5'UTR and NS3. No amplification was obtained with all primer pairs tested except for five samples that amplified both 5'UTR and NS3 fragments from GBV-C. Unbiased next-generation sequencing may prove or rule out the existence of HCV-related viruses in IB indeterminate samples.																					WOS:000342844900003	24689976

Recent studies suggest that GBV-C infection in HIV-positive people is associated with prolonged survival. In vitro co-infection of GBV-C and HIV lead to decreased HIV replication, enhancing immunity and slowing down the progress of disease in patients with HIV. Further understanding of these mechanisms may open new strategies for the therapeutic agents of HIV/AIDS. In this paper we reviewed the interaction and mechanisms of GBV-C and HIV.																					BCI:BCI201500086208

Mark								Co-administration of the broad-spectrum antiviral, brincidofovir (CMX001), with smallpox vaccine does not compromise vaccine protection in mice challenged with ectromelia virus								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				111				42	52		10.1016/j.antiviral.2014.08.003				NOV 2014	2014	Natural orthopoxvirus outbreaks such as vaccinia, cowpox, cattlepox and buffalopox continue to cause morbidity in the human population. Monkeypox virus remains a significant agent of morbidity and mortality in Africa. Furthermore, monkeypox virus's broad host-range and expanding environs make it of particular concern as an emerging human pathogen. Monkeypox virus and variola virus (the etiological agent of smallpox) are both potential agents of bioterrorism. The first line response to orthopoxvirus disease is through vaccination with first-generation and second-generation vaccines, such as Dryvax and ACAM2000. Although these vaccines provide excellent protection, their widespread use is impeded by the high level of adverse events associated with vaccination using live, attenuated virus. It is possible that vaccines could be used in combination with antiviral drugs to reduce the incidence and severity of vaccine-associated adverse events, or as a preventive in individuals with uncertain exposure status or contraindication to vaccination. We have used the intranasal mousepox (ectromelia) model to evaluate the efficacy of vaccination with Dryvax or ACAM2000 in conjunction with treatment using the broad spectrum antiviral, brincidofovir (BCV, CMX001). We found that co-treatment with BCV reduced the severity of vaccination-associated lesion development. Although the immune response to vaccination was quantifiably attenuated, vaccination combined with BCV treatment did not alter the development of full protective immunity, even when administered two days following ectromelia challenge. Studies with a non-replicating vaccine, ACAM3000 (MVA), confirmed that BCV's mechanism of attenuating the immune response following vaccination with live virus was, as expected, by limiting viral replication and not through inhibition of the immune system. These studies suggest that, in the setting of post-exposure prophylaxis, co-administration of BCV with vaccination should be considered a first response to a smallpox emergency in subjects of uncertain exposure status or as a means of reduction of the incidence and severity of vaccine-associated adverse events.

Current status of rabies and prospects for elimination								LANCET				384	9951			1389	1399		10.1016/S0140-6736(13)62707-5				OCT 11 2014	2014	Rabies is one of the most deadly infectious diseases, with a case-fatality rate approaching 100%. The disease is established on all continents apart from Antarctica; most cases are reported in Africa and Asia, with thousands of deaths recorded annually. However, the estimated annual figure of almost 60 000 human rabies fatalities is probably an underestimate. Almost all cases of human rabies result from bites from infected dogs. Therefore, the most cost-effective approach to elimination of the global burden of human rabies is to control canine rabies rather than expansion of the availability of human prophylaxis. Mass vaccination campaigns with parenteral vaccines, and advances in oral vaccines for wildlife, have allowed the elimination of rabies in terrestrial carnivores in several countries worldwide. The subsequent reduction in cases of human rabies in such regions advocates the multidisciplinary One Health approach to rabies control through the mass vaccination of dogs and control of canine populations.

GBV-C Infection and Risk of NHL among US Adults								CANCER RESEARCH				74	19			5553	5560		10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-0209				OCT 1 2014	2014	Some retrospective studies suggest an association between infection with GB virus-C (GBV-C) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). We evaluated this association prospectively in a nested case-control study within the U.S. Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Cases (N = 658) and controls (N = 1,316) were individually matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity, timing of study entry, and sample selection. Prediagnostic PLCO serum samples were tested for GBV-C RNA (as a measure of active infection) and E2 antibody (active or resolved infection). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) for the association between GBV-C and NHL overall and NHL subtypes. Twelve cases (1.8%) and seven controls (0.5%) were GBV-C RNA-positive. GBV-C RNA positivity was associated with NHL overall [OR, 3.43; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.35-8.71] and, based on small numbers, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (OR, 5.31; 95% CI, 1.54-18.36). The association with NHL persisted when the interval between testing and selection was greater than 4 years (OR, 6.00; 95% CI, 1.21-29.73). In contrast, E2 antibody positivity was not associated with NHL risk (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.74-1.58). Our study demonstrates that GBV-C infection precedes development of NHL. GBV-C infection may play an etiologic role in a small proportion of NHL cases, perhaps by causing chronic immune stimulation or impaired immunosurveillance. (C) 2014 AACR.

J	Annand, E. J.; Reid, P. A.								Clinical review of two fatal equine cases of infection with the insectivorous bat strain of Australian bat lyssavirus								AUSTRALIAN VETERINARY JOURNAL				92	9			324	332		10.1111/avj.12227				SEP 2014	2014	Case series The first two confirmed cases of Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection in horses are presented. Both cases occurred in the same week in May 2013 in paddock mates in southeast Queensland. Australia has been one of only a few countries considered free from rabies-like viruses in domestic animal species. ABLV infection had previously only been confirmed in bats and humans. All three confirmed human cases were fatal, the latest in February 2013. An additional human case of possible abortive infection in 1996 has also been reported. Both equine cases reported here resulted in euthanasia. The risks of infection across other mammalian species are still to be determined.Conclusions These two equine cases highlight that ABLV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in animals with similar clinical presentations in Australia. There is a need for greater awareness regarding the zoonotic risk, use of personal protective equipment, pre-and post-exposure prophylactic measures and laboratory diagnostic options. The authors recommend ABLV testing for all Australian cases of progressive equine neurological disease.																					WOS:000341131200021	25156050

Predicting the Mosquito Species and Vertebrate Species Involved in the Theoretical Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in the United States								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				8	9					e3163	10.1371/journal.pntd.0003163				SEP 2014	2014	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne virus in the family Bunyaviridiae that has spread throughout continental Africa to Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula. The establishment of RVFV in North America would have serious consequences for human and animal health in addition to a significant economic impact on the livestock industry. Published and unpublished data on RVFV vector competence, vertebrate host competence, and mosquito feeding patterns from the United States were combined to quantitatively implicate mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts that may be important to RVFV transmission in the United States. A viremia-vector competence relationship based on published mosquito transmission studies was used to calculate a vertebrate host competence index which was then combined with mosquito blood feeding patterns to approximate the vector and vertebrate amplification fraction, defined as the relative contribution of the mosquito or vertebrate host to pathogen transmission. Results implicate several Aedes spp. mosquitoes and vertebrates in the order Artiodactyla as important hosts for RVFV transmission in the U. S. Moreover, this study identifies critical gaps in knowledge which would be necessary to complete a comprehensive analysis identifying the different contributions of mosquitoes and vertebrates to potential RVFV transmission in the U. S. Future research should focus on (1) the dose-dependent relationship between viremic exposure and the subsequent infectiousness of key mosquito species, (2) evaluation of vertebrate host competence for RVFV among North American mammal species, with particular emphasis on the order Artiodactyla, and (3) identification of areas with a high risk for RVFV introduction so data on local vector and host populations can help generate geographically appropriate amplification fraction estimates.

Whilst numerous pathogens have been discovered in bat species, infection with lyssaviruses is of particular significance from a zoonotic perspective as, where human infection has been reported, it is invariably fatal. Here we review the detection of lyssaviruses within different bat species and overview what is understood regarding their maintenance and transmission following both experimental and natural infection. We discuss the relevance of these pathogens as zoonotic agents and the threat of newly discovered viruses to human populations.																					WOS:000341430400003	25093425

Several studies have suggested that different cellular non canonical proteins or viral proteins can regulate the HCV IRES activity. However, the role of the viral proteins on HCV translation remains controversial. In this report, we confirmed previous studies showing that NS5A down-regulates IRES activity in HepG2 but not in Huh7 cells suggesting that the NS5A effect on HCV IRES is cell-type dependent. Additionally, we provide strong evidence that activated PKR up-regulates the IRES activity while silencing of endogenous PKR had the opposite effect. Furthermore, we present data indicating that the NS5A-mediated inhibitory effect on IRES-dependent translation could be linked with the PKR inactivation. Finally, we show that NS5A from GBV-C but not from GBV-B down-regulates HCV IRES activity in the absence or the presence of PKR over expression. Notably, HCV and GBV-C but not GBV-B NS5A contains a previously identified PKR interacting protein domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

To investigate their epidemiology, persistence and clinical features of infection, large cohorts of horses and other mammalian species were screened for NPHV, EPgV and TDAV viraemia and for past exposure through serological assays for NPHV and EPgV-specific antibodies. NPHV antibodies were detected in 43% of 328 horses screened for antibodies to NS3 and core antibodies, of which three were viraemic by PCR. All five horses that were stablemates of a viraemic horse were seropositive, as was a dog on the same farm. With this single exception, all other species were negative for NPHV antibodies and viraemia: donkeys (n=100), dogs (n=112), cats (n=131), non-human primates (n=164) and humans (n=362). EPgV antibodies to NS3 were detected in 66.5% of horses, including 10 of the 12 horses that had EPgV viraemia. All donkey samples were negative for EPgV antibody and RNA. All horse and donkey samples were negative for TDAV RNA. By comparing viraemia frequencies in horses with and without liver disease, no evidence was obtained that supported an association between active NPHV and EPgV infections with hepatopathy. The study demonstrates that NPHV and EPgV infections are widespread and enzootic in the study horse population and confirms that NPHV and potentially EPgV have higher frequencies of viral clearance than HCV and HPgV infections in humans.

Comparative studies on the genetic, antigenic and pathogenic characteristics of Bokeloh bat lyssavirus								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				95				1647	1653		10.1099/vir.0.065953-0				AUG 2014	2014	Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV), a novel lyssavirus, was isolated from a Natterer's bat (Myotis nattererii), a chiropteran species with a widespread and abundant distribution across Europe. As a novel lyssavirus, the risks of BBLV to animal and human health are unknown and as such characterization both in vitro and in vivo was required to assess pathogenicity and vaccine protection. Full genome sequence analysis and antigenic cartography demonstrated that the German BBLV isolates are most closely related to European bat lyssavirus type 2 (EBLV-2) and Khujand virus and can be characterized within phylogroup I. in vivo characterization demonstrated that BBLV was pathogenic in mice when inoculated peripherally causing clinical signs typical for rabies encephalitis, with higher pathogenicity observed in juvenile mice. A limited vaccination-challenge experiment in mice was conducted and suggested that current vaccines would afford some protection against BBLV although further studies are warranted to determine a serological cut-off for protection.

They are caused by all types of pathogenic agents, including bacteria, parasites, fungi, viruses and prions. Although they have been recognised for many centuries, their impact on public health has increased in the last few decades due to a combination of the success in reducing the spread of human infectious diseases through vaccination and effective therapies and the emergence of novel zoonotic diseases. It is being increasingly recognised that a One Health approach at the human animal ecosystem interface is needed for effective investigation, prevention and control of any emerging zoonotic disease. Here, the authors will review the drivers for emergence, highlight some of the high-impact emerging zoonotic diseases of the last two decades and provide examples of novel One Health approaches for disease investigation, prevention and control. Although this review focuses on emerging zoonotic viral diseases, the authors consider that the discussions presented in this paper will be equally applicable to emerging zoonotic diseases of other pathogen types.

To better understand wildlife rabies and its role in human and livestock rabies, we reviewed what is known about wildlife rabies from the 1990s to 2013 in mainland China. In addition, the genetic diversity and phylogeny of available wildlife-originated rabies viruses (RABVs) were analyzed. Several wildlife species carry rabies including the bat, Chinese ferret badger, raccoon dog, rat, fox, and wolf. RABVs have been isolated or detected in the bat, Chinese ferret badger, raccoon dog, Apodemus, deer, and vole. Among them, the bat, Chinese ferret badger, and raccoon dog may play a role in the ecology of lyssaviruses in mainland China. All wildlife-originated RABVs were found to belong to genotype 1 RABV except for a bat-originated Irkut virus isolated in 2012. Several substitutions were found between the glycoprotein of wildlife-originated RABVs and vaccine strains. Whether these substitutions could affect the efficacy of currently used vaccines against infections caused by these wildlife-originated RABVs needs to be investigated further. Phylogenetic analysis showed that RABVs in the bat, Chinese ferret badger, and raccoon dog were distinct from local dog-originated RABVs, and almost all collected wildlife-originated isolates were associated with older China clades II to V, suggesting the possibility of wildlife reservoirs in mainland China through the ages.

However, in the case of ante-mortem non-neural sample material or decomposed tissues, the FAT reaches its limit, and the use of molecular techniques can be advantageous. In this study, we developed and validated a reverse transcription PCR cascade protocol feasible for the classification of samples, even those for which there is no epidemiological background knowledge. This study emphasises on the most relevant European lyssaviruses.In a first step, two independent N- and L-gene based pan-lyssavirus intercalating dye assays are performed in a double-check application to increase the method's diagnostic safety. For the second step, characterization of the lyssavirus positive samples via two independent multiplex PCR-systems was performed. Both assays were probe-based, species-specific multiplex PCR-systems for Rabies virus, European bat lyssavirus type 1 and 2 as well as Bokeloh bat lyssavirus. All assays were validated successfully with a comprehensive panel of lyssavirus positive samples, as well as negative material from various host species.This double-check strategy allows for both safe and sensitive screening, detection and characterization of all lyssavirus species of humans and animals, as well as the rapid identification of currently unknown lyssaviruses in bats in Europe.

Since 2009, RVFV has been suspected of continuously circulating in the Union of Comoros. To estimate the incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition in the Comorian ruminant population, 191 young goats and cattle were selected in six distinct zones and sampled periodically from April 2010 to August 2011. We found an estimated incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition of 17.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): [8.9-26.1]) with a significant difference between islands (8.2% in Grande Comore, 72.3% in Moheli and 5.8% in Anjouan). Simultaneously, a longitudinal entomological survey was conducted and ruminant trade-related information was collected. No RVFV RNA was detected out of the 1,568 blood-sucking caught insects, including three potential vectors of RVFV mosquito species. Our trade survey suggests that there is a continuous flow of live animals from eastern Africa to the Union of Comoros and movements of ruminants between the three Comoro islands. Finally, a cross-sectional study was performed in August 2011 at the end of the follow-up. We found an estimated RVFV antibody prevalence of 19.3% (95% CI: [15.6%-23.0%]). Our findings suggest a complex RVFV epidemiological cycle in the Union of Comoros with probable inter-islands differences in RVFV circulation patterns. Moheli, and potentially Anjouan, appear to be acting as endemic reservoir of infection whereas RVFV persistence in Grande Comore could be correlated with trade in live animals with the eastern coast of Africa. More data are needed to estimate the real impact of the disease on human health and on the national economy.																					WOS:000340551500069	25078616

We discuss primarily the architecture of these complex membrane rearrangements, because this topic emerged in the last few years as electron tomography has become more widely available. A general denominator is that two. morphotypes. of membrane alterations can be found that are exemplified by flaviviruses and hepaciviruses: membrane invaginations towards the lumen of the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) and double membrane vesicles, representing extrusions also originating from the ER, respectively. We hypothesize that either morphotype might reflect common pathways and principles that are used by these viruses to form their membranous replication compartments.

However, the mechanism by which the virus gains entry to the brain (neuroinvasion) remains poorly understood. Hypotheses of hematogenous and transneural entry have been proposed for WNV neuroinvasion, which revolve mainly around the concepts of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and retrograde axonal transport, respectively. However, an over-representation of in vitro studies without adequate in vivo validation continues to obscure our understanding of the mechanism(s). Furthermore, WNV infection in the current rodent models does not generate a similar viremia and character of CNS infection, as seen in the common target hosts, humans and horses. These differences ultimately question the applicability of rodent models for pathogenesis investigations. Finally, the role of several barriers against CNS insults, such as the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the CSF-brain and the blood-spinal cord barriers, remain largely unexplored, highlighting the infancy of this field. In this review, a systematic and critical appraisal of the current evidence relevant to the possible mechanism(s) of WNV neuroinvasion is conducted.																					WOS:000340038000013	25046180

Therapeutic Treatment of Nipah Virus Infection in Nonhuman Primates with a Neutralizing Human Monoclonal Antibody								SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				6	242					242ra82	10.1126/scitranslmed.3008929				JUN 25 2014	2014	Nipah virus (NiV) is an emerging zoonotic paramyxovirus that causes severe and often fatal disease in pigs and humans. There are currently no vaccines or treatments approved for human use. Studies in small-animal models of NiV infection suggest that antibody therapy may be a promising treatment. However, most studies have assessed treatment at times shortly after virus exposure before animals show signs of disease. We assessed the efficacy of a fully human monoclonal antibody, m102.4, at several time points after virus exposure including at the onset of clinical illness in a uniformly lethal nonhuman primate model of NiV disease. Sixteen African green monkeys (AGMs) were challenged intratracheally with a lethal dose of NiV, and 12 animals were infused twice with m102.4 (15 mg/kg) beginning at either 1, 3, or 5 days after virus challenge and again about 2 days later. The presence of viral RNA, infectious virus, and/or NiV-specific immune responses demonstrated that all subjects were infected after challenge. All 12 AGMs that received m102.4 survived infection, whereas the untreated control subjects succumbed to disease between days 8 and 10 after infection. AGMs in the day 5 treatment group exhibited clinical signs of disease, but all animals recovered by day 16. These results represent the successful therapeutic in vivo efficacy by an investigational drug against NiV in a nonhuman primate and highlight the potential impact that a monoclonal antibody can have on a highly pathogenic zoonotic human disease.

We have designated these viruses SPgV(krc), SPgV(krtg) and SPgV(kbab), reflecting their host species' common names, which include reference to their location of origin in Kibale National Park, Uganda. SPgV(krc) and SPgV(krtg) were detected in 47% (28/60) of red colobus and 42% (5/12) red-tailed guenons, respectively, while SPgV(kbab) infection was observed in 1 of 23 olive baboons tested. Infections were not associated with any apparent disease, despite the generally high viral loads observed for each variant. These viruses were monophyletic and equally divergent from HPgV and pegiviruses previously identified in chimpanzees (SPgV(cpz)). Overall, the high degree of conservation of genetic features among the novel SPgVs, HPgV and SPgV(cpz) suggests conservation of function among these closely related viruses. Our study describes the first primate pegiviruses detected in Old World monkeys, expanding the known genetic diversity and host range of pegiviruses and providing insight into the natural history of this genus.

In this retrospective study, data on bats submitted for rabies testing were analysed in order to better understand the epidemiology of EBLV-1 in bats in France and to investigate some epidemiological trends. Of the 3176 bats submitted for rabies diagnosis from 1989 to 2013, 1.96% (48/2447 analysed) were diagnosed positive. Among the twelve recognised virus species within the Lyssavirus genus, two species were isolated in France. 47 positive bats were morphologically identified as Eptesicus serotinus and were shown to be infected by both the EBLV-1a and the EBLV-1b lineages. Isolation of BBLV in Myotis nattereri was reported once in the north-east of France in 2012. The phylogenetic characterisation of all 47 French EBLV-1 isolates sampled between 1989 and 2013 and the French BBLV sample against 21 referenced partial nucleoprotein sequences confirmed the low genetic diversity of EBLV-1 despite its extensive geographical range. Statistical analysis performed on the serotine bat data collected from 1989 to 2013 showed seasonal variation of rabies occurrence with a significantly higher proportion of positive samples detected during the autumn compared to the spring and the summer period (34% of positive bats detected in autumn, 15% in summer, 13% in spring and 12% in winter). In this study, we have provided the details of the geographical distribution of EBLV-1a in the south-west of France and the north-south division of EBLV-1b with its subdivisions into three phylogenetic groups: group B1 in the north-west, group B2 in the centre and group B3 in the north-east of France.

Human pegivirus RNA is found in multiple blood mononuclear cells in vivo and serum-derived viral RNA-containing particles are infectious in vitro								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				95				1307	1319		10.1099/vir.0.063016-0				JUN 2014	2014	Human pegivirus (HPgV; previously called GB virus C/hepatitis G virus) has limited pathogenicity, despite causing persistent infection, and is associated with prolonged survival in human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals. Although HPgV RNA is found in and produced by T- and B-lymphocytes, the primary permissive cell type(s) are unknown. We quantified HPgV RNA in highly purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cells, including naive, central memory and effector memory populations, and in B-cells (CD19(+)), NK cells (CD56(+)) and monocytes (CD14(+)) using real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Single-genome sequencing was performed on viruses within individual cell types to estimate genetic diversity among cell populations. HPgV RNA was present in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocytes (nine of nine subjects), B-lymphocytes (seven of ten subjects), NK cells and monocytes (both four of five). HPgV RNA levels were higher in naive (CD45RA(+)) CD4(+) cells than in central memory and effector memory cells (P<0.01). HPgV sequences were highly conserved among subjects (0.117 +/- 0.02 substitutions per site; range 0.58-0.14) and within subjects (0.006 +/- 0.003 substitutions per site; range 0.006-0.010). The non-synonymous/synonymous substitution ratio was 0.07, suggesting a low selective pressure. Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labelled HPgV RNA-containing particles precipitated by a commercial exosome isolation reagent delivered CSFE to uninfected monocytes, NK cells and T- and B-lymphocytes, and HPgV RNA was transferred to PBMCs with evidence of subsequent virus replication. Thus, HPgV RNA-containing serum particles including microvesicles may contribute to delivery of HPgV to PBMCs in vivo, explaining the apparent broad tropism of this persistent human RNA virus.

J	Galli, Andrea; Bukh, Jens								Comparative analysis of the molecular mechanisms of recombination in hepatitis C virus								TRENDS IN MICROBIOLOGY				22	6			354	364		10.1016/j.tim.2014.02.005				JUN 2014	2014	Genetic recombination is an important evolutionary mechanism for RNA viruses. The significance of this phenomenon for hepatitis C virus (HCV) has recently become evident, with the identification of circulating recombinant forms in HCV-infected individuals and by novel data from studies permitted by advances in HCV cell culture systems and genotyping protocols. HCV is readily able to produce viable recombinants, using replicative and non-replicative molecular mechanisms. However, our knowledge of the required molecular mechanisms remains limited. Understanding how HCV recombines might be instrumental for a better monitoring of global epidemiology, to clarify the virus evolution, and evaluate the impact of recombinant forms on the efficacy of oncoming combination drug therapies. For the latter, frequency and location of recombination events could affect the efficacy of multidrug regimens. This review will focus on current data available on HCV recombination, also in relation to more detailed data from other RNA viruses.																					WOS:000337873500009	24636243

Twenty years of active bat rabies surveillance in Germany: a detailed analysis and future perspectives								EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION				142	6			1155	1166		10.1017/S0950268813002185				JUN 2014	2014	In Germany, active bat rabies surveillance was conducted between 1993 and 2012. A total of 4546 oropharyngeal swab samples from 18 bat species were screened for the presence of EBLV-1- , EBLV-2- and BBLV-specific RNA. Overall, 0 center dot 15% of oropharyngeal swab samples tested EBLV-1 positive, with the majority originating from Eptesicus serotinus. Interestingly, out of seven RT-PCR-positive oropharyngeal swabs subjected to virus isolation, viable virus was isolated from a single serotine bat (E. serotinus). Additionally, about 1226 blood samples were tested serologically, and varying virus neutralizing antibody titres were found in at least eight different bat species. The detection of viral RNA and seroconversion in repeatedly sampled serotine bats indicates long-term circulation of the virus in a particular bat colony. The limitations of random-based active bat rabies surveillance over passive bat rabies surveillance and its possible application of targeted approaches for future research activities on bat lyssavirus dynamics and maintenance are discussed.

Human pegivirus (GB virus C) NS3 protease activity inhibits induction of the type I interferon response and is not inhibited by HCV NS3 protease inhibitors								VIROLOGY				456				300	309		10.1016/j.virol.2014.03.018				MAY 2014	2014	We previously found that human pegivirus (HPgV; formerly GBV-C) NS3 protease activity inhibits Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) replication in a CD4+ T cell line. Given the protease's similarity to the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease, we characterized HPgV protease activity and asked whether it affects the type I interferon response or is inhibited by HCV protease antagonists. We characterized the activity of proteases with mutations in the catalytic triad and demonstrated that the HCV protease inhibitors Telaprevir, Boceprevir, and Danoprevir do not affect HPgV protease activity. HPgV NS3 protease cleaved MAVS but not TRIF, and it inhibited interferon responses sufficiently to enhance growth of an interferon-sensitive virus. Therefore, HPgV's inhibition of the interferon response could help promote HPgV persistence, which is associated with clinical benefits in HIV-infected patients. Our results also imply that HCV protease inhibitors should not interfere with the beneficial effects of HPgV in HPgV/HCV/HIV infected patients. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Antigenic and genetic characterization of a divergent African virus, Ikoma lyssavirus								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				95				1025	1032		10.1099/vir.0.061952-0				MAY 2014	2014	In 2009, a novel lyssavirus (subsequently named Ikoma lyssavirus, IKOV) was detected in the brain of an African civet (Civettictis civetta) with clinical rabies in the Serengeti National Park of Tanzania. The degree of nucleotide divergence between the genome of IKOV and those of other lyssaviruses predicted antigenic distinction from, and lack of protection provided by, available rabies vaccines. In addition, the index case was considered likely to be an incidental spillover event, and therefore the true reservoir of IKOV remained to be identified. The advent of sensitive molecular techniques has led to a rapid increase in the discovery of novel viruses. Detecting viral sequence alone, however, only allows for prediction of phenotypic characteristics and not their measurement. In the present study we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of IKOV, demonstrating that it is (1) pathogenic by peripheral inoculation in an animal model, (2) antigenically distinct from current rabies vaccine strains and (3) poorly neutralized by sera from humans and animals immunized against rabies. In a laboratory mouse model, no protection was elicited by a licensed rabies vaccine. We also investigated the role of bats as reservoirs of IKOV. We found no evidence for infection among 483 individuals of at least 13 bat species sampled across sites in the Serengeti and Southern Kenya.																					WOS:000338177900004	24496827	
J	Johnson, Nicholas; Arechiga-Ceballos, Nidia; Aguilar-Setien, Alvaro								Vampire Bat Rabies: Ecology, Epidemiology and Control								VIRUSES-BASEL				6	5			1911	1928		10.3390/v6051911				MAY 2014	2014	Extensive surveillance in bat populations in response to recent emerging diseases has revealed that this group of mammals acts as a reservoir for a large range of viruses. However, the oldest known association between a zoonotic virus and a bat is that between rabies virus and the vampire bat. Vampire bats are only found in Latin America and their unique method of obtaining nutrition, blood-feeding or haematophagy, has only evolved in the New World. The adaptations that enable blood-feeding also make the vampire bat highly effective at transmitting rabies virus. Whether the virus was present in pre-Columbian America or was introduced is much disputed, however, the introduction of Old World livestock and associated landscape modification, which continues to the present day, has enabled vampire bat populations to increase. This in turn has provided the conditions for rabies re-emergence to threaten both livestock and human populations as vampire bats target large mammals. This review considers the ecology of the vampire bat that make it such an efficient vector for rabies, the current status of vampire-transmitted rabies and the future prospects for spread by this virus and its control.

In Europe, Eptesicus serotinus is the most frequently reported bat species infected with Lyssavirus, and thus considered to be the reservoir of European bat Lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1). To date, the role of other bat species in EBLV-1 epidemiology and persistence remains unknown. Here, we built an EBLV-12transmission model based on local observations of a three-cave and four-bat species (Myotis capaccinii, Myotis myotis, Miniopterus schreibersii, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) system in the Balearic Islands, for which a 1995-2011 serological dataset indicated the continuous presence of EBLV-1. Eptesicus serotinus was never observed in the system during the 16-year follow-up and therefore was not included in the model. We used the model to explore virus persistence mechanisms and to assess the importance of each bat species in the transmission dynamics. We found that EBLV-1 could not be sustained if transmission between M. schreibersii and other bat species was eliminated, suggesting that this species serves as a regional reservoir. Global sensitivity analysis using Sobol's method revealed that following the rate of autumn-winter infectious contacts, M. schreibersii's incubation-and immune-period durations, but not the infectious period length, were the most relevant factors driving virus persistence.

Access to molecular diagnostics, pre- and post-mortem, and documentation of pathophysiological responses while using the Milwaukee protocol, can add useful insights for the future of rabies management.Case presentation: A 58-year-old British Asian woman was referred to a regional general hospital in the UK with hydrophobia, anxiety and confusion nine weeks after receiving a dog bite in North West India. Nuchal skin biopsy, saliva, and a skin biopsy from the site of the dog bite wound, taken on the day of admission, all demonstrated the presence of rabies virus RNA. Within 48 hours sequence analysis of viral RNA confirmed the diagnosis and demonstrated that the virus was a strain closely related to canine rabies viruses circulating in South Asia. Her condition deteriorated rapidly with increased agitation and autonomic dysfunction. She was heavily sedated and intubated on the day after admission, treated according to a modified Milwaukee protocol, and remained stable until she developed heart block and profound acidosis and died on the eighth day. Analysis of autopsy samples showed a complete absence of rabies neutralizing antibody in cerebrospinal fluid and serum, and corresponding high levels of virus antigen and nucleic acid in brain and cerebrospinal fluid. Quantitative PCR showed virus was also distributed widely in peripheral tissues despite mild or undetectable histopathological changes. Vagus nerve branches in the heart showed neuritis, a probable Negri body but no demonstrable rabies antigen.Conclusion: Rapid molecular diagnosis and strain typing is helpful in the management of human rabies infection. Post-mortem findings such as vagal neuritis highlight clinically important effects on the cardiovascular system which are typical for the clinical course of rabies in humans. Management guided by the Milwaukee protocol is feasible within well-resourced intensive care units, but its role in improving outcome for canine-derived rabies remains theoretical.

The lack of human vaccine or specific treatment against WNV infection imparts a pressing need to characterize indicators associated with neurological involvement. By its intimacy with central nervous system (CNS) structures, modifications in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition could accurately reflect CNS pathological process. Until now, few studies investigated the association between imbalance of CSF elements and severity of WNV infection. The aim of the present study was to apply the iTRAQ technology in order to identify the CSF proteins whose abundances are modified in patients with WNND. Forty-seven proteins were found modified in the CSF of WNND patients as compared to control groups, and most of them are reported for the first time in the context of WNND. On the basis of their known biological functions, several of these proteins were associated with inflammatory response. Among them, Defensin-1 alpha (DEFA1), a protein reported with anti-viral effects, presented the highest increasing fold-change (FC>12). The augmentation of DEFA1 abundance in patients with WNND was confirmed at the CSF, but also in serum, compared to the control individual groups. Furthermore, the DEFA1 serum level was significantly elevated in WNND patients compared to subjects diagnosed for WNF. The present study provided the first insight into the potential CSF biomarkers associated with WNV neuroinvasion. Further investigation in larger cohorts with kinetic sampling could determine the usefulness of measuring DEFA1 as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker of detrimental WNND evolution.

Filoviruses in Bats: Current Knowledge and Future Directions								VIRUSES-BASEL				6	4			1759	1788		10.3390/v6041759				APR 2014	2014	Filoviruses, including Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus, pose significant threats to public health and species conservation by causing hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with high mortality rates. Since the first outbreak in 1967, their origins, natural history, and ecology remained elusive until recent studies linked them through molecular, serological, and virological studies to bats. We review the ecology, epidemiology, and natural history of these systems, drawing on examples from other bat-borne zoonoses, and highlight key areas for future research. We compare and contrast results from ecological and virological studies of bats and filoviruses with those of other systems. We also highlight how advanced methods, such as more recent serological assays, can be interlinked with flexible statistical methods and experimental studies to inform the field studies necessary to understand filovirus persistence in wildlife populations and cross-species transmission leading to outbreaks. We highlight the need for a more unified, global surveillance strategy for filoviruses in wildlife, and advocate for more integrated, multi-disciplinary approaches to understand dynamics in bat populations to ultimately mitigate or prevent potentially devastating disease outbreaks.

Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus. Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen.																					WOS:000339237600001	26038514	
J	Del Amo, Javier; Llorente, Francisco; Figuerola, Jordi; Soriguer, Ramon C.; Moreno, Ana M.; Cordioli, Paolo; Weissenboeck, Herbert; Angel Jimenez-Clavero, Miguel								Experimental infection of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) with West Nile virus isolates of Euro-Mediterranean and North American origins								VETERINARY RESEARCH				45						33	10.1186/1297-9716-45-33				MAR 19 2014	2014	West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic arboviral pathogen transmitted by mosquitoes in a cycle involving wild birds as reservoir hosts. The virus has recently emerged in North America and re-emerged in Europe. North American WNV outbreaks are often accompanied by high mortality in wild birds, a feature that is uncommon in Europe. The reason for this difference is unknown, but the intrinsic virulence of the viruses circulating in each continent and/or the susceptibility to the disease of Palearctic as opposed to Nearctic wild bird species could play a role. To assess this question, experimental inoculations with four lineage 1 WNV strains, three from southern Europe (Italy/2008, Italy/2009 and Spain/2007) and one from North America (NY99) were performed on house sparrows (Passer domesticus), a wild passerine common in both continents. Non-significant differences which ranged from 0% to 25% were observed in mortality for the different WNV strains. Viremias lasted from 1 to 5-6 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all cases; individuals inoculated with NY99 had significantly higher titres than those inoculated with any of the Euro-Mediterranean strains. Remarkably, host competence was found to be higher for NY99 than for the other strains. Consequently, albeit being pathogenic for house sparrows, some Euro-Mediterranean strains had reduced capacity for replication in -and transmission from-this host, as compared to the NY99 strain. If applicable also to other wild bird host species, this relatively reduced transmission capacity of the Euro-Mediterranean strains could explain the lower incidence of this disease in wild birds in the Euro-Mediterranean area.

J	Banyard, Ashley C.; Healy, Derek M.; Brookes, Sharon M.; Voller, Katja; Hicks, Daniel J.; Nunez, Alejandro; Fooks, Anthony R.								Lyssavirus infection: 'Low dose, multiple exposure' in the mouse model								VIRUS RESEARCH				181				35	42		10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.029				MAR 6 2014	2014	The European bat lyssaviruses (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2) are zoonotic pathogens present within bat populations across Europe. The maintenance and transmission of lyssaviruses within bat colonies is poorly understood. Cases of repeated isolation of lyssaviruses from bat roosts have raised questions regarding the maintenance and intraspecies transmissibility of these viruses within colonies. Furthermore, the significance of seropositive bats in colonies remains unclear. Due to the protected nature of European bat species, and hence restrictions to working with the natural host for lyssaviruses, this study analysed the outcome following repeat inoculation of low doses of lyssaviruses in a murine model. A standardized dose of virus, EBLV-1, EBLV-2 or a 'street strain' of rabies (RABV), was administered via a peripheral route to attempt to mimic what is hypothesized as natural infection. Each mouse (n = 10/virus/group/dilution) received four inoculations, two doses in each footpad over a period of four months, alternating footpad with each inoculation. Mice were tail bled between inoculations to evaluate antibody responses to infection. Mice succumbed to infection after each inoculation with 26.6% of mice developing clinical disease following the initial exposure across all dilutions (RABV, 32.5% (n = 13/40); EBLV-1, 35% (n = 13/40); EBLV-2, 12.5% (n = 5/40)). Interestingly, the lowest dose caused clinical disease in some mice upon first exposure ((RABV, 20% (n = 2/10) after first inoculation; RABV, 12.5% (n = 1/8) after second inoculation; EBLV-2, 10% (n = 1/10) after primary inoculation). Furthermore, five mice developed clinical disease following the second exposure to live virus (RABV, n = 1; EBLV-1, n = 1; EBLV-2, n = 3) although histopathological examination indicated that the primary inoculation was the most probably cause of death due to levels of inflammation and virus antigen distribution observed. All the remaining mice (RABV, n = 26; EBLV-1, n = 26; EBLV-2, n = 29) survived the tertiary and quaternary inoculations although the serological response did not necessarily reflect the repeated exposure. We conclude that despite repeated exposure, neither clinical disease nor serological response can be predicted and that further studies are required to understand the mechanisms behind survival following multiple exposures to lyssaviruses.

Plasma samples were tested for GBV-C RNA with primers to the 5'untranslated region gene. HIV and HCV viral load, CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell count, and the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were tested in all patients.Results: GBV-C RNA was identified in 34 (32.38%) of the patients with HIV/HCV coinfection, and in 24 (33.33%) of the patients with HCV mono-infection. GBV-C infection was associated with significantly lower ALT and AST levels in patients with chronic hepatitis C and HIV coinfection, but not in those HCV mono-infections. The presence of GBV-C infection was not correlated with CD4(+) and CD8(+) cell count, gender, age, HIV load, HCV load, and HCV genotype.Conclusions: This study found that GBV-C infection has a high frequency among injecting drug users with HIV/HCV coinfection and HCV mono-infection in Yunnan, China.

For example, Hendra virus.(HeV), a zoonotic paramyxovirus, was discovered in 1994, and since then, infections have occurred in 7 humans, each of whom had a strong epidemiologic link to similarly affected horses. As a consequence of these outbreaks, eradication of bat populations was discussed, despite their crucial environmental roles in pollination and reduction of the insect population. We describe the development and evaluation of a vaccine for horses with the potential for breaking the chain of HeV transmission from bats to horses to humans, thereby protecting horse, human, and environmental health. The HeV vaccine for horses is a key example of a One Health approach to the control of human disease.																					WOS:000332433900004	24572697	
J	Vieyres, Gabrielle; Dubuisson, Jean; Pietschmann, Thomas								Incorporation of Hepatitis C Virus E1 and E2 Glycoproteins: The Keystones on a Peculiar Virion								VIRUSES-BASEL				6	3			1149	1187		10.3390/v6031149				MAR 2014	2014	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) encodes two envelope glycoproteins, E1 and E2. Their structure and mode of fusion remain unknown, and so does the virion architecture. The organization of the HCV envelope shell in particular is subject to discussion as it incorporates or associates with host-derived lipoproteins, to an extent that the biophysical properties of the virion resemble more very-low-density lipoproteins than of any virus known so far. The recent development of novel cell culture systems for HCV has provided new insights on the assembly of this atypical viral particle. Hence, the extensive E1E2 characterization accomplished for the last two decades in heterologous expression systems can now be brought into the context of a productive HCV infection. This review describes the biogenesis and maturation of HCV envelope glycoproteins, as well as the interplay between viral and host factors required for their incorporation in the viral envelope, in a way that allows efficient entry into target cells and evasion of the host immune response.

J	Perez-Ramirez, Elisa; Llorente, Francisco; Angel Jimenez-Clavero, Miguel								Experimental Infections of Wild Birds with West Nile Virus								VIRUSES-BASEL				6	2			752	781		10.3390/v6020752				FEB 2014	2014	Avian models of West Nile virus (WNV) disease have become pivotal in the study of infection pathogenesis and transmission, despite the intrinsic constraints that represents this type of experimental research that needs to be conducted in biosecurity level 3 (BSL3) facilities. This review summarizes the main achievements of WNV experimental research carried out in wild birds, highlighting advantages and limitations of this model. Viral and host factors that determine the infection outcome are analyzed in detail, as well as recent discoveries about avian immunity, viral transmission, and persistence achieved through experimental research. Studies of laboratory infections in the natural host will help to understand variations in susceptibility and reservoir competence among bird species, as well as in the epidemiological patterns found in different affected areas.

Noncoding Subgenomic Flavivirus RNA: Multiple Functions in West Nile Virus Pathogenesis and Modulation of Host Responses								VIRUSES-BASEL				6	2			404	427		10.3390/v6020404				FEB 2014	2014	Flaviviruses are a large group of positive strand RNA viruses transmitted by arthropods that include many human pathogens such as West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus, dengue virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. All members in this genus tested so far are shown to produce a unique subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) derived from the 3' untranslated region (UTR). sfRNA is a product of incomplete degradation of genomic RNA by the cell 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRN1 which stalls at highly ordered secondary RNA structures at the beginning of the 3'UTR. Generation of sfRNA results in inhibition of XRN1 activity leading to an increase in stability of many cellular mRNAs. Mutant WNV deficient in sfRNA generation was highly attenuated displaying a marked decrease in cytopathicity in cells and pathogenicity in mice. sfRNA has also been shown to inhibit the antiviral activity of IFN-/ by yet unknown mechanism and of the RNAi pathway by likely serving as a decoy substrate for Dicer. Thus, sfRNA is involved in modulating multiple cellular pathways to facilitate viral pathogenicity; however the overlying mechanism linking all these multiple functions of sfRNA remains to be elucidated.

Recent Observations on Australian Bat Lyssavirus Tropism and Viral Entry								VIRUSES-BASEL				6	2			909	926		10.3390/v6020909				FEB 2014	2014	Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) is a recently emerged rhabdovirus of the genus lyssavirus considered endemic in Australian bat populations that causes a neurological disease in people indistinguishable from clinical rabies. There are two distinct variants of ABLV, one that circulates in frugivorous bats (genus Pteropus) and the other in insectivorous microbats (genus Saccolaimus). Three fatal human cases of ABLV infection have been reported, the most recent in 2013, and each manifested as acute encephalitis but with variable incubation periods. Importantly, two equine cases also arose recently in 2013, the first occurrence of ABLV in a species other than bats or humans. Similar to other rhabdoviruses, ABLV infects host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis and subsequent pH-dependent fusion facilitated by its single fusogenic envelope glycoprotein (G). Recent studies have revealed that proposed rabies virus (RABV) receptors are not sufficient to permit ABLV entry into host cells and that the unknown receptor is broadly conserved among mammalian species. However, despite clear tropism differences between ABLV and RABV, the two viruses appear to utilize similar endocytic entry pathways. The recent human and horse infections highlight the importance of continued Australian public health awareness of this emerging pathogen.																					WOS:000335748500014	24556791
