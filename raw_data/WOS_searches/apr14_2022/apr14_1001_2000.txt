Rhinovirus-induced CCL17 and CCL22 in Asthma Exacerbations and Differential Regulation by STAT6								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				64	3			344	356		10.1165/rcmb.2020-0011OC				MAR 2021	2021	The interplay of type-2 inflammation and antiviral immunity underpins asthma exacerbation pathogenesis. Virus infection induces type-2 inflammation-promoting chemokines CCL17 and CCL22 in asthma; however, mechanisms regulating induction are poorly understood. By using a human rhinovirus (RV) challenge model in human airway epithelial cells in vitro and mice in vivo, we assessed mechanisms regulating CCL17 and CCL22 expression. Subjects with mild to moderate asthma and healthy volunteers were experimentally infected with RV and airway CCL17 and CCL22 protein quantified. In vitro airway epithelial cell- and mouse-RV infection models were then used to define STAT6- and NF-kBmediated regulation of CCL17 and CCL22 expression. Following RV infection, CCL17 and CCL22 expression was higher in asthma, which differentially correlated with clinical and immunological parameters. Air-liquid interface-differentiated primary epithelial cells from donors with asthma also expressed higher levels of RV-induced CCL22. RV infection boosted type-2 cytokine-induced STAT6 activation. In epithelial cells, type-2 cytokines and STAT6 activation had differential effects on chemokine expression, increasing CCL17 and suppressing CCL22, whereas NF-kappa B promoted expression of both chemokines. In mice, RV infection activated pulmonary STAT6, which was required for CCL17 but not CCL22 expression. STAT6-knockout mice infected with RV expressed increased levels of NF-kappa B-regulated chemokines, which was associated with rapid viral clearance. Therefore, RV-induced upregulation of CCL17 and CCL22 was mediated by NF-kappa B activation, whereas expression was differentially regulated by STAT6. Together, these findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of type-2 STAT6 activation alone will not block all inflammatory pathways during RV infection in asthma.

J	Haist, Kelsey C.; Carpentier, Kathryn S.; Davenport, Bennett J.; Morrison, Thomas E.								Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Mediate Control of Ross River Virus Infection via a Type I Interferon-Dependent, MAVS-Independent Mechanism								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				95	6					e01538-20	10.1128/JVI.01538-20				MAR 2021	2021	Ross River virus (RRV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes epidemics of debilitating musculoskeletal disease. To define the innate immune mechanisms that mediate control of RRV infection, we studied a RRV strain encoding 6 nonsynonymous mutations in nsP1 (RRV-T48-nsP1(6M)) that is attenuated in wild-type (WT) mice and Rag1(-/-) mice, which are unable to mount adaptive immune responses, but not in mice that lack the capacity to respond to type I interferon (IFN) (Ifnar1(-/-) mice). Utilizing this attenuated strain, our prior studies revealed that mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS)-dependent production of type I IFN by Ly6C(hi) monocytes is critical for control of acute RRV infection. Here, we infected Mavs(-/-) mice with either WT RRV or RRV-T48-nsP1(6M) to elucidate MAVS-independent protective mechanisms. Mavs-/mice infected with WT RRV developed severe disease and succumbed to infection, whereas those infected with RRV-T48-nsP1(6M) exhibited minimal disease signs. Mavs(-/-) mice infected with RRV-T48-nsP1(6M) had higher levels of systemic type I IFN than Mavs(-/-) mice infected with WT virus, and treatment of Mavs-/mice infected with the attenuated nsP1 mutant virus with an IFNAR1-blocking antibody resulted in a lethal infection. In vitro, type I IFN expression was induced in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) cocultured with RRV-infected cells in a MAVS-independent manner, and depletion of pDCs in Mavs(-/-) mice resulted in increased viral burdens in joint and muscle tissues, suggesting that pDCs are a source of the protective IFN in Mavs(-/-) mice. These data suggest that pDC production of type I IFN through a MAVS-independent pathway contributes to control of RRV infection.IMPORTANCE Arthritogenic alphaviruses, including Ross River virus (RRV), are human pathogens that cause debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease and are a significant public health burden. Using an attenuated RRV with enhanced susceptibility to host innate immune responses has revealed key cellular and molecular mechanisms that can mediate control of attenuated RRV infection and that are evaded by more virulent RRV strains. In this study, we found that pDCs contribute to the protective type I interferon response during RRV infection through a mechanism that is independent of the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) adaptor protein. These findings highlight a key innate immune mechanism that contributes to control of alphavirus infections.																					WOS:000623419300010	33361425

Rta, encoded by gene 50, serves as the major transactivator of the lytic program and is highly conserved among all the gammaherpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gamma HV68). Introduction of a translation stop codon in gamma HV68 gene 50 (gene 50.stop gamma HV68) demonstrated that Rta is essential for virus replication in vitro. To investigate the role that virus replication plays in the establishment and maintenance of latency, we infected mice with gene 50.stop gamma HV68. Notably, the gene 50.stop virus established a long-term infection in lung B cells following intranasal infection of mice but was unable to establish latency in the spleen. This complete block in the establishment of latency in the spleen was also seen when lytic virus production was inhibited by treating mice infected with wild-type virus with the antiviral drug cidofovir, implicating virus replication and not an independent function of Rta in the establishment of splenic latency. Furthermore, we showed that gene 50.stop gamma HV68 was unable to prime the immune system and was unable to protect against a challenge with wild-type gamma RV68, despite its ability to chronically infect lung B cells. These data indicate gammaherpesviruses that are unable to undergo lytic replication in vivo may not be viable vaccine candidates despite the detection of cells harboring viral genome at late times postinfection.

The minerals possess a number of beneficial activities, especially in regulating the immune system. The aims of the present study were to evaluate immune enhancing effects of dietary aluminosilicate supplement (DAS) in mice, and to demonstrate clearance effects of DAS against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of an antibiotic substitute for use in pigs. Relative messenger RNA expression levels of interferon-gamma, interleukin-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, phagocytic activities of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, serum antibody production level and spleen B cell ratio were significantly increased in the DAS groups of mice compared with the control group (each feeding group had three replications with 5 mice each). The results indicated that general immune activity including cellular and humoral immunity could be enhanced by DAS in mice. In experimentally PCV2-infected pigs, the load of viral genome in nasal swab, serum and lung of the DAS group of pigs was significantly decreased compared with the control group at 28 days post-infection (each group three pigs). Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that pigs in the DAS group displayed mild and less severe abnormal changes compared with the control group, indicating that DAS reinforces clearance of PCV2 in experimentally infected pigs. This may relate to general immune enhancing effects of DAS in mice. Therefore DAS will help the health of animal, especially in swine. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tissue tropisms, infection kinetics, histologic lesions, and antibody response of the MR766 strain of Zika virus in a murine model								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				14						82	10.1186/s12985-017-0749-x				APR 18 2017	2017	Background: The appearance of severe Zika virus (ZIKV) disease in the most recent outbreak has prompted researchers to respond through the development of tools to quickly characterize transmission and pathology. We describe here another such tool, a mouse model of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis using the MR766 strain of virus that adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding ZIKV kinetics in small animal models.Methods: We infected mice with the MR766 strain of ZIKV to determine infection kinetics via serum viremia. We further evaluated infection-induced lesions via histopathology and visualized viral antigen via immunohistochemical labeling. We also investigated the antibody response of recovered animals to both the MR766 and a strain from the current outbreak (PRVABC59).Results: We demonstrate that the IRF3/7 DKO mouse is a susceptible, mostly non-lethal model well suited for the study of infection kinetics, pathological progression, and antibody response. Infected mice presented lesions in tissues that have been associated with ZIKV infection in the human population, such as the eyes, male gonads, and central nervous system. In addition, we demonstrate that infection with the MR766 strain produces cross-neutralizing antibodies to the PRVABC59 strain of the Asian lineage.Conclusions: This model provides an additional tool for future studies into the transmission routes of ZIKV, as well as for the development of antivirals and other therapeutics, and should be included in the growing list of available tools for investigations of ZIKV infection and pathogenesis.

Expression of the purine biosynthetic enzyme phosphoribosyl formylglycinamidine synthase in neurons								JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY				144	6			723	735		10.1111/jnc.14304				MAR 2018	2018	Purines are metabolic building blocks essential for all living organisms on earth. De novo purine biosynthesis occurs in the brain and appears to play important roles in neural development. Phosphoribosyl formylglycinamidine synthase (FGAMS, also known as PFAS or FGARAT), a core enzyme involved in the de novo synthesis of purines, may play alternative roles in viral pathogenesis. To date, no thorough investigation of the endogenous expression and localization of de novo purine biosynthetic enzymes has been conducted in human neurons or in virally infected cells. In this study, we characterized expression of FGAMS using multiple neuronal models. In differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, primary rat hippocampal neurons, and in whole-mouse brain sections, FGAMS immunoreactivity was distributed within the neuronal cytoplasm. FGAMS immunolabeling invitro demonstrated extensive distribution throughout neuronal processes. To investigate potential changes in FGAMS expression and localization following viral infection, we infected cells with the human pathogen herpes simplex virus 1. In infected fibroblasts, FGAMS immunolabeling shifted from a diffuse cytoplasmic location to a mainly perinuclear localization by 12h post-infection. In contrast, in infected neurons, FGAMS localization showed no discernable changes in the localization of FGAMS immunoreactivity. There were no changes in total FGAMS protein levels in either cell type. Together, these data provide insight into potential purine biosynthetic mechanisms utilized within neurons during homeostasis as well as viral infection.

It is caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) and transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. Since 1998, BT has been emerging throughout Europe, threatening not only the naive ruminant population. Historically, South American camelids (SAC) were considered to be resistant to BT disease. However, recent fatalities related to BTV in captive SAC have raised questions about their role in BTV epidemiology.Data on the susceptibility of SAC to experimental infection with BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) were collected in an animal experiment. Three alpacas (Vicugna pacos) and three llamas (Lama glama) were experimentally infected with BTV-8. They displayed very mild clinical signs. Seroconversion was first measured 6-8 days after infection (dpi) by ELISA, and neutralising antibodies appeared 10-13 dpi. BTV-8 RNA levels in blood were very low, and quickly cleared after seroconversion. However, spleens collected post-mortem were still positive for BTV RNA, over 71 days after the last detection in blood samples. Virus isolation was only possible from blood samples of two alpacas by inoculation of highly sensitive interferon alpha/beta receptor-deficient (IFNAR(-/-)) mice.An in vitro experiment demonstrated that significantly lower amounts of BTV-8 adsorb to SAC blood cells than to bovine blood cells.Although this experiment showed that SAC are generally susceptible to a BTV-8 infection, it indicates that these species play a negligible role in BTV epidemiology.

At 6 and 9 days post-infection, motor incoordination and posterior limb paralysis were observed with focal necrosis, apoptotic cells, perivascular inflammatory cuffing and astrocytosis, mainly in the cortex and hippocampus. Expression of dengue virus genome and mRNA encoding for TNF-alpha, IL-1alpha IL-2, IL-6, IL-1beta, IL-12p40, IFNalpha, and IFNbeta; in addition host survival and inflammatory response genes MAC-1, EB22, GFAP, ICAM-1 and A20, were increased, suggesting that experimental dengue encephalitis could be associated with virus replication, inflammatory cytokine production or both. Similar findings have been observed in human dengue virus infection. Therefore, our results can be useful to elucidate and support the physiopathology of the disease.

The viral and host cellular factors that contribute to RVFV virulence and pathogenicity are still poorly understood. All pathogenic RVFV strains direct the synthesis of a nonstructural phosphoprotein (NSs) that is encoded by the smallest (S) segment of the tripartite genome and has an undefined accessory function. In this report, we show that MP12 and clone 13, two attenuated RVFV strains with mutations in the NSs gene, were highly virulent in IFNAR(-/-) mice lacking the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptor but remained attenuated in IFN-gamma receptor-deficient mice. Both attenuated strains proved to be excellent inducers of early IFN-alpha/beta production. In contrast, the virulent strain ZH548 failed to induce detectable amounts of IFN-alpha/beta and replicated extensively in both IFN-competent and IFN-deficient mice. Clone 13 has a defective NSs gene with a large in-frame deletion. This defect in the NSs gene results in expression of a truncated protein which is rapidly degraded. To investigate whether the presence of the wild-type NSs gene correlated with inhibition of IFN-alpha/beta production, we infected susceptible IFNAR(-/-) mice with S gene reassortant viruses. When the S segment of ZH548 was replaced by that of clone 13, the resulting reassortants became strong IFN inducers, When the defective S segment of clone 13 was exchanged with the wild-type S segment of ZH548, the reassortant virus lost the capacity to stimulate IFN-alpha/beta production. These results demonstrate that the ability of RVFV to inhibit IFN-alpha/beta production correlates with viral virulence and suggest that the accessory protein NSs is an IFN antagonist.

J	SMETANA, ALES								The artificial feeding and infecting of fleas Xenopsylla Cheopis Roths								CESK PARASITOL				11				233	238						1964	1964	The paper describes a simple apparatus for the artificial feeding of fleas and their experimental infection (modified apparatus of Pshenitchnow), and presents the results with the fleas X. cheopis Roths. The number of engorged fleas amounted to 1565 out of a total of 3270 specimens (about 48%). Fresh skins from adult white mice (Mus musculus) deprived of all subcutaneous fat and connective tissue wereusedas membranes. The fleas fed on heparinized rat blood with a 10% suspension of the tick-borne encephalitis virus in 10% rat serum. The feeding time was 1[long dash]2 hours in an incubator at a temperature of 37[degree]C. The fleas starved from 3 to 31 days before the experiment. The thickness of the skin, used for the membrane (the skin with and without the subcutaneous fat and connective tissue) has a great influence on the feeding ability of the fleas. Male fleas feed less readily than females. The considerable fluctuation of the numbers of engorged fleas in the single groups under absolutely equal conditions depends most probably on the physiological process of the organism of the fleas (age, dependence on gonotrophic cycle in females, on copulation in the males etc.). The described method is very simple, does not need a complicated apparatus, is easy to work and is especially well suited for experimental work, when tracing the role of the fleas in the transmission of germs of various infectious diseases. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19664700019535

The gut microbiome, which includes bacteria, viruses, and fungi, contributes to this environmental influence, and can induce immunological changes. The gut viral component of the microbiome, related to T1D has mostly focused on coxsackieviruses and rotavirus. The role of norovirus, another common enteric virus, in susceptibility to T1D was hitherto unknown. Norovirus is highly infectious and encountered by many children. We studied the mouse norovirus 4 (MNV4), related to human noroviruses, in the Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, to determine its role in influencing susceptibility to T1D. We infected MNV-free NOD mice with MNV4 by exposing the mice to MNV4-positive bedding from an endemically-infected mouse colony to mimic a natural infection. Control MNV-free NOD mice were exposed to MNV-free bedding from the same colony. Interestingly, MNV4 infection protected NOD mice from the development of T1D and was associated with an expansion of Tregs and reduced proinflammatory T cells. We also found MNV4 significantly modified the gut commensal bacteria composition, promoting increased alpha-diversity and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. To elucidate whether T1D protection was directly related to MNV4, or indirectly through modulating gut microbiota, we colonized germ-free (GF) NOD mice with the MNV4-containing or non-MNV4-containing viral filtrate, isolated from filtered fecal material. We found that MNV4 induced significant changes in mucosal immunity, including altered Tuft cell markers, cytokine secretion, antiviral immune signaling markers, and the concentration of mucosal antibodies. Systemically, MNV4-infection altered the immune cells including B cell subsets, macrophages and T cells, and especially induced an increase in Treg number and function. Furthermore, in vitro primary exposure of the norovirus filtrate to naive splenocytes identified significant increases in the proportion of activated and CTLA4-expressing Tregs. Our data provide novel knowledge that norovirus can protect NOD mice from T1D development by inducing the expansion of Tregs and reducing inflammatory T cells. Our study also highlights the importance of distinguishing the mucosal immunity mediated by bacteria from that by enteric viruses.																					WOS:000501204000001	31798584

Mouse monoclonal antibodies exerted a marked specific antiviral effect in tissue culture and in white mice inhibiting virus reproduction by 1-3-5 log PFU/ml. The degree of inhibition of virus reproduction is inversely proportional to the multiplicity of infection. When used in combination with remantadine, ribavirin, interferon, and its inducer poly (I) X poly (C), the monoclonal antibodies MAK-14-7 exerted additive antiviral effect.

Sequence analysis showed that the isolate had a HA cleavage site of 333PAASDR GL340, which was identity to the sequence characters of low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV). The different gene segments of the isolate showed a complicated source, which had the high homology with H9, H6, H4, H1, H11, H10 and H3 subtype LPAIVs, respectively. The infectious experiments demonstrated that the isolate had no ability to duplicate in chicken and mice. However, the virus was able to be detected in partial organs of artificially infected ducks. In addition, the infected ducks were able to shed through throat and cloaca, while the contacting infected ducks only shed through cloaca, which illustrated that the isolate had the ability of horizontal transmission.

The nature of the causal agent in experimentally infected mice								JOUR EXPTL MED				84	(1)			15	23		10.1084/jem.84.1.15				1946	1946	Coccobacilliform bodies, pleuropneumonia-like organisms, or other cultivable pathogenic bacteria were not demonstrable in lung and exudate suspensions from selected adult rats naturally infected with endemic pneumonia or from experimentally infected mice. The specific; factor in lung suspensions from mice was identified with an agent which was active on dilution through 107. It failed to pass through Berkefeld N filters but was generally present in V filtrates, with a loss is titer up to 1000-fold. It was largely removed from suspension on centrifugation at a speed of 9000 R.P.M for 30 min. Attempts to cultivate the agent in embryonated eggs were uniformly unsuccessful. In fluid suspension it failed to withstand storage at 40 [degree]C for a week but remained viable for at least 3 months in a frozen state under dry ice. The relation of the infective agent to viruses and to pleuropneumonia-like organisms is discussed. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: J. B. Nelson																					BCI:BCI19462000017966		
J	Wu, Xiaoyan; Lu, Liang; Guzman, Hilda; Tesh, Robert B.; Xiao, Shu-Yuan								Persistent infection and associated nucleotide changes of West Nile virus serially passaged in hamsters								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				89				3073	3079		10.1099/vir.0.2008/003210-0				DEC 2008	2008	Hamsters experimentally infected with the neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) strain NY385-99 frequently develop persistent renal infection and viruria. Viruses recovered from the urine of such animals no longer cause neurological disease when inoculated into naive hamsters. To examine if this phenotypic change is stable, and if additional nucleotide changes occur during further passages, a urine isolate from a persistently infected hamster (WNV 9317B) was serially passaged in hamsters, and representative isolates from each passage were analysed for pathogenesis in hamsters and by nucleotide sequencing. The progeny viruses tested all resulted in asymptomatic infection when inoculated into hamsters and caused no mortality. Most of the original nucleotide changes were retained in these serial WNV isolates. Changes were distributed throughout the genome at 116 sites, ranging from 0.082 to 0.262%, compared with the parent strain NY385-99, and they were mostly in coding regions. Our findings indicate that WNV underwent additional genetic changes during serial passage in hamsters, but there was no reversion to neurotropism and virulence.

The viral gene sequences were compared with those of other 72 strains of JEV originated from both China and abroad at different times. Finally the genotypes were analyzed with the method which was established by Woan-Ru Chen.RESULTS: All the 3-day suckling mice which were inoculated with the virus died within 78 h. The results of the nucleic acid-sequence analysis showed that 17 strains of the experimental virus belonged to genotype 1 and 2 strains belonged to genotype 3. The difference between genotype 1 and type 3 were more than 15%. While the difference between 17 strains of genotype 1 which were separated at different time, location and hosts were only 3.8%-5.2%.CONCLUSION: The above results suggest that the genotype of the epidemic JEV in Yunnan Province are type 1 and 3 and the latter is the main type.

In this study, we isolated various HSV-1 strains, named KHS, from the skin lesions of Korean patients and characterized the specific features of each strain. We found that KHS strains produced small, cell associated and nonsyncycial plaques in Vero cells. We classified KHS strains into two substrains, KHS 1 which had highly condensed plaques and KHS 2 which had less condensed plaques. Since gD protein of HSV-1 plays important roles in viral plaque formation, we determined the nucleotide sequences of gD genes of KHS strains. According to deduced amino acid sequences of gD protein in KHS strains compared with prototype strains KOS and F, we found that gD of KHS strains have more putative O-glycosidic sites, serine in KHS 1 and threonine in KHS 2, respectively.To find out the establishment of viral latency, we infected each virus strain into eyes of mice and carried out trigerminal ganglia explanting experiment. We found that both KHS strains established latent infections stably just as did the prototype KOS and F strains. The eye swab experiments were carried out to check the viral replication in vivo. KHS 1 exhibited a longer shedding time in eyes of mice. We also found that KHS 1 has a higher neurotropic affinity by determining the time it took for the virus to reach the trigerminal ganglia from the eyes. Currently, we are studying the possible mechanism of high neuroinvasiveness of KHS 1 strain.																					WOS:000182462200001	12803462

The pathogenesis of the genotypes B and C of BPIV3 infection in calves and laboratory animals have not been reported. To alleviate the difficulties associated with sourcing suitable calves for infection studies, the establishment of BPIV3 infection model using laboratory model animals could aid in increasing the knowledge of the pathogenesis of this virus. Therefore thirty Balb/c mice were intranasally inoculated with a Chinese BPIV3 strain SD0835 which was classified as genotype C. Virus replications in mice were demonstrated by using virus isolation and titration, immunofluorescent staining, and immunohistochemistry and had occurred in the respiratory tissues as early as 24 h after intranasal inoculation. The results of immunofluorescent staining and IHC implicated that the lungs and tracheas might be the major tissues in which the SD0835 infected and replicated. The histopathologic examinations revealed that alveoli septa thickening and focal cellulose pneumonia were seen in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. The aforementioned results indicated that the SD0835 of the genotype C was pathogenic to Balb/c mice and the mouse infection model could cast light on the genotype C of BPIV3 infection process and pathogenesis.

J	Njenga, MK; Pease, LR; Wettstein, P; Mak, T; Rodriguez, M								Interferon alpha/beta mediates early virus-induced expression of H-2D and H-2K in the central nervous system								LABORATORY INVESTIGATION				77	1			71	84						JUL 1997	1997	Cells of the central nervous system (CNS) normally do not express detectable levels of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class I antigens. However, MHC Class I expression can be induced after Virus infection. We tested the hypothesis that virus-induced Class I expression is mediated by lymphocytes or cytokines using lymphocyte- and cytokine-deficient mice. We used Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), which induces GNS demyelination that maps genetically to the D region of MHC Class I and is associated with high levels of Glass I products. TMEV infection of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and recombination activation gene-1-deficient mice, which lack B and T lymphocytes, resulted in equivalent H-2D and H-2K expression in brain and spinal cord, according to analysis of the area and intensity of immunoperoxidase staining. Class I antigens were demonstrated as early as 6 hours after infection, and they were more widely distributed than viral RNA, indicating that expression was induced indirectly via a soluble factor. To determine whether cytokines induced the expression, we infected mice lacking receptors for interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-alpha/beta R(-/-)), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma R(-/-)), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFRp55(-/-)). TMEV-infected IFN-gamma R(-/-) and TNFRp55(-/-) mice expressed Class I antigens in the CNS, whereas IFN-alpha/beta R(-/-) mice did not, establishing that IFN-alpha/beta mediated the expression. In contrast to the equivalent expression in SCID mice, we observed greater area and higher intensity of H-2D Versus H-2K antigens in infected SCID mice reconstituted with normal spleen cells. Collectively, the data indicate that after TMEV infection, early generalized MHC Class I expression is mediated by IFN-alpha/beta independently of lymphocytes, but the differential regulation of H-2D over H-2K may be controlled by B and/or T lymphocytes.

Chinese Journal of Viral Diseases				1	1			51	57						2011	2011	Objective: To explore the molecular basis of neurovirulence attenuation for a highly attenuated Japanese encephalitis vaccine strain, JEV SA14-14-2. Methods: The JEV SA14-14-2 attenuated virus was intracerebrally passaged on through 3 generations in suckling mice. The brains of sick mice in the first (M1) and third (M3) passages were harvested for neurovirulence testing and full-length genome sequencing. The overlapped fragments of the SA14-14-2 M1 and SA14-14-2 M3 genome were reverse-transcripted and amplified by PCR. The fragments of the 5′ and 3′ ends of viruses were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector and then sequenced. The sequences of the SA14-14-2 M1 and SA14-14-2 M3 viruses were compared with the attenuated JEV vaccine strain SA14-14-2 and its parental virus strain SA14. Results: The animal challenge study showed that the SA14-14-2 M3 virus had high virulence with respect to the infection of 3-day-old suckling-mice (LD50≥7.5), while SA14-14-2 M1 virus did not cause the animal death in 14 days. The sequence analysis indicated that only two points of reverse mutation in E region (E107: F->L, E138: K->E) of SA14-14-2 M3 were different from that of SA14-14-2 M1. The two points of reverse mutation were closely related to the increased viral virulence. There were also two points of reverse mutation at the NS3-343 and NS4A-27 in both the SA14-14-2 M1 and M3 viruses compared to SA14-14-2. Conclusions: The mutation of E107 and E138 was the molecular basis for the attenuated Japanese encephalitis vaccine strain of SA14-14-2. The role of mutation points in NS regions is worth of further study.																					CABI:20123316596

Recently, cotton rats have been proposed as an animal model to study the innate immune response against FLUAV and other human pathogens. The interferon (IFN)-induced Mx GTPases are part of the cell-autonomous innate immune response against viruses. We, therefore, tested the antiviral activity of the two cotton rat Mx proteins that were recently identified. The nuclear cotton rat Mx1 protein was found to be a strong inhibitor of FLUAV, whereas the cytoplasmic cotton rat Mx2 protein was inactive. Cotton rat Mx2, but not cotton rat Mx1, was able to inhibit the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and the bunyavirus Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) known to replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Thus, cotton rats possess two Mx proteins that have selective antiviral activity that depends on their intracellular localization. We conclude that the Mx status of cotton rats differs from that of conventional inbred mouse strains, which are known to have defective Mx genes. Therefore, cotton rats are a suitable animal model to study experimental infections with FLUAV and other RNA viruses.																					WOS:000250715100003	17970694

The number of leucocytes decreased. When the cattle C virus was transferred to mouse brains, the neutrophil and lymphocyte values of the differential blood picture in the 1st passages were about normal. In the neurotropic passage ranges, the picture shows an inversion of those values. Infection with neurotropic foot-and-mouth disease virus causes in mice a marked leucopenia attributable to the heavy reduction in lymphocytes (lymphopenia). The reaction of the neutrophils appears as a slight shift to the left; the absolute values remain unchanged. It may be possible to use the inversion of the neutrophil and lymphocyte values as a "marker" of the neurotropic foot-and-mouth virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19654600007589

Prophylactic and therapeutic combination effects of rimantadine and oseltamivir against influenza virus A (H3N2) infection in mice								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				95	2			172	181		10.1016/j.antiviral.2012.05.004				AUG 2012	2012	The combined effect of rimantadine and oseltamivir in a prophylactic context (therapy beginning 4 h pre-virus infection) and therapeutic context (therapy started at 24 h post-viral inoculation) course on influenza H3N2 virus infection in mice was studied. In the prophylactic course 5 and 10 mg/kg/day rimantadine with 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg/day (25:1 dose ratio) oseltamivir showed a protection index (PI) of 79.6% and 75%, respectively and a mean survival time (MST) of 13.1 and 12.9 days. The individual effects of the same doses ranged from 0% to 33.3% PI and 8.2 to 10.3 days MST, respectively. Lung virus titers were decreased 630-fold in the combination-treated groups as compared to monotherapy and placebo groups. The reduction of surface lung pathology in combination-treated groups demonstrated a protective effect for the combination of both antivirals. In the therapeutic course 5 and 10 mg/kg rimantadine combined with 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg oseltamivir showed no beneficial effect. At higher dosage (0.8, 1.6, 3.2 mg/kg oseltamivir and 20, 40, 80 mg/kg rimantadine) preserving the 25:1 ratio, the resultant PI ranged from 57.6% to 80.5% and the MST was 12.8-13.4 days. Used alone at the same doses the compounds' protection varied between 10.7% and 71.8% PI, MST 9.8-12.8 days (8.7 days in PBS control). Compared to vehicle and individual treatment, a decrease in infectious viral titers of up to 1000-fold and other viral pneumonia parameters were also recorded. The therapeutic effect of the drugs' optimal effective doses combinations was characterized as synergistic. Survival of animals was 81.2-100% and MST was extended by 5-7 days compared to placebos. Monotherapy protection was from 9.1% to a maximum of 56.5%, MST being prolonged only by 1.3-4.2 days compared to 7.5 days in the PBS control group. Lung viral titers were decreased 1445-fold for the most efficacious combination groups and a significant reduction in lung parameters was observed. These data emphasize that prophylactic and therapeutic courses using a combination of oseltamivir and rimantadine have a significant protective effect in mice experimentally infected with drug-sensitive influenza virus A (H3N2).

Gammaherpesvirus Small Noncoding RNAs Are Bifunctional Elements That Regulate Infection and Contribute to Virulence In Vivo								MBIO				6	1					e01670-14	10.1128/mBio.01670-14				JAN-FEB 2015	2015	Many viruses express noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs). The gammaherpesviruses (gamma HVs), including Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and murine gamma HV68, each contain multiple ncRNA genes, including microRNAs (miRNAs). While these ncRNAs can regulate multiple host and viral processes in vitro, the genetic contribution of these RNAs to infection and pathogenesis remains largely unknown. To study the functional contribution of these RNAs to gamma HV infection, we have used gamma HV68, a small-animal model of gamma HV pathogenesis. gamma HV68 encodes eight small hybrid ncRNAs that contain both tRNA-like elements and functional miRNAs. These genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase III and are referred to as the gamma HV68 TMERs (tRNA-miRNA-encoded RNAs). To determine the total concerted genetic contribution of these ncRNAs to gamma HV acute infection and pathogenesis, we generated and characterized a recombinant gamma HV68 strain devoid of all eight TMERs. TMER-deficient gamma HV68 has wild-type levels of lytic replication in vitro and normal establishment of latency in B cells early following acute infection in vivo. In contrast, during acute infection of immunodeficient mice, TMER-deficient gamma HV68 has reduced virulence in a model of viral pneumonia, despite having an enhanced frequency of virus-infected cells. Strikingly, expression of a single viral tRNA-like molecule, in the absence of all other virus-encoded TMERs and miRNAs, reverses both attenuation in virulence and enhanced frequency of infected cells. These data show that gamma HV ncRNAs play critical roles in acute infection and virulence in immunocompromised hosts and identify these RNAs as a new potential target to modulate gamma HV-induced infection and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The gammaherpesviruses (gamma HVs) are a subfamily of viruses associated with chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. These viruses uniformly encode multiple types of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are not translated into proteins. It remains unclear how virus-expressed ncRNAs influence the course and outcome of infection in vivo. Here, we generated a mouse gamma HV that lacks the expression of multiple ncRNAs. Notably, this mutant virus is critically impaired in the ability to cause disease in immunocompromised hosts yet shows a paradoxical increase in infected cells early during infection in these hosts. While the original mouse virus encodes multiple ncRNAs, the expression of a single domain of one ncRNA can partially reverse the defects of the mutant virus. These studies demonstrate that gamma HV ncRNAs can directly contribute to virus-induced disease in vivo and that these RNAs may be multifunctional, allowing the opportunity to specifically interfere with different functional domains of these RNAs.

Recently, Zika virus (ZIKV) which spreads from Asia to American and causes millions of infections emerges as a new dangerous member of the genus of Flavivirus. Unlike other well-known flaviviruses, ZIKV can be transmitted sexually and infect testes in murine models. Its impacts on sperm functions, and the exact susceptible cells, however, are not entirely clear. To investigate these issues, we infected interferon a/b and gamma receptors deficient AG6 mice with ZIKV and examined the outcomes of infection using an assortment of physiological, histopathological, immunological, and virological techniques. We found that infectedmice displayed signs of reproductive system disorder, altered androgen levels in serum, and high viral load in semen and testes. Additionally, histopathological examinations revealed marked atrophy of seminiferous tubules and significant reduction in lumen size. Notably, these were accompanied by positive staining of ZIKV antigens on sertoli cells, detection of viral particles and vacuole changes within cytoplasm of sertoli cells. The susceptibility of sertoli cells to ZIKV was further validated in vitro study using cell lines. Importantly, the disruption of tight junctions within testis and altered sperm morphology were also observed in ZIKV infected mice. It is well-known that tight junctions formed by adjacent sertoli cells are major component of blood testis barrier, which plays important roles in maintenance of microenvironment for spermagenesis in testis. Taken together, these results demonstrate that sertoli cells are susceptible to ZIKV infection, which results in the disruption of tight junctions in testis and causes abnormal spermatogenesis in mice. These results also imply that long-term impact of ZIKV infection on human male reproductive system requires close monitoring.																					WOS:000403718500002	28680856	
J	Becher, Peter Moritz; Gotzhein, Frauke; Klingel, Karin; Escher, Felicitas; Blankenberg, Stefan; Westermann, Dirk; Lindner, Diana								Cardiac Function Remains Impaired Despite Reversible Cardiac Remodeling after Acute Experimental Viral Myocarditis								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY RESEARCH				2017						6590609	10.1155/2017/6590609				2017	2017	Background. Infection with Coxsackievirus B3 induces myocarditis. We aimed to compare the acute and chronic phases of viral myocarditis to identify the immediate effects of cardiac inflammation as well as the long-term effects after resolved inflammation on cardiac fibrosis and consequently on cardiac function. Material and Methods. We infected C57BL/6J mice with Coxsackievirus B3 and determined the hemodynamic function 7 as well as 28 days after infection. Subsequently, we analyzed viral burden and viral replication in the cardiac tissue as well as the expression of cytokines and matrix proteins. Furthermore, cardiac fibroblasts were infected with virus to investigate if viral infection alone induces profibrotic signaling. Results. Severe cardiac inflammation was determined and cardiac fibrosis was consistently colocalized with inflammation during the acute phase of myocarditis. Declined cardiac inflammation but no significantly improved hemodynamic function was observed 28 days after infection. Interestingly, cardiac fibrosis declined to basal levels as well. Both cardiac inflammation and fibrosis were reversible, whereas the hemodynamic function remains impaired after healed viral myocarditis in C57BL/6J mice.

The viruses producing cytopathic effect with syncytium formation were isolated from the wasted nude mice by DBT cells, and were identified as mouse coronavirus by direct immunofluorescence. The nude mouse colony was closed and all the nude mice (about 500) were killed by the reason of disease control. At autopsy about 60% of nude mice showed necrotic hepatitis. By the virus isolation to see the source of contamination, viruses were isolated from the feces of apparently healthy mice of ICR, CDF1, DBA/2 and C3H, and from human cancer cell line stocked in liquid nitrogen. In experimental infection, the isolates produced only mild hepatitis in ICR mice treated with cortisone. By cross-neutralization test, the nude isolate reacted closely with the virus from C3H mice but not with the virus from cancer cell line. The isolates from nude and C3H mice produced experimentally wasting disease with necrotic hepatitis in nude mice. These findings suggest that wasting disease is nude mice might be caused by low-virulent mouse coronavirus shed in feces from C3H mice introduced before the outbreak of disease.

The innate immunity restricted by the V protein is induced through activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3). The V protein has been shown to interact with melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) and to inhibit beta interferon production. In the present study, we infected MDA5-knockout mice with V-deficient SeV and found that MDA5 was largely unrelated to the innate immunity that the V protein suppresses in vivo. We therefore investigated the target of the SeV V protein. We previously reported interaction of the V protein with IRF3. Here we extended the observation and showed that the V protein appeared to inhibit translocation of IRF3 into the nucleus. We also found that the V protein inhibited IRF3 activation when induced by a constitutive active form of IRF3. The V proteins of measles virus and Newcastle disease virus inhibited IRF3 transcriptional activation, as did the V protein of SeV, while the V proteins of mumps virus and Nipah virus did not, and inhibition by these proteins correlated with interaction of each V protein with IRF3. These results indicate that IRF3 is important as an alternative target of paramyxovirus V proteins.																					WOS:000305501600012	22532687

Although the immune response to CHIKV has been studied, a better understanding of the virus-host interaction mechanisms may lead to more effective therapeutic interventions. In this context, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as a key mediator involved in the control of many pathogens, including several bacteria and viruses, but no reports of this important protective mechanism were documented during CHIKV infection. Here we demonstrate that the experimental infection of mouse-isolated neutrophils with CHIKV resulted in NETosis (NETs release) through a mechanism dependent on TLR7 activation and reactive oxygen species generation. In vitro, mouse-isolated neutrophils stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate release NETs that once incubated with CHIKV, resulting in further virus capture and neutralization. In vivo, NETs inhibition by the treatment of the mice with DNase resulted in the enhanced susceptibility of IFNAR / mice to CHIKV experimental acute infection. Lastly, by accessing the levels of MPO-DNA complex on the acutely CHIKV-infected patients, we found a correlation between the levels of NETs and the viral load in the blood, suggesting that NETs are also released in natural human infection cases. Altogether our findings characterize NETosis as a contributing natural process to control CHIKV acute infection, presenting an antiviral effect that helps to control systemic virus levels.

Relationship of sunlight and humidity on the virulence of street rabies virus in saliva								INDIAN JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCES				79	1			24	25						JAN 2009	2009	Experimentally infected, suckling albino mice (72) were inoculated with 3090 MICLD50 of street rabies virus isolated from rabid dog, by intra-cerebral route, to analyze the effect of humidity on virulence of street rabies virus (SRV) in saliva. Increase in virulence of SRV was found with rise in environmental humidity in absence of sunlight. However, in presence of sunlight the environmental humidity and virulence of SRV was inversely proportional. Thus, it can be concluded that in hot and humid weather conditions the virulence of SRV is increased during night but decreased during sunny humid days.																					WOS:000262694200007

We have previously shown that RSV induces reactive oxygen species in cultured cells and oxidative injury in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. The mechanism(s) of RSV-induced oxidative stress in vivo is not known.Objectives : To measure changes of lung antioxidant enzymes expression/activity and activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a transcription factor that regulates detoxifying and antioxidant enzyme gene expression, in mice and in infants with naturally acquired RSV infection.Methods: Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD 1), SOD 2, SOD 3, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase, as well as Nrf2 expression, were measured in murine bronchoalveolar lavage, cell extracts of conductive airways, and/or in human nasopharyngeal secretions by Western blot and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Antioxidant enzyme activity and markers of oxidative cell injury were measured in either murine bronchoalveolar lavage or nasopharyngeal secretions by colorimetric/immunoassays.Measurements and Main Results : RSV infection induced a significant decrease in the expression and/or activity of SOD, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and glutathione peroxidase in murine lungs and in the airways of children with severe bronchiolitis. Markers of oxidative damage correlated with severity of clinical illness in RSV-infected infants. Nrf2 expression was also significantly reduced in the lungs of viral-infected mice.Conclusions: RSV infection induces significant down-regulation of the airway antioxidant system in vivo, likely resulting in lung oxidative damage. Modulation of oxidative stress may pave the way toward important advances in the therapeutic approach of RSV-induced acute lung disease.																					WOS:000291647200020	21471094

To address whether pandemic SARS-CoV-2 G614 variant has evolved to become more pathogenic, we infected adult hamsters (>10 months old) with two natural SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying either D614 or G614 spike protein to mimic infection of the adult/elderly human population. Hamsters infected by the two variants exhibited comparable viral loads and pathology in lung tissues as well as similar amounts of virus shed in nasal washes. Altogether, our study does not find that naturally circulating D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 variants differ significantly in pathogenicity in hamsters.																					WOS:000624564600004	33556653

Manipulation of apoptosis and necroptosis signaling by herpesviruses								MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND IMMUNOLOGY				204	3			439	448		10.1007/s00430-015-0410-5				JUN 2015	2015	Like apoptosis, necroptosis is an innate immune mechanism that eliminates pathogen-infected cells. Receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP)3 (also called RIPK3) mediates necrotic death by phosphorylating an executioner protein, MLKL, leading to plasma membrane leakage. The pathway is triggered against viruses that block caspase 8. In murine CMV, the viral inhibitor of caspase 8 activation prevents extrinsic apoptosis but also has the potential to unleash necroptosis. This virus encodes the viral inhibitor of RIP activation to prevent RIP homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)-dependent signal transduction and necroptosis. Recent investigations reveal a similar mechanism at play in the human alpha-herpesviruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV)1 and HSV2, where RHIM competitor function and caspase 8 suppression are carried out by the virus-encoded large subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (R1). In human cells, R1 inhibition of caspase 8 prevents TNF-induced apoptosis, but sensitizes to TNF-induced necroptosis. The RHIM and caspase 8 interaction domains of R1 collaborate to prevent RIP3-dependent steps and enable both herpesviruses to deflect host cell death machinery that would cut short infection. In mouse cells, HSV1 infection by itself triggers necroptosis by driving RIP3 protein kinase activity. HSV1 R1 contributes to the activation of RIP3 adaptor function in mice, a popular host animal for experimental infection. Based on these studies, infection of RIP3-kinase inactive mice should be explored in models of pathogenesis and latency. The necrotic death pathway that is suppressed during infection in the natural host becomes a cross-species barrier to infection in a non-natural host.

In March and April 2006, novel H3N1 influenza A viruses were isolated from pigs with respiratory diseases at two different commercial swine farms in Korea. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of all eight viral RNA segments showed that the novel H3N1 swine influenza viruses were reassortants that acquired the hemagglutinin gene from an H3 human-like virus and other genes from swine influenza viruses that are currently circulating in Korea. Serologic and virologic tests in the infected farms suggested that pig-to-pig and farm-to-farm transmissions occurred. Clinical signs in pigs and experimentally infected mice suggest the potential to transmit the virus between swine and other mammalian hosts. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation of the swine H3N1 subtype from domestic pigs under field conditions in Korea. Further surveillance will be needed to determine whether this novel subtype will continue to circulate in the swine population.																					WOS:000242056800013	16928961

In this virus, the TATA, CAAT and GC boxes of the putative latency associated transcript (LAT) gene promoter were replaced during homologous recombination with a reporter gene (E. coli lacZ gene) under regulation of an additional ADV gX gene promoter. Despite loss of the LAT promoter region, the mutant virus replicated in vitro as efficiently as its wild type parent. Virulence of the altered virus still approximated that of the parental virus as determined by lethal dose 50% titration in mice. After 60 days postinfection of swine, recombinant viral genomes were shown to be present within the trigeminal nerve ganglia by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, a continuous RNA, lacking the ADV large LAT intron region, was detected by reverse transcription PCR. Therefore, deletion of the putative LAT promoter region does not prevent the expression of the LAT or the ability of ADV to establish latency in its natural host animal.

Sur la presence du virus rabique dans la salive des chiens sains								ARCH INST PASTEUR ALGERIE				24	(3/4)			289	293						1946	1946	Vampire bats can excrete rabies virus in their saliva for several months following apparent recovery from their clinical infection. The authors review in detail a number of reports indicating that the same is possible in dogs. While the great majority of rabid dogs die from their infection, a few are reported to have either recovered or to have shown no symptoms of disease at any time. Such subclinical infections in dogs are rare, but humans bitten by such animals may receive no antirabic treatment because the offending animal remains healthy on observation. Several deaths are attributed to such a sequence of events. Presence of rabies virus in the saliva of healthy dogs is, however, undoubtedly so rare as to make any change in the present recommendations for the prevention of rabies quite unnecessary. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: E.

In recent years, human primary immunodeficiencies affecting either the production of (UNC-93B deficiency) or the response to (STAT1 and TYK2 deficiencies) these IFNs have been reported. Affected patients are highly susceptible to certain viruses. Patients with STAT1 or TYK2 deficiency are susceptible to multiple viruses, including herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1), whereas UNC-93B-deficient patients present isolated HSV-1 encephalitis. However, these immunological defects are not limited to type I IFN-mediated immunity. Impaired type II IFN (IFN gamma)-mediated immunity plays no more than a minor role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases in these patients, but the contribution of impaired type III IFN (IFN-lambda)-mediated immunity remains to be determined. These novel inherited disorders strongly suggest that type I IFN-mediated immunity is essential for protection against natural infections caused by several viruses in humans.

We have previously shown that, during the early stage of infection, CDV replicates transiently in selective structures of the brain including the substantia nigra, a structure known to play a critical role in motor control. In this study we demonstrate that CDV replication in the substantia nigra induces an early decrease in transcript level of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis. The CDV infection of neuroblastoma cell culture, constitutively expressing TH, results in downregulation of TH transcription in the absence of cell death. In the few surviving mice with motor deficiencies, a pronounced decrease in TH expression is associated with a loss of dopaminergic cell bodies in the absence of any viral transcripts and proteins, suggesting that the initial CDV infection was sufficient to trigger irreversible neurodegenerative processes.

In the mouse model of murine CMV infection (MCMV), it has been shown that infection peaks on days 5 to 7 after experimental infection, when 0.01 to 0.1% of the circulating leukocytes contain viral DNA. In our laboratory, MCMV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization predominantly in the mononuclear cells on day 6 after acute infection. Infectious virus was recovered from day 6 mononuclear fractions in 16 of 16 mice compared with that from day 6 polymorphonuclear fractions in 4 of 16 mice. An eclipse phenomenon was noted in the blood leukocytes by quantitative blot hybridization: the amount of MCMV DNA present was small on day 2, diminished on days 3 and 4, and then increased markedly on days 5 and 6 in both the mononuclear and polymorphonuclear fractions immediately following viral augmentation in the liver and spleen. MCMV immediate-early and glycoprotein B (late) transcripts were present in pooled mononuclear fractions only on day 6 of acute infection but not in pooled polymorphonuclear fractions. Collectively, these data demonstrate that (i) circulating leukocytes, predominantly mononuclear, are involved in dissemination of MCMV; (ii) a primary viremia with dissemination of MCMV to reticuloendothelial organs (liver and spleen) occurs and is followed by viral amplification and a subsequent, more intense secondary viremia; and (iii) immediate-early viral mRNA and glycoprotein B mRNA transcripts are detectable only during peak infection on day 6 in mononuclear leukocytes but not in polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

We describe a series of experimental infections designed to investigate whether animals within certain taxonomic groups in North America have the potential to serve as ZIKV amplifying or maintenance hosts. Species investigated included armadillos, cottontail rabbits, goats, mink, chickens, pigeons, ground hogs, deer mice, cattle, raccoons, ducks, Syrian Golden hamsters, garter snakes, leopard frogs, house sparrows, and pigs. Infectious virus was isolated from blood only in frogs and armadillos; however, the magnitude of viremia was low. In addition, neutralizing antibodies were detected after infection in goats, rabbits, ducks, frogs, and pigs. This study indicates that the animals tested to date are unlikely to act as animal reservoirs for ZIKV, but that rabbits and pigs could potentially serve as sentinel species. Understanding the transmission cycle and maintenance of ZIKV in animals will help in developing effective surveillance programs and preventative measures for future outbreaks.

SARM Is Required for Neuronal Injury and Cytokine Production in Response to Central Nervous System Viral Infection								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				191	2			875	883		10.4049/jimmunol.1300374				JUL 15 2013	2013	Four of the five members of the Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor family are required for signaling downstream of TLRs, promoting innate immune responses against different pathogens. However, the role of the fifth member of this family, sterile a and Toll/IL-1R domain-containing 1 (SARM), is unclear. SARM is expressed primarily in the CNS where it is required for axonal death. Studies in Caenorhabditis elegans have also shown a role for SARM in innate immunity. To clarify the role of mammalian SARM in innate immunity, we infected SARM(-/-) mice with a number of bacterial and viral pathogens. SARM(-/-) mice show normal responses to Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and influenza virus, but show dramatic protection from death after CNS infection with vesicular stomatitis virus. Protection correlates with reduced CNS injury and cytokine production by nonhematopoietic cells, suggesting that SARM is a positive regulator of cytokine production. Neurons and microglia are the predominant source of cytokines in vivo, supporting a role for SARM as a link between neuronal injury and innate immunity.

R	Katze, Michael G								Integrative deep sequencing of the mouse lung transcriptome reveals differential expression of diverse classes of small RNAs in response to respiratory virus infection.								European Nucleotide Archive															2015-06-16	2012	We previously reported widespread differential expression of long non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in response to virus infection. Here, we expanded the study through small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis of the host response to both severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza virus infections across four founder mouse strains of the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits. We observed differential expression of over 200 small RNAs of diverse classes during infection. A majority of identified microRNAs (miRNAs) showed divergent changes in expression across mouse strains with respect to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infections and responded differently to a highly pathogenic reconstructed 1918 virus compared to a minimally pathogenic seasonal influenza virus isolate. Novel insights into miRNA expression changes, including the association with pathogenic outcomes and large differences between in vivo and in vitro experimental systems, were further elucidated by a survey of selected miRNAs across diverse virus infections. The small RNAs identified also included many non-miRNA small RNAs, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), in addition to nonannotated small RNAs. An integrative sequencing analysis of both small RNAs and long transcripts from the same samples showed that the results revealing differential expression of miRNAs during infection were largely due to transcriptional regulation and that the predicted miRNA-mRNA network could modulate global host responses to virus infection in a combinatorial fashion. These findings represent the first integrated sequencing analysis of the response of host small RNAs to virus infection and show that small RNAs are an integrated component of complex networks involved in regulating the host response to infection. IMPORTANCE: Most studies examining the host transcriptional response to infection focus only on protein-coding genes. However, mammalian genomes transcribe many short and long non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). With the advent of deepsequencing technologies, systematic transcriptome analysis of the host response, including analysis of ncRNAs of different sizes, is now possible. Using this approach, we recently discovered widespread differential expression of host long (200 nucleotide[nt]) ncRNAs in response to virus infection. Here, the samples described in the previous report were again used, but we sequenced another fraction of the transcriptome to study very short (about 20 to 30 nt) ncRNAs. We demonstrated that virus infection also altered expression of many short ncRNAs of diverse classes. Putting the results of the two studies together, we show that small RNAs may also play an important role in regulating the host response to virus infection. Overall design: The small RNA transcriptome deep sequencing analysis was performed on lung samples from our previously published study (Unique signatures of long noncoding RNA expression in response to virus infection and altered innate immune signaling , X Peng, MBio. 2010 Oct 26;1(5). pii: e00206-10.). We infected four of the eight founder mouse strains used in generating the Collaborative Cross, a recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits (41). These strains included 129S1/SvImJ (129/S1), WSB/EiJ (WSB), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and CAST/EiJ (CAST) mice. Ten-week-old mice were intranasally infected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) alone or with 1X10^5 PFU of mouse adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV; rMA15), or 500 PFU of influenza A virus strain A/Pr/8/34 (H1N1; PR8). To match the previous whole-transcriptome analysis, we performed small RNA transcriptome sequencing analysis on the same eight samples from mice with SARS-CoV infections, including one SARS-CoV rMA15-infected mouse and one matched mock-infected mouse from each of the four strains at 2 days postinfection (dpi). In addition, we sequenced the small RNA transcriptome for 12 samples obtained from influenza virus infected mice, including two PR8-infected mice and one matched mockinfected mouse from each of the four strains at 2 dpi.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				35	10			783	786						2013	2013	To study the biological characteristics of a H5N2 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV), an AW DK/CQ/036/12 was isolated from duck in a live poultry market in China and subjected to sequencing analysis and animal pathogenic tests. The sequencing results showed that the isolate had a HA cleavage site of 341R-346TRGLF350, which was a characteristic structure of low pathogenic AIV, and the M and NP genes were highly homologous to H4, and H7 subtypes, respectively. In addition, the pathogenic test showed that the isolate was able to shedding through the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but unable to efficient replication in chicken. However, the virus was restricted replication in lung and nasal shall in the experimentally infected mice, indicating that the isolate was low-pathogenic to both chicken and mouse.

Early production of type I interferon during West Nile virus infection: Role for lymphoid tissues in IRF3-independent interferon production								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				81	17			9100	9108		10.1128/JVI.00316-07				SEP 2007	2007	Infection of cells with flaviviruses in vitro is reduced by pretreatment with small amounts of type I interferon (IFN-alpha/beta). Similarly, pretreatment of animals with IFN and experiments using mice defective in IFN signaling have indicated a role for IFN in controlling flavivirus disease in vivo. These data, along with findings that flavivirus-infected cells block IFN signaling, suggest that flavivirus infection can trigger an IFN response. To investigate IFN gene induction by the very first cells infected during in vivo infection with the flavivirus West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with high-titer preparations of WNV virus-like particles (VLPs), which initiate viral genome replication in cells but fail to spread. These studies demonstrated a brisk production of IFN in vivo, with peak levels of over 1,000 units/ml detected in sera between 8 and 24 h after inoculation by either the intraperitoneal or footpad route. The IFN response was dependent on genome replication, and WNV genomes and WNV antigen-positive cells were readily detected in the popliteal lymph nodes (pLN) of VLP-inoculated mice. High levels of IFN mRNA transcripts and functional IFN were also produced in VLP-inoculated IFN regulatory factor 3 null (IRF3(-/-)) mice, indicating that IFN production was independent of the IRF3 pathways to IFN gene transcription, consistent with the IFN type produced (predominantly alpha).

Consistently, human genetic studies have shown that type II IFN is largely redundant for immunity against viruses in the course of natural infections. The precise contributions of human type I and III IFNs remain undefined. However, various inborn errors of anti-viral IFN immunity have been described, which can result in either broad or narrow immunological and viral phenotypes. The broad disorders impair the response to (STAT1, TYK2) or the production of at least type I and type III IFNs following multiple stimuli (NEMO), resulting in multiple viral infections at various sites, including herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE). The narrow disorders impair exclusively (TLR3) or mostly (UNC-93B, TRIF, TRAF3) the TLR3-dependent induction of type I and III IFNs, leading to HSE in apparently otherwise healthy individuals. These recent discoveries highlight the importance of human type I and III IFNs in protective immunity against viruses, including the TLR3-IFN pathway in protection against HSE.

The virus was re-isolated in mice from almost every tissue (liver, spleen, lungs, brain, kidney, adrenal, lymph node and heart) obtained from dead goats. Complement fixing antigens were detected in the tissues of dead goats, the titre of which correlated positively with the infectivity titre. All infected animals developed complement-fixing and haemagglutination inhibiting antibodies to Wesselsbron virus.

Removal of the A26 protein from the WR strain mature virus generates a mutant, WR Delta A26, that enters HeLa cells through plasma membrane fusion. Here, we infected murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) with wild-type strain WR and the WR Delta A26 mutant and analyzed viral gene expression and cellular innate immune signaling. In contrast to previous studies, in which both HeLa cells infected with WR and HeLa cells infected with WR Delta A26 expressed abundant viral late proteins, we found that WR expressed much less viral late protein than WR Delta A26 in BMDM. Microarray analysis of the cellular transcripts in BMDM induced by virus infection revealed that WR preferentially activated type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent signaling but WR Delta A26 did not. We consistently detected a higher level of soluble beta interferon secretion and phosphorylation of the STAT1 protein in BMDM infected with WR than in BMDM infected with WR Delta A26. When IFNAR-knockout BMDM were infected with WR, late viral protein expression increased, confirming that IFNAR-dependent signaling was differentially induced by WR and, in turn, restricted viral late gene expression. Finally, wildtype C57BL/6 mice were more susceptible to mortality from WR Delta A26 infection than to that from WR infection, whereas IFNAR-knockout mice were equally susceptible to WR and WR Delta A26 infection, demonstrating that the ability of WR Delta A26 to evade IFNAR signaling has an important influence on viral pathogenesis in vivo.IMPORTANCE The vaccinia virus A26 protein was previously shown to mediate virus attachment and to regulate viral endocytosis. Here, we show that infection with strain WR induces a robust innate immune response that activates type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR)-dependent cellular genes in BMDM, whereas infection with the WR Delta A26 mutant does not. We further demonstrated that the differential activation of IFNAR-dependent cellular signaling between WR and WR Delta A26 not only is important for differential host restriction in BMDM but also is important for viral virulence in vivo. Our study reveals a new property of WR Delta A26, which is in regulating host antiviral innate immunity in vitro and in vivo.																					WOS:000408321600019	28659486

The genome and viral antigens were detected in all investigated organs (1-30 dpi) and the neutralising antibodies from seven to 30 dpi. The brain contained perivascular haemorrhage (6 dpi); in the liver, midzonal haemorrhage and lytic necrosis (6 dpi) were observed. The kidney had bleeding in the Bowman's capsule and tubular necrosis (6 dpi). Pyknotic lymphocytes were observed in the spleen (1-20 dpi), the lung had haemorrhage (2-6 dpi), in the endocardium it contained nuclear pyknosis and necrosis (2-3 dpi) and the stomach contained blood in the lumen (6 dpi).MAIN FINDINGS Squirrel monkeys reliably reproduced the responses observed in human cases of yellow fever and, therefore, constitute an excellent experimental model for studies on the pathophysiology of the disease.

Aerosol exposure caused early massive infection of olfactory epithelium, which developed into bilaterally symmetrical infection of the olfactory nerves, olfactory bulbs, and lateral olfactory tracts by day 2 postinfection. After subcutaneous inoculation, VEE in the brain also appeared first in olfactory regions, but was not detected until day 3 postinfection. By day 4 postinfection, VEE viral infection had spread throughout the brain in both groups, Vascular endothelium and the choroid plexus remained uninfected during the entire study.Conclusions.-Our findings suggest that VEE virus, whether given by aerosol or subcutaneously, first enters the brain through the olfactory tract.

In order to elucidate the role of maternal immunity to Hantavirus infection inrats, the protective effect of the maternal antibody were studies by using rats experimentally infected with Seoul virusstrain HR80-39. Antibody titers of sera and viral antigen against Seoul virus were investigated by indirectimmunofluorscence antibody technique (IFA). The dam sera had IFA antibody titers ranging from 1:128 to 1:1,024 afterparturition. In fetuses, IFA antibody titers ranged from 1:16 to 1:64 just after birth, increased to peak titers ranged from1:256 to 1:1,024 in the 2nd week after birth. Challenged newborn rats had IFA antibody titers ranging from 1:64 to1:1,024 after inoculation. No viral antigen was detected in lungs or other organs of the newborn rats. The maternalantibody to Seoul virus was transferred prenatally through placenta and postnatally via colostrum from immune dams totheir offspring. These results demonstrated that maternal antibody to Seoul virus was quite effective in protecting newborn rats against same virus infection.																					KJD:ART001168864

Risk assessment of minute virus of mice transmission during rederivation: detection in reproductive organs, gametes, and embryos of mice after in vivo infection.								Biology of Reproduction				81	5			1010	1015		10.1095/biolreprod.109.076968				2009	2009	Murine parvoviruses, including minute virus of mice (MVM), represent major infectious disease problems encountered in contemporary laboratory animal research facilities with embryo transfer (ET), one of the most widely used techniques for rederivation. Using an in vivo approach, the objectives of this study were to assess the risk of MVM transmission during rederivation and to provide data that allow recommendation of preventive measures. Therefore, we determined whether immunosuppressive variant MVMi viral DNA is detectable in reproductive organs, gametes (oocytes and spermatozoa), and embryos collected from experimentally infected mice and whether washing as recommended before ET eliminates MVMi sufficiently from gametes and embryos. Fractions of reproductive organs tested positive from Day 5 to Day 30 postinoculation, demonstrating a risk for a minimum period of 4 wk; the highest incidence of positive organs was found between Day 9 and Day 13 postinoculation. Real-time PCR detected viral DNA to a lesser extent in male than in female reproductive organs. MVMi DNA was detected in oocytes and sperm cells derived after in vivo infection but not in two-cell embryos. In vitro contamination studies revealed that the virus firmly adheres to the zona pellucida after 10 wash steps, indicating that even extensive washing might not eliminate MVMi completely from embryos. According to this systematic in vivo approach, recommended measures to prevent transmission of MVM during rederivation include sufficient washing of embryos, accompanying testing using adequate (PCR) methods, and using embryos rather than in vitro fertilization techniques; furthermore, the exchange of gametes should be considered a risk factor.

A recent report provided evidence that the p75(NTR) is a rabies virus receptor in cultured BSR cells. We studied the experimental infection of 6-day-old p75(NTR)-deficient mice with the challenge virus standard strain of fixed rabies virus inoculated intracerebrally. The mice developed a fatal encephalitis. There were morphologic changes of apoptotic cell death involving neurons in widespread areas of the brain, which were associated with in situ evidence of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. The findings were very similar to those that we previously reported in wild-type ICR mice of the same age. If the p75(NTR) is an important receptor of rabies virus in animal hosts, then a greater effect on the clinical and pathologic features of rabies virus-infected p75(NTR)-deficient mice would have been expected.

Two different swine enteric coronaviruses (porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and Delta coronavirus) have been isolated from the affected swine population. The disease has been reported from at least 32 states of the United States and other countries, including Mexico, Peru, Dominican Republic, Canada, Columbia, Ecuador, and Ukraine, with repeated outbreaks in previously infected herds. Here we report the isolation and characterization of a novel mammalian orthoreovirus 3 (MRV3) from diarrheic feces of piglets from these outbreaks in three states and ring-dried swine blood meal from multiple sources. MRV3 could not be isolated from healthy or pigs that had recovered from epidemic diarrhea from four states. Several MRV3 isolates were obtained from chloroform-extracted pig feces or blood meal in cell cultures or developing chicken embryos. Biological characterization of two representative isolates revealed trypsin resistance and thermostability at 90 degrees C. NextGen sequencing of ultrapurified viruses indicated a strong homology of the S1 segment to mammalian and bat MRV3. Neonatal piglets experimentally infected with these viruses or a chloroform extract of swine blood meal developed severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis with 100% mortality within 3 days postinfection. Therefore, the novel porcine MRV3 may contribute to enteric disease along with other swine enteric viruses. The role of MRV3 in the current outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea in the United States remains to be determined, but the pathogenic nature of the virus warrants further investigations on its epidemiology and prevalence.IMPORTANCE Porcine orthoreoviruses causing diarrhea have been reported in China and Korea but not in the United States. We have isolated and characterized two pathogenic reassortant MRV3 isolates from swine fecal samples from porcine epidemic diarrhea outbreaks and ring-dried swine blood meal in the United States. These fecal and blood meal isolates or a chloroform extract of blood meal induced severe diarrhea and mortality in experimentally infected neonatal pigs. Genetic and phylogenetic analyses of two MRV3 isolates revealed that they are identical but differed significantly from nonpathogenic mammalian orthoreoviruses circulating in the United States. The present study provides a platform for immediate development of suitable vaccines and diagnostics to prevent and control porcine orthoreovirus diarrhea.

No. D 31								102	p. 102						1962	1962	In 1958 4 viral agents adapted to white mouse brain were isolated from trachoma cases. The agents differed morphologically from agents of Arakawa and Kitamura and possessed a lower immunogenic activity. Studies on morphology, antigenic structure and toxic ability of the agents showed their relationship to ornithosis-lymphogranuloma group of viruses. Comparative studies of biological properties of the latter and agents isolated from trachoma cases E.G., pathogenicity range, complement fixation test, neutralization test, toxicity neutralization test, cross protection test in vaccinated mice and results of intradermal allergic tests in trachoma patients, showed independence of the agents as a species and their eti-ological role in trachoma. In 1960-61 viral agents adapted to chick embryo yolk sac were isolated from trachoma cases. As the result of obtaining the classical Koch triad (isolation of laboratory culture, reproduction of typical experimental infection on author's own eye and repeated isolations of virus from the infected eye) one of the agents was decisively identified as trachoma agent, strain "AB". According to available literature data, the strain differs from Tan Fei-fan's virus in its pathogenicity range for laboratory animals and is closely related to the trachoma strain "G-I" of Collier and other. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19634100023707

Acta Veterinaria (Beograd)				8	3			25	34						1958	1958	During 1956-57, several cats in Belgrade became infected, probably from ingestion of infected pig viscera. Experimentally it was possible to infect laboratory rodents and cats by the skin and oral mucosa, but infection by oral administration of virus was rare. Pruritus occurred at the site of experimental infection. Dilatation of the pupil was observed in the eye nearest to the site of infection. Bilateral dilatation following unilateral dilatation was indicative of imminent death. In experimentally infected cats the number of leukocytes doubled during the incubation period and continued to increase in the course of the disease. Similarly, sugar content of blood and cerebrospinal fluid began to increase during the incubation period and became highest during the clinical stages, c.s.f. always having the higher sugar content.-E.G.

The emergence of NAI-resistant variants of H7N9viruses with an NA R292K mutation poses a therapeutic challenge. A comprehensive understanding of the susceptibility of these viruses to clinically available NAIs, non-NAIs and their combinations is crucial for effective treatment. In this study, by using limited serial passage and plaque purification, an R292K variant of the Anhui1 lineage was isolated from a patient with clinical evidence of resistance to oseltamivir. In vitro and cell-based assays confirmed a high level of resistance conferred by the R292K mutation to oseltamivir carboxylate and a moderate level of resistance to zanamivir and peramivir. Non-NAI antivirals, such as T-705, ribavirin and NT-300, efficiently inhibited both the variant and the wild-type in cell-based assays. A combination of NAIs and non-NAIs did not exhibit a marked synergistic effect against the R292K variant. However, the combination of two non-NAIs ( T-705 and ribavirin) exhibited significant synergism against the mutant virus. In experimentally infected mice, the variant showed delayed onset of symptoms, a reduced viral load and attenuated lethality compared with the wild-type. Our study suggested non-NAIs should be tested clinically for H7N9 patients with a sustained high viral load. Possible drug combination regimens, such as T-705 plus ribavirin, should be further tested in animal models. The pathogenicity and transmissibility of the R292K H7N9 variant should be further assessed with genetically well-characterized pairs of viruses and, most-desirably, with competitive fitness experiments.

The situation in mice is less clear. Reports concluding that LAT null mutants reactivate poorly in the mouse explant-induced reactivation (EIR) model are contradicted by a similar number of reports of normal EIR of LAT(-) mutants in mice. To determine if the EIR phenotype might be mouse strain-dependent we infected BALB/c and Swiss Webster mice with LAT(-) or LAT(+) virus and assessed EIR in individual trigeminal ganglia. Compared to LAT(+) virus, LAT(-) virus reactivated poorly in Swiss Webster mice (P < 0.05). In contrast, the EIR phenotype of these viruses was similar in BALB/c mice (P > 0.1). Thus, LAT appeared to have a much greater impact on the EIR phenotype in Swiss Webster mice than in BALB/c mice. The mouse strain therefore appeared consequential in the HSV-1 EIR phenotype in mice.																					WOS:000168289100015	11297686

Hendra virus and Nipah virus animal vaccines								VACCINE				34	30			3525	3534		10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.03.075				JUN 24 2016	2016	Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are zoonotic viruses that emerged in the mid to late 1990s causing disease outbreaks in livestock and people. HeV appeared in Queensland, Australia in 1994 causing a severe respiratory disease in horses along with a human case fatality. NiV emerged a few years later in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-1999 causing a large outbreak of encephalitis with high mortality in people and also respiratory disease in pigs which served as amplifying hosts. The key pathological elements of HeV and NiV infection in several species of mammals, and also in people, are a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. In people, both HeV and NiV are also capable of causing relapsed encephalitis following recovery from an acute infection. The known reservoir hosts of HeV and NiV are several species of pteropid fruit bats. Spillovers of HeV into horses continue to occur in Australia and NiV has caused outbreaks in people in Bangladesh and India nearly annually since 2001, making HeV and NiV important transboundary biological threats. NiV in particular possesses several features that underscore its potential as a pandemic threat, including its ability to infect humans directly from natural reservoirs or indirectly from other susceptible animals, along with a capacity of limited human-to-human transmission. Several HeV and NiV animal challenge models have been developed which have facilitated an understanding of pathogenesis and allowed for the successful development of both active and passive immunization countermeasures.

Interleukin-18 and cytotoxic impairment are independent and synergistic causes of murine virus-induced hyperinflammation								BLOOD				136	19			2162	2174		10.1182/blood.2019003846				NOV 5 2020	2020	Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) are life-threatening hyperinflammatory syndromes typically associated with underlying hematologic and rheumatic diseases, respectively. Familial HLH is associated with genetic cytotoxic impairment and thereby to excessive antigen presentation. Extreme elevation of serum interleukin-18 (IL-18) has been observed specifically in patients with MAS, making it a promising therapeutic target, but how IL-18 promotes hyperinflammation remains unknown. In an adjuvant-induced MAS model, excess IL-18 promoted immunopathology, whereas perforin deficiency had no effect. To determine the effects of excess IL-18 on virus-induced immunopathology, we infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV; strain Armstrong). LCMV infection is self-limited in wild-type mice, but Prf1(-/-) mice develop prolonged viremia and fatal HLH. LCMV-infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice developed cachexia and hyperinflammation comparable to Prf1(-/-) mice, albeit with minimal mortality. Like Prf1(-/-) mice, immunopathology was largely rescued by CD8 depletion or interferon-gamma (IFNg) blockade. Unlike Prf1(-/-) mice, they showed normal target cell killing and normal clearance of viral RNA and antigens. Rather than impairing cytotoxicity, excess IL-18 acted on T lymphocytes to amplify their inflammatory responses. Surprisingly, combined perforin deficiency and transgenic IL-18 production caused spontaneous hyperinflammation specifically characterized by CD8 T-cell expansion and improved by IFNg blockade. Even Il18tg;Prf1-haplosufficient mice demonstrated hyperinflammatory features. Thus, excess IL-18 promotes hyperinflammation via an autoinflammatory mechanism distinct from, and synergistic with, cytotoxic impairment. These data establish IL-18 as a potent, independent, and modifiable driver of life-threatening innate and adaptive hyperinflammation and support the rationale for an IL-18-driven subclass of hyperinflammation.

An experimental study on histopathological lesions of Iranian isolates of influenza A (H9N2) virus in BALB/C mouse.								Journal of Veterinary Research				65	3			231	267						2010	2010	Avian influenza H9N2 viruses are circulating in domestic poultry worldwide. Although this avian subtype is generally not highly pathogenic for avian species, these viruses have recently been transmitted to mammalian species, including humans. So this study has been done to prescribe the pathologic lesions of this virus in BALB/C mouse as a mammalian model. We infected 25 female BALB/C mice with 50 l of 106EID50 of virus per 50 l chorioalantoic fluid. 25 mice as control group received only 50 l of uninfected chorioalantoic fluid. Sampling was done on days 3, 6, 9 and 12 post infection. The following tissues were examined by light microscopy for the presence of lesions and for the detection of Influenza viral antigen (Immunohistochemistry): lungs, trachea, brain, liver, intestine, spleen, kidneys and heart. Histopathologic studies revealed that this virus only can induce local lesions in lung and trachea in the form of interstitial bronchopneumonia and tracheitis. However these findings showed that Influenza A H9N2 viruses are potential to infect mammals but severity of the lesions differ from sub type to sub type. As the human health have now gained importance, both for illness and fatalities that have occurred following natural infection with avian viruses, and for the potential of generating a reassortant virus that could give rise to the next human influenza pandemic, more consideration and prevention should be applied.

Diet-induced obesity prolongs neuroinflammation and recruits CCR2(+) monocytes to the brain following herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 latency in mice								BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY				57				68	78		10.1016/j.bbi.2016.06.007				OCT 2016	2016	Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 is a ubiquitous human infection, with increased prevalence in obese populations. Obesity has been linked to increased inflammation, susceptibility to infection, and higher rates of anxiety disorder and cognitive impairment. To determine how obesity alters neuroinflammation and behavior following infection, we infected weanling C57BL/6 or CCR2(RFP/+)/CX3CR1(GFP/+) mice with a very low dose of HSV-1. Following viral latency (14 days post infection (d p.i.)), mice were randomly assigned to remain on the low fat (LF) diet or switched to a 45% high fat (HF) diet. Eight weeks post diet shift, latently infected mice on the HF diet (HSV-HF) had greater microglial activation and infiltration of inflammatory CCR2(+) monocytes in the hypothalamus and dentate gyrus, in comparison to both HSV-LF mice and uninfected mice on LF and HF diets. VCAM staining was present in hypothalamus and hippocampus of the HSV-HF mice in the areas of monocyte infiltration. Infiltrating monocytes also produced pro-inflammatory cytokines demonstrating that, along with activated microglia, monocytes contribute to sustained neuroinflammation in latently infected obese mice. Utilizing a light-dark preference test, we found that HSV-HF mice had increased anxiety-like behavior. In the marble-burying test, HF diet and HSV infection resulted in increased numbers of buried marbles. Together, these mice provide a useful, testable model to study the biobehavioral effects of obesity and latent HSV-1 infection in regards to anxiety and may provide a tool for studying diet intervention programs in the future.

Introducing the rabies tissue culture infection test (RTCIT), that serves to multiply the virus into cell culture may improve and reduce laboratory procedure time. In our examination we managed to detect the virus in naturally and experimentally infected animals. The method proved to be as efficient as the mouse inoculation test, but its results could be obtained more rapidly. The advantages and limitations of the test are discussed in this article.																					WOS:000077303500007

The dose-dependence of the production of IFN showed a direct relation of the extract to interferon induction. There is strong evidence for that the extract can decrease the antigenic and infective activity of HCV in both in vitro experiments and HCV-induced infection in mice.

In suspensions of ticks exposed as larvae to viremic mice, the ELISA detected 13% positive as compared to 3% (n = 721) positive by plaque-assay. Adult ticks inoculated with virus and sampled up to 102 days later were 84% positive by ELISA compared to 36% (n = 273) positive by plaque-assay. The two tests detected similar proportions of positive ticks in the two weeks immediately after viral inoculation; however, the ELISA was positive in 100% of inoculated adult ticks from 18-102 days post-inoculation while the plaque-assay was positive in 33% (n = 135) of the same specimens. CCHF viral antigen was detected in 10% (n = 101) of first-generation progeny tested as unfed larva pools by ELISA, yet no virus was detected by plaque-assay, indicating that either non-infective viral fragments or very low levels of live virus were detected by ELISA in these tick progeny. As detected by plaque assay, virus inoculated unfed adult ticks were virtually all infected by day 8 post-inoculation; by day 21 post-inoculation only 33% were detected as positive. A cohort of these ticks were allowed to blood feed from day 21-31 post-inoculation. When assayed after feeding all female ticks and nearly 50% of male ticks were detected as virus-positive. This indicates that the virus likely persisted in the unfed ticks below the level of detectability of the plaque-assay and increased in the blood fed ticks up to a detectable level. The ELISA however, detected 100% of ticks as virus-positive from day 14 post-inoculation throughout the remainder of the study, regardless of feeding status (day 102 post-inoculation). These results indicate that antigen-detection ELISA is more sensitive in detecting CCHF virus in ticks than plaque-assay. Since an infected tick remains antigen-positive by ELISA for possibly the remainder of its life, this assay will be a major improvement in field surveys and vector competency studies of ticks for CCHF virus.

Viral titers of recombinant E119G and Q136K mutants were significantly lower than those of the WT in the first 36 h postinoculation (p.i.) in vitro. The E119G and Q136K mutations were both associated with a significant reduction of total neuraminidase (NA) activity at the cell surface of 293T cells, with relative total NA activities of 14% (P < 0.01) and 20% (P< 0.01), respectively, compared to the WT. The E119G mutation significantly reduced the affinity (8-fold increase in Km) but not the V-max. The Q136K mutation increased the affinity (5-fold decrease in Km) with a reduction in Vmax (8% Vmax ratio versus the WT). In mice, infection with the E119G and Q136K mutants resulted in lung viral titers that were significantly lower than those of the WT on days 3 p.i. (3.4 x 106 x 0.8 x 10(6) and 2.1 x 10(7) x 0.4 x 10(7) PFU/ml, respectively, versus 8.8 x 10(7) x 1.1 x 10(7); P< 0.05) and 6 p.i. (3.0 x 105 +/- 0.5 x 105 and 8.6 x 10(5) +/- 1.4 x 105 PFU/ml, respectively, versus 5.8 x 107 x 0.3 x 107; P< 0.01). In experimentally infected ferrets, the E119G mutation rapidly reverted to the WT in donor and contact animals. The Q136K mutation was maintained in ferrets, although nasal wash viral titers from the Q136K contact group were significantly lower than those of the WT on days 3 to 5 p.i. Our results demonstrate that zanamivir-resistant E119G and Q136K mutations compromise viral fitness and transmissibility in A(H1N1) pdm09 viruses.																					WOS:000316119100031	23357777	
C	Ma, ZengJie; Wang, Yigang; Li, Yukun			IEEE					Processing of three-dimensional models for the crystal laser engraving								PROCEEDINGS NICOGRAPH INTERNATIONAL 2016								112	115		10.1109/NicoInt.2016.21				2016	2016	With the development of crystal laser engraving technology and the improvement of the appreciation level of art works, the new customized 3D (three-dimensional) art expression of laser crystal engraving has received more and more attention. In this paper, we propose some 3D model processing methods for the crystal laser engraving. Firstly, to get densely vertices for laser engraving, we subdivide the mesh based on modified Butterfly subdivision method. Secondly, in order to keep distance of vertices not less than safety distance of laser engraving, we put forward a simplification algorithm suitable for laser engraving models, collapse edges which do not conform to the safe distance limit of the vertex. Finally, to show the rich details of the model by point cloud density, we propose the filtering algorithm of point cloud model based on multi-level error diffusion. Experiments show the proposed algorithms have higher practicability.					15th Nicograph International Conference (NicoInt)15th Nicograph International Conference (NicoInt)	JUL 06-08, 2016JUL 06-08, 2016	IIEEJ; Soc Sci & ArtIIEEJ; Soc Sci & Art	Hangzhou Dianzi Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINAHangzhou Dianzi Univ, Hangzhou, PEOPLES R CHINA													WOS:000389249400021

Endogenous Murine BST-2/Tetherin Is Not a Major Restriction Factor of Influenza A Virus Infection								PLOS ONE				10	11					e0142925	10.1371/journal.pone.0142925				NOV 13 2015	2015	BST-2 (tetherin, CD317, HM1.24) restricts virus growth by tethering enveloped viruses to the cell surface. The role of BST-2 during influenza A virus infection (IAV) is controversial. Here, we assessed the capacity of endogenous BST-2 to restrict IAV in primary murine cells. IAV infection increased BST-2 surface expression by primary macrophages, but not alveolar epithelial cells (AEC). BST-2-deficient AEC and macrophages displayed no difference in susceptibility to IAV infection relative to wild type cells. Furthermore, BST-2 played little role in infectious IAV release from either AEC or macrophages. To examine BST-2 during IAV infection in vivo, we infected BST-2-deficient mice. No difference in weight loss or in viral loads in the lungs and/or nasal tissues were detected between BST-2-deficient and wild type animals. This study rules out a major role for endogenous BST-2 in modulating IAV in the mouse model of infection.																					WOS:000367628500071	26566124

Virus was isolated from an outbreak of lethal disease in red squirrels in the north-east of England. Experimental infection of captive-bred red squirrels confirmed that this virus was the cause of the severe skin lesions observed. Electron microscopic examination of the virus showed that it had a morphology typical of parapoxviruses whilst preliminary sequence data suggested a genomic G + C composition of approximately 66%, again similar to that found in other parapoxviruses. However Southern hybridization analysis failed to detect three known parapoxvirus genes, two of which have been found so far only in the genus Parapoxvirus. Comparative sequence analysis of two other genes, conserved across the eight recognized chordopoxvirus genera, suggests that the squirrel virus represents a previously unrecognized genus of the Chordopoxviridae.

The gut microbiome, which includes bacteria, viruses, and fungi, contributes to this environmental influence, and can induce immunological changes. The gut viral component of the microbiome, related to T1D has mostly focused on coxsackieviruses and rotavirus. The role of norovirus, another common enteric virus, in susceptibility to T1D was hitherto unknown. Norovirus is highly infectious and encountered by many children. We studied the mouse norovirus 4 (MNV4), related to human noroviruses, in the Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model, to determine its role in influencing susceptibility to T1D. We infected MNV-free NOD mice with MNV4 by exposing the mice to MNV4-positive bedding from an endemically-infected mouse colony to mimic a natural infection. Control MNV-free NOD mice were exposed to MNV-free bedding from the same colony. Interestingly, MNV4 infection protected NOD mice from the development of T1D and was associated with an expansion of Tregs and reduced proinflammatory T cells. We also found MNV4 significantly modified the gut commensal bacteria composition, promoting increased alpha-diversity and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. To elucidate whether T1D protection was directly related to MNV4, or indirectly through modulating gut microbiota, we colonized germ-free (GF) NOD mice with the MNV4-containing or non-MNV4-containing viral filtrate, isolated from filtered fecal material. We found that MNV4 induced significant changes in mucosal immunity, including altered Tuft cell markers, cytokine secretion, antiviral immune signaling markers, and the concentration of mucosal antibodies. Systemically, MNV4-infection altered the immune cells including B cell subsets, macrophages and T cells, and especially induced an increase in Treg number and function. Furthermore, in vitro primary exposure of the norovirus filtrate to naive splenocytes identified significant increases in the proportion of activated and CTLA4-expressing Tregs. Our data provide novel knowledge that norovirus can protect NOD mice from T1D development by inducing the expansion of Tregs and reducing inflammatory T cells. Our study also highlights the importance of distinguishing the mucosal immunity mediated by bacteria from that by enteric viruses.

Platelet-Activating Factor Receptor Plays a Role in Lung Injury and Death Caused by Influenza A in Mice								PLOS PATHOGENS				6	11					e1001171	10.1371/journal.ppat.1001171				NOV 2010	2010	Influenza A virus causes annual epidemics which affect millions of people worldwide. A recent Influenza pandemic brought new awareness over the health impact of the disease. It is thought that a severe inflammatory response against the virus contributes to disease severity and death. Therefore, modulating the effects of inflammatory mediators may represent a new therapy against Influenza infection. Platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR) deficient mice were used to evaluate the role of the gene in a model of experimental infection with Influenza A/WSN/33 H1N1 or a reassortant Influenza A H3N1 subtype. The following parameters were evaluated: lethality, cell recruitment to the airways, lung pathology, viral titers and cytokine levels in lungs. The PAFR antagonist PCA4248 was also used after the onset of flu symptoms. Absence or antagonism of PAFR caused significant protection against flu-associated lethality and lung injury. Protection was correlated with decreased neutrophil recruitment, lung edema, vascular permeability and injury. There was no increase of viral load and greater recruitment of NK1.1(+) cells. Antibody responses were similar in WT and PAFR-deficient mice and animals were protected from re-infection. Influenza infection induces the enzyme that synthesizes PAF, lyso-PAF acetyltransferase, an effect linked to activation of TLR7/8. Therefore, it is suggested that PAFR is a disease-associated gene and plays an important role in driving neutrophil influx and lung damage after infection of mice with two subtypes of Influenza A. Further studies should investigate whether targeting PAFR may be useful to reduce lung pathology associated with Influenza A virus infection in humans.

Doklady, Biological Sciences				354	1/6			246	249						1997	1997	Ixodes persulcatus were collected from a natural focus of Borrelia afzelii and B. garinii near St. Petersburg, Russia, and from a Borrelia and tickborne encephalitis (TBE) virus-free area near Moscow. Laboratory-raised I. persulcatus, I. ricinus and Dermacentor reticulatus artificially infected with TBE were also used. The ticks were allowed to feed on mice, and at various times after attachment ticks, their cement feeding cones and a small piece of skin were removed for analysis. The mice were examined for any pathogen infection, and the cones, abdomens (middle intestine) and anterior parts of the body (salivary glands) were examined for Borrelia. The amount of TBE virus in the cement cone, liquid saliva, the total tick body, and the blood of mice to which the ticks had attached was also determined. It was seen that the concentration of TBE virus in the cement cone was sometimes equal to or higher than that for the total tick body 1 day after attachment. The titre of virus in the saliva was very low compared with these. In I. ricinus and D. reticulatus the maximum virus concentration in the cement cone was reached within hours or, in some cases, minutes of attachment. The rate of accumulation was slower in secondary carriers. Removal of the tick without removal of the cement cone did not prevent infection, even if the cone was then removed <1 h after the tick had attached. Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. was found in only some of the cement cones and only then after several hours of attachment. Transmission of Borrelia to and from the host mice is discussed. Only 62.5% of the female ticks placed on mice attached.																					CABI:19980502704

The susceptibility of the dog to Q fever								AUSTRALIAN JOUR EXP BIOL AND MED SCI				16	(3)			245	248		10.1038/icb.1938.27				1938	1938	Two fox terriers were inoculated with Q virus in the form of infected guinea-pig liver. The first dog reacted with 3 days of fever. Q virus was obtained by guinea-pig inoculation from its blood and spleen. The 2d dog reacted with 1 day of fever, but the virus was not recovered from its blood. The dog is therefore susceptible to Q fever, and forms a potential reservoir of infection, but probably does not play an important part in natural transmission. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: E. H.

For this purpose, we used various knockout mice lacking molecules, which include interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interferon-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma-R), interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and perforin, We also used mutant mice lacking Fas molecule. When we infected these mice with MCMV and determined the viral titers in their lungs at different time points, we found that IFN-gamma, IFN-gamma-R, IRF-1, iNOS, and perforin-deficient mice developed significantly higher titers of infectious MCMV in the lung, compared to those observed in their respective wild-type controls. In the lungs of Fas-mutant mice, viral titers were similar to those obtained in wild-type mice.																					WOS:000089545900004	11016594

A recent Influenza pandemic brought new awareness over the health impact of the disease. It is thought that a severe inflammatory response against the virus contributes to disease severity and death. Therefore, modulating the effects of inflammatory mediators may represent a new therapy against Influenza infection. Platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor (PAFR) deficient mice were used to evaluate the role of the gene in a model of experimental infection with Influenza A/WSN/33 H1N1 or a reassortant Influenza A H3N1 subtype. The following parameters were evaluated: lethality, cell recruitment to the airways, lung pathology, viral titers and cytokine levels in lungs. The PAFR antagonist PCA4248 was also used after the onset of flu symptoms. Absence or antagonism of PAFR caused significant protection against flu-associated lethality and lung injury. Protection was correlated with decreased neutrophil recruitment, lung edema, vascular permeability and injury. There was no increase of viral load and greater recruitment of NK1.1+ cells. Antibody responses were similar in WT and PAFR-deficient mice and animals were protected from re-infection. Influenza infection induces the enzyme that synthesizes PAF, lyso-PAF acetyltransferase, an effect linked to activation of TLR7/8. Therefore, it is suggested that PAFR is a disease-associated gene and plays an important role in driving neutrophil influx and lung damage after infection of mice with two subtypes of Influenza A. Further studies should investigate whether targeting PAFR may be useful to reduce lung pathology associated with Influenza A virus infection in humans.

Evolutionary selection for MHC molecules that effectively clear infectious agents provides an advantage to humans. However, certain class II molecules are associated with autoimmune diseases. In this study we infected autoimmune-susceptible DRB1*0401.AEo and non-susceptible *0402.AEo mice with H1N1 influenza and determined clearance and protective immunity to H3N2 virus. *0401 mice generated a robust TLR-triggered immune response and cleared H1N1 influenza virus infection. After vaccination and challenge with H1N1, *0401 mice, when challenged with H3N2, generated cross-protective immunity to heterosubtypic H3N2 influenza strain whereas *0402 mice cleared the H1N1 infection but did not generate cross-protective immunity against the H3N2 influenza strain. The intracellular trafficking route of MHCII revealed that *0401 molecules traffic through the late endosome/lysosomes while *0402 molecules traffic into early endosomes. This suggested that trafficking of MHCII could affect the functional output of the innate immune response and clearance of viral infections. Also, DRB1*0401 mice live longer than HLA-DRB1*0402 mice. The study provides a potential hypothesis for evolutionary selection of *0401 molecule, even though it is associated with autoreactivity, which may be dependent on the availability of peptide repertoire of self-antigens.

Here we show that MxA protein interferes with VSV mRNA synthesis. Transfected Swiss 3T3 mouse cells constitutively expressing MxA protein and control cells were infected with VSV, and viral RNA and protein synthesis was monitored. Viral macromolecules were very abundant in control cells at 4 h postinfection, whereas the pools of VSV proteins and RNAs were more than 50-fold reduced in cells expressing MxA. To determine whether MxA inhibited VSV primary transcription, we infected the cells in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide and measured the pools of the five viral mRNAs at 4 h postinfection. VSV L mRNA concentration was more than 20-fold reduced, VSV G mRNA concentration was about 10-fold reduced, and the other viral mRNAs were three- to fivefold less abundant in MxA-expressing cells than in control cells. Our results thus indicate that MxA interferes with normal VSV mRNA synthesis either directly by inhibiting the activity of the viral polymerase complex or indirectly by reducing the stability of the VSV mRNAs.

Comparative study of hemostasis and cytokine production in experimental Dengue virus infection								Voprosy Virusologii				52	2			32	36						MAR-APR 2007	2007	Some parameters of hemostasis and cytokine production during the fatal and nonfatal course of experimental human versus murine infection caused by Dengue virus (DV) were studied. Its lethal dose administration induced a rapid development of anemia, thrombocytopenia and a change in packed cell volume. These changes were not so profound in the nonfatal group of infected mice. There was an excess production of both proinflammatory (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta) and anti-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-10) cytokines in the fatal group. In mice of this group, the early rise of IFN-gamma and IL-1 2 corresponded to the parameters observed in patients with severe forms of DV infection. The findings provide evidence that the proposed model may be used for the experimental study of the immunopathogenesis of the disease.																					BCI:BCI200700442686	17500237

Bulletin de l'Academie Veterinaire de France				48	2/3			107	111						1975	1975	It has previously been shown that i/d injection of guinea-pigs with purified chlamydial antigen mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant induces a delayed hypersensitivity as revealed by a second i/d injection 8 days later. This hypersensitivity can be transferred to a normal guinea-pig by i/p injection of a suspension of ganglia from the sensitized guinea-pig. An attempt was made to adapt this technique to chlamydia infection, employing groups each of 3 guinea-pigs. The first group received an i/d plantar injection of Freund's complete adjuvant, the second an i/d plantar injection of a mixture of concentrated chlamydial antigen and Freund's complete adjuvant, and the third an equal mixture of an antigen prepared from a culture in embryonic calf kidney cells of IBR virus and Freund's complete adjuvant. In the following weeks each guinea-pig received every 8 days an i/d injection of the antigen used for the first group. Further details of the technique and the principles involved are given. In a preliminary trial it was shown that neither of the two antigens tested provoke inhibition of the guinea-pig macrophages if not previously sensitized by i/d inoculation of the same antigen. The inhibition reaction of the migration in vitro of the guinea-pig macrophages sensitized by chlamydial antigen showed this reaction to be intense and specific, demonstrating the importance in experimental infection with the chlamydia of ovine abortion of the cellular immune reaction in relation to the humoral response.

J	Kawana, R								Cardiovascular diseases due to viruses.								Heart and vessels. Supplement				1				91	6		10.1007/BF02072370				1985	1985	In acute myocardiopathy and pericardiopathy, Coxsackie virus B infections are increasingly recognized as a cause of primary myocardial disease and may cause chronic cardiovascular disease. With other viruses, such as cytomegaloviruses and rubella virus, transplacental infection during pregnancy may occur, and this can cause the congenital rubella syndrome, which involves heart abnormalities. Other viruses are now under study. Myocarditis was observed in a newborn infant infected with Coxsackie virus B3, which was isolated by tissue culture methods. Experimental infection of Coxsackie virus A and B was studied in suckling mice and the histopathologic changes in heart muscle were observed. Laboratory findings of viral infection are very useful for clinical diagnosis, however care needs to be taken with respect to the obtaining of specimens, diagnostic procedures, and the assessment of results.

We simultaneously exposed encapsulated molluscan embryos to three abiotic stressors-acidified conditions, elevated temperate, and solar UV radiation in large outdoor water tables in a multifactorial design. Solar UV radiation was modified with plastic filters, while levels of the other factors reflected IPCC predictions for near-future change. We quantified mortality and the rate of embryonic development for a mid-shore littorinid, Bembicium nanum, and low-shore opisthobranch, Dolabrifera brazieri. Outcomes were consistent for these model species with embryos faring significantly better at 26 degrees C than 22 degrees C. Mortality sharply increased at the lowest temperature (22 degrees C) and lowest pH (7.6) examined, producing a significant interaction. Under these conditions mortality approached 100% for each species, representing a 2- to 4-fold increase in mortality relative to warm (26 degrees C) non-acidified conditions. Predictably, development was more rapid at the highest temperature but this again interacted with acidified conditions. Development was slowed under acidified conditions at the lowest temperature. The presence of UV radiation had minimal impact on the outcomes, only slowing development for the littorinid and not interacting with the other factors. Our findings suggest that a warming ocean, at least to a threshold, may compensate for the effects of decreasing pH for some species. It also appears that stressors will interact in complex and unpredictable ways in a changing climate.																					WOS:000315153400183	23741396

Manufacturing processes for the biologics using bovine materials have the risk of viral contamination. Therefore viral validation is essential in ensuring the safety of the products. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus(BVDV) is the most common bovine pathogen and has widely been known as a contaminant of biologics. In order to establish the validation system for the BVDV safety of biologics, a real-time RT-PCR method was developed for quantitative detection of BVDV contamination in raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products. Specific primers for amplification of BVDV RNA was selected, and BVDV RNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green I. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 1 TCID50/mL. The real-time RT-PCR method was validated to be reproducible and very specific to BVDV. The established real-time RTPCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with BVDV. BVDV RNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culture supernatant. Also the real-time RT-PCR assay could detect 10 TCID50/mL of BVDV artificially contaminated in bovine collagen.																					KJD:ART001239288

R	Marcelin, Anne-Genevieve; Lambert-Niclot, Sidonie; Petit, Nicolas Y; Garcia, Sylvie; Marodon, Gilles								HIV Replication Is Not Controlled by CD8+ T Cells during the Acute Phase of the Infection in Humanized Mice								Figshare															2016-01-14	2015	HIV replication follows a well-defined pattern during the acute phase of the infection in humans. After reaching a peak during the first few weeks after infection, viral replication resolves to a set-point thereafter. There are still uncertainties regarding the contribution of CD8+ T cells in establishing this set-point. An alternative explanation, supported by in silico modeling, would imply that viral replication is limited by the number of available targets for infection, i.e. CD4+CCR5+ T cells. Here, we used NOD.SCID.gc-/- mice bearing human CD4+CCR5+ and CD8+ T cells derived from CD34+ progenitors to investigate the relative contribution of both in viral control after the peak. Using low dose of a CCR5-tropic HIV virus, we observed an increase in viral replication followed by &#8220;spontaneous&#8221; resolution of the peak, similar to humans. To rule out any possible role for CD8+ T cells in viral control, we infected mice in which CD8+ T cells had been removed by a depleting antibody. Globally, viral replication was not affected by the absence of CD8+ T cells. Strikingly, resolution of the viral peak was equally observed in mice with or without CD8+ T cells, showing that CD8+ T cells were not involved in viral control in the early phase of the infection. In contrast, a marked and specific loss of CCR5-expressing CD4+ T cells was observed in the spleen and in the bone marrow, but not in the blood, of infected animals. Our results strongly suggest that viral replication during the acute phase of the infection in humanized mice is mainly constrained by the number of available targets in lymphoid tissues rather than by CD8+ T cells.

Cell cultures (lung and kidney) established from transgenic and control mice showed that although both could be infected only those from the CD46+ mice gave fusion. A complete round of replication with the release of infectious virus was detected exclusively in the transgenic cell cultures whose permissiveness to MV was markedly less than that of Vero cells. The ability of MV to replicate in vivo in mice was studied using both vaccine and laboratory-adapted wild type strains of virus. After intraperitoneal and intranasal inoculations of transgenic mice, virus replication could not be detected. In contrast intracerebral inoculation induced infection in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice, Our results from in vitro infection studies support the hypothesis that CD46 is a major host cell factor involved in the MV-induced fusion process and MV entry The studies further indicate that MV tropism is not governed solely by the expression of the CD46 gene and that the high efficiency of the replicative cycles characteristic of fully permissive host cells requires additional factors, which are lacking in both transgenic and nontransgenic mice.

J	Cho, Hang Mee; Lee, Dong Hyuck; Kim, Hyun Mi; Kim, In Seop								Real-time RT-PCR for quantitative detection of bovine vital diarrhoea virus during manufacture of biologics								Korean Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology				36	1			34	42						MAR 2008	2008	Bovine blood, cell, tissue, and organ are used as raw materials for manufacturing biologics such as biopharmaceuticals, tissue engineered products, and cell therapy. Manufacturing processes for the biologics using bovine materials have the risk of viral contamination. Therefore viral validation is essential in ensuring the safety of the products. Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) is the most common bovine pathogen and has widely been known as a contaminant of biologics. In order to establish the validation system for the BVDV safety of biologics, a real-time RT-PCR method was developed for quantitative detection of BVDV contamination in raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products. Specific primers for amplification of BVDV RNA was selected, and BVDV RNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green I. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 1 TCID50/mL. The real-time RT-PCR method was validated to be reproducible and very specific to BVDV. The established real-time RTPCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with BVDV BVDV RNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culture supernatant. Also the real-time RT-PCR assay could detect 10 TCID50/mL of BVDV artificially contaminated in bovine collagen.																					BCI:BCI200800326667

To test this idea, we infected healthy WT and lupus-prone B6. Sle123 mice with an EBV-related and rodent-specific gammaherpesvirus,.HV68. Although acute gamma HV68 infection increased autoantibody levels for 4 to 6 wk, latent infection inhibited these responses for 1 y. The inhibition of autoantibody expression was only observed in B6.Sle123 females and not in males, which already displayed lower autoantibody titers. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, infection of young B6.Sle123 mice, both male and female, resulted in suppression of lymphoid activation and expansion and of glomerular inflammation and sclerosis, preserving kidney function. Moreover, gamma HV68 infection led to reduced autoantibody titers, lymphoid activation, and glomerular inflammation whether lupus-prone females were infected before or during disease manifestation. Finally,.HV68 infection also inhibited autoantibody production in the genetically distinct MRL/lpr lupus-prone mice. Our findings indicate that gamma HV68 infection strongly inhibits the development and progression of lupus-like disease in mice that spontaneously develop this condition mediating its beneficial effects at the humoral, cellular, and organ levels. The mechanisms by which the virus exerts this down-modulatory action are not yet clear, but appear to operate via reduced activation of dendritic cells, T cells, and B cells. Gammaherpesviruses coevolved with the vertebrate immune systems, establishing lifelong infections in humans and other mammals. Our findings that gamma HV68 infection prevents rather than exacerbates autoimmunity in mice suggest that infection with gammaherpesviruses may be protective rather than pathological in most individuals.

Maximum response perturbation-based control of virus infection model with time-delays								RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL ANALYSIS AND MATHEMATICAL MODELLING				32	5			275	291		10.1515/rnam-2017-0027				OCT 2017	2017	A new method for constructing the multi-modal impacts on the immune systemin the chronic phase of viral infection, based on mathematical models formulated with delay-differential equations is proposed. The so called, optimal disturbances, widely used in the aerodynamic stability theory for mathematical models without delays are constructed for perturbing the steady states of the dynamical system for maximizing the perturbation-induced response. The concept of optimal disturbances is generalized on the systems with delayed argument. An algorithm for computing the optimal disturbances is developed for such systems. The elaborated computational technology is tested on a system of four nonlinear delay-differential equations which represents the model of experimental infection in mice caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. The steady-state perturbations resulting in a maximum response were computed with the proposed algorithm for two types of steady states characterized by a low and a high levels of viral load. The possibility of correction of the infection dynamics and the restoration of virus-specific lymphocyte functioning of the immune system by perturbing the steady states is demonstrated.

J	MATSUO S								EXPERIMENTAL VERTICAL INFECTION WITH RUBELLA VIRUS IN MICE								Tropical Medicine				17	2			47	54						1975	1975	To establish an animal model of the vertical infection with the rubella virus, experimental infection of mouse strain ICR was studied. On 3 or 7 days after mating, pregnant mice were inoculated with the Baylor R-1 strain of rubella virus i.m. or intranasally. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in all mothers and suckling mice and virus was isolated from placenta and spleen of 2 pregnant mice. Abnormalities and absorptions of fetuses in the uterus of infected mother mice and high mortality of newborns within 2 wk after birth were observed. The pregnant mouse is highly susceptible to experimental rubella infection, and should be valuable in studies of transplacental transmission.																					BCI:BCI197662055640

The aim of the present work was to analyze the ability of immune and RT-PCR techniques to detect viral components of three different serotypes, CV-A6, CV-A 13, and CV-A 14, in skeletal muscles of experimentally infected suckling mice.Material and methods. - The antigen detection was done by immunofluorescence technique on trypsinized muscular cells and by immunoperoxidase assay on frozen sections of skeletal muscle, using a monoclonal antibody directed towards a conserved epitope of the VP1 capsid protein among enteroviruses. The nested RT-PCR technique used primers located in the 5' non coding region of viral RNA.Results. - The group antigen was present in muscle cells of suckling mice infected by the three serotypes of CV-A which were assayed. Similarly, the muscle specimens were positive by nested RT-PCR. A kinetic study performed with CV-A13 and CV-A14 showed that the RT-PCR assay was positive as soon as 24 h after infection whereas the detection of VP1 antigen and symptoms of flask paralysis were observed only 48 and 72 h after infection, respectively.Conclusion. - These results show that the tested serotypes of CV-A can be easily detected in muscle specimens of suckling mice by using antigenic and molecular techniques currently available for the diagnosis of enterovirus infections.

J	Barbanti-Brodano, G; Sabbioni, S; Martini, F; Negrini, M; Corallini, A; Tognon, M								Simian virus 40 infection in humans and association with human diseases: results and hypotheses								VIROLOGY				318	1			1	9		10.1016/j.virol.2003.09.004				JAN 5 2004	2004	Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a monkey virus that was introduced in the human population by contaminated poliovaccines, produced in SV40-infected monkey cells.. between 1955 and 1963. Epidemiological evidence now suggests that SV40 may be contagiously transmitted in humans by horizontal infection, independent of the earlier administration of SV40-contaminated poliovaccines. This evidence includes detection of SV40 DNA sequences in human tissues and of SV40 antibodies in human sera, as well as rescue of infectious SV40 from a human tumor. Detection of SV40 DNA sequences in blood and sperm and of SV40 virions in sewage points to the hematic, sexual, and orofecal routes as means of virus transmission in humans. The site of latent infection in humans is not known, but the presence of SV40 in urine suggests the kidney as a possible site of latency, as it occurs in the natural monkey host. SV40 in humans is associated with inflammatory kidney diseases and with specific tumor types: mesothetioma, lymphoma, brain, and bone. These human tumors correspond to the neoplasms that are induced by SV40 experimental inoculation in rodents and by generation of transgenic mice with the SV40 early region gene directed by its own early promoter-enhancer. The mechanisms of SV40 tumorigenesis in humans are related to the properties of the two viral oncoproteins, the large T antigen (Tag) and the small t antigen (tag). Tag acts mainly by blocking the functions of p53 and RB tumor suppressor proteins, as well as by inducing chromosomal aberrations in the host cell. These chromosome alterations may hit genes important in oncogenesis and generate genetic instability in tumor cells. The clastogenic activity of Tag, which fixes the chromosome damage in the infected cells, may explain the low viral load in SV40-positive human tumors and the observation that Tag is expressed only in a fraction of tumor cells. "Hit and run" seems the most plausible mechanism to support this situation. The small tag, like large Tag, displays several functions, but its principal role in transformation is to bind the protein phosphatase PP2A. This leads to constitutive activation of the Wnt pathways resulting in continuous cell proliferation. The possibility that SV40 is implicated as a cofactor in the etiology of some human tumors has stimulated the preparation of a vaccine against the large Tag. Such a vaccine may represent in the future a useful immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic intervention against human tumors associated with SV40. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

J	Liu, Xing; Lv, Lin; Jiang, Chenlong; Bai, Juan; Gao, Yanni; Ma, Zicheng; Jiang, Ping								A natural product, (S)-10-Hydroxycamptothecin inhibits pseudorabies virus proliferation through DNA damage dependent antiviral innate immunity.								Veterinary microbiology				265				109313	109313		10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109313				2022-Feb	2022	Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a member of the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae, is one of the most important pathogenes that cause acute death in infected pigs and leads to substantial economic losses in the global swine industry. Recently, China's emerging PRV mutant strains resulted in the traditionally commercial vaccines not providing complete protection. Some studies reported that PRV could infect humans and cause endophthalmitis and encephalitis under certain circumstances. It is necessary to develop alternative manners to control the virus infection. Here, by screening a library of natural products, (S)-10-Hydroxycamptothecin (10-HCPT) was revealed to inhibit PRV replication with a selective index of 270.04. And 10-HCPT inhibited PRV replication by blocking the viral genome replication but not inhibiting the viral attachment, internalization, and release. RNA interference assay showed that 10-HCPT inhibited PRV replication by targeting DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1). Meanwhile, 10-HCPT treatment induced DNA damage response and stimulated antiviral innate immunity. Animal challenge experiments showed that 10-HCPT effectively alleviated clinical signs and hispathology, and increased INF-beta responses in lung and brain tissues of mice induced by PRV infection. The results demonstrate that 10-HCPT is a promising therapeutic agent to control PRV infection.																					MEDLINE:34968801	34968801

Inflammatory cell infiltrate is a common feature of HSV-1 infections and has been implicated in neurodegeneration. Therefore, viral recognition by innate immune receptors (i.e., TLR2) and the subsequent inflammatory response are now deemed key players in HSV-1 pathogenesis. In this study we infected with HSV-1 the enteric nervous system (ENS) of wild-type (WT) and TLR2 knock-out (TLR2(ko)) mice to investigate whether and how TLR2 participates in HSV-1 induced neuromuscular dysfunction. Our findings demonstrated viral specific transcripts suggestive of abortive replication in the ENS of both WT and TLR2(ko) mice. Moreover, HSV-1 triggered TLR2-MyD88 depend signaling in myenteric neurons and induced structural and functional alterations of the ENS. Gastrointestinal dysmotility was, however, less pronounced in TLR2(ko) as compared with WT mice. Interesting, HSV-1 caused up-regulation of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (CCL2) and recruitment of CD11b(+) macrophages in the myenteric ganglia of WT but not TLR2(ko) mice. At the opposite, the myenteric plexuses of TLR2ko mice were surrounded by a dense infiltration of HSV-1 reactive CD3(+) CD8(+)INF gamma(+) lymphocytes. Indeed, depletion CD3(+) CD8(+) cells by means of administration of anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody reduced neuromuscular dysfunction in TLR2(ko) mice infected with HSV-1. During HSV-1 infection, the engagement of TLR2 mediates production of CCL2 in infected neurons and coordinates macrophage recruitment. Bearing in mind these observations, blockage of TLR2 signaling could provide novel therapeutic strategies to support protective and specific T-cell responses and to improve neuromuscular dysfunction in pathogen-mediated alterations of the ENS.

J	Kim, Yoon-Won; Cho, Min-Kee								Viral inhibitory substance secreted from hybridoma								Journal of the Korean Society for Microbiology				31	1			75	85						1996	1996	The M variant of encephalomyocarditis(EMC-M) virus produces intermittently diabetes in mice by infecting and destroying pancreatic beta cells. One highly diabetogenic D variant(EMCD) and the other nondiabetogenic B variant(EMC-B) were isolated from EMC-M. EMC-D scarcely induces interferon, whereas EMC-B is a good inducer for interferon. In contrast to the biological differences, EMC-D and EMC-B are almost indistinguishable in several physicochemical and immunological properties. So the diabetogenicity of EMC virus was considered to be related to the ability of interferon induction. We isolated new variants EMC-DV(EMC-D3/1 and EMCD4/lB) from EMC-D. EMC-DV is neither diabetogenic nor inducing interferon. EMC-D is considered to have a attachment site to pancreatic beta cell with high affinity but EMC-DV and EMCB is to have the same attachment site with low affinity by single point mutation from EMC-D. However EMC-D, DV and B can be infected to beta cell in vivo and in vitro. These observations suggest that some mechanisms other than interferon and attachment system are involved in determining the ability of the viruses to infect and destroy beta cells. We presumed that EMC-B and EMC-DV induce some viral inhibitory factors from phagocytic cell or lymphocyte and then they are nondiabetogenic. We infected BALB/c mice with EMC-B and fused the splenocytes with myeloma cells. We obtained the hybridoma 12D8 releasing viral inhibitory substance(VIS) that must be neither immunoglobulin nor interferon. VIS had inhibitory effects on EMC-D at L(mouse fibroblast-like), BMP (baby mouse pancreas), Vero(African green monkey kidney), WI-38(human lung) and other cell lines. And VIS had inhibitory effects on EMC-D, EMC-B, coxsackie B4, reovirus and vesicular stomatitis virus at L cell. VIS appeared to act directly on host cell. VIS had strong preventive effect(100%) on diabetes induced with EMC-D at SJL/J and DBN/2N mice.																					BCI:BCI199699064214

We infected BMDMs and harvested RnA at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hpi while comparing changes in host gene expression compared to mock infected cells. Here, using a transcriptomics approach, we compared the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild type, DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response, predominantly involving type I interferons and a subset of interferon-responsive genes, within 12 hours after infection. In contrast, the wild type and DUBmut viruses stimulate the upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways and a proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in modulating the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivation of a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages and the disease process.

The EBV oncoproteins nuclear antigen 3A (EBNA3A) and 3C (EBNA3C) are required for B cell transformation in vitro and are expressed in EBV associated immunoblastic lymphomas in vivo. In order to address the necessity of EBNA3A and EBNA3C for persistent EBV infection in vivo, we infected NOD-scid gammacnull mice with reconstituted human immune system components (huNSG mice) with recombinant EBV mutants devoid of EBNA3A or EBNA3C expression. These EBV mutants established latent infection in secondary lymphoid organs of infected huNSG mice for at least 3 months, but did not cause tumor formation. Low level viral persistence in the absence of EBNA3A or EBNA3C seemed to be supported primarily by proliferation with the expression of early latent EBV gene products transitioning into absent viral protein expression without elevated lytic replication. In vitro, EBNA3A and EBNA3C deficient EBV infected B cells could be rescued from apoptosis through CD40 stimulation, mimicking T cell help in secondary lymphoid tissues. Thus, even in the absence of the oncogenes EBNA3A and 3C, EBV can access a latent gene expression pattern that is reminiscent of EBV persistence in healthy virus carriers without prior expression of its whole growth transforming program.

Serologic Prevalence of MPV1 in Mouse Strains in a Commercial Laboratory Mouse Colony Determined by Using VP1 Antigen								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE				49	4			437	442						JUL 2010	2010	A mouse parvovirus (designated MPV1f) was identified in a commercial laboratory mouse colony in Australia. The infection had not been detected by using an rNS1 parvovirus ELISA antigen even though the virus was genetically similar to other MPV1 variants reported previously. A recombinant biotinylated protein based on a truncated VP1 protein of the MPV1 strain was produced and used as antigen for ELISA and Western immunoblots to detect virus infection and determine the seroprevalence of infection in a colony of approximately 45,000 mice. Antibody-positive mice were detected in 8 of 11 rooms sampled, indicating that infection was widespread in the facility. Antibody was detected in 16.2% of 1161 sera obtained from 20 strains of mice. Seroprevalence varied among mouse strains, suggesting genetic variation in the susceptibility of mice to MPV1 or in their antibody response to infection, as has been reported previously in experimentally infected mice. Seroprevalence was high in some inbred strains, including DBA/2JArc and the random-bred strains Hsd:NIH and Arc:Arc(s). Antibody was not detected inC57BL/6J strains, and BALB/c strains showed low seroprevalence of MPV1f.																					WOS:000280537800009	20819389

Twenty-five eight-week-old Wistar rats housed in individual plastic cages were experimentally infected either with a Greek myocardial EMCV strain (5 rats with a 0.2x10(6) TCID50 dose per rat and 10 rats with a 0.5x104(-5) TCID50 dose per rat, oronasally) or a Belgian myocardial EMCV strain (10 rats with a 0.5x10(4.5) TCID50 dose per rat, oronasally). Two to five days later, each inoculated rat was moved to a new clean cage and coupled with a contact rat to compare the pathogenicity of the two strains and to estimate the basic reproduction ratio R-0, indicating the level of EMCV transmission. During the experiments, faecal virus excretion was measured as well as the serological response against EMCV. After euthanasia, virus isolation was attempted from different rat tissues. Neither strains produced mortality, nor clinical signs and only low titres of neutralising antibodies were found. All contact rats, however, Iwere infected and the virus was isolated from their faeces and from various tissues. Both 10-pair experiments,revealed a point estimate for the R-0 of infinity (95%-CI for both the Greek and Belgian EMCV strains=4.48-infinity), as did the 5-pair experiment with a higher dose of the Greek strain (95%-CI=1.93-infinity). Combining the results front the two 10-pair experiments resulted in an estimate for R-0 of infinity (95%-CI: 9.87-infinity). These results indicate that the EMC virus can spread very easily within a rat population by horizontal rat-to-rat transmission (R(0)much greater than1).

When inoculated into guinea pigs the virus produces an experimental infection characterized primarily by nutritive disturbances, cachexia, and lymphatic reactions, but no local reactions appear at the point of inoculation. This filterable virus can be transmitted from animal to animal, and it passes through the placenta from mother to child. It does not grow on Petroff's medium. When the filterable forms are transformed into acid-fast bacilli, typical tubercular lesions result. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Natale Colosi																					BCI:BCI19300400004914

The spread of HSV to the brain stem and the ventricular ependyma was investigated. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect HSV-DNA in the CSF during the course of infection. The ependyma of the third and fourth ventricle and the central canal contained viral antigen at a late stage of infection in up to 60 % of mice. At this stage we found that many animals gave a positive PCR in the CSF although no antigen could be detected in the ependymal cells. The presence or absence of antigen containing cells could not be related to detection of HSV-DNA in the CSF. The results show that infection of the ventricular wall is not important for the spread of HSV to the CSF.																					WOS:A1991HB17200007	1688078

(1989) on the role of a substrate of Rhipicephalis appendiculatus glands as a strong enhancer of orthomyxovirus Togoto transmission during subcutaneous administration of a moderate virus dose to virus-resistant guinea pig. A tendency was only noticed towards better infectivity of ticks with the administration of sub- or supraoptimal virus doses together with the adjuvant (salivary gland substrate), as well as enhanced sensitivity of male individuals to a combination of virus with adjuvant. The latter fact can be explained by a transptial way of infection typical for male individuals, which was noted earlier during joint nutrition with infected female individuals. A lower level of virus reproducibility in ticks who got it together with the adjuvant, as compared to the control, has been established. Low titer in female individuals after nutrition reduces the likelihood of transovarial transmission of virus with adjuvant.																					BCI:BCI199192065011	2067469

In this model, hepatocytic apoptosis is the main pathological component of liver injuries that are responsible for severe hemorrhagic manifestations. To further elucidate whether viral replication in hepatocytes directly causes apoptosis, we studied the morphological and biochemical changes of apoptosis in HepG2 cells at different time points after PTV infection. Cellular viability began to decrease 12 hours after infection compared with controls. Caspases 3/7 were activated significantly at 48 and 72 hours after infection, and phosphatidylserine translocation and DNA fragmentation were also detected at 48 and 72 hours. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed that infected HepG2 cells were arrested at G(0)/G(1), phase. Furthermore, virus titer increased with apoptosis progression, suggesting that viral replication is necessary for the apoptotic process. These results indicate that PTV infection alone, without a secondary inflammatory cellular reaction, induces hepatocytic apoptosis and suggest that future therapeutics for RVFV hemorrhagic disease might target inhibition of cellular apoptotic pathways during the acute infection.

We and others previously demonstrated that a major mechanism for neutralizing SARS-CoV was through blocking the interaction between the S glycoprotein and the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In this study, we used in vivo electroporation DNA immunization and a pseudovirus-based assay to functionally evaluate immunogenicity and viral entry. We characterized the neutralization and viral entry determinants within the ACE2-binding domain of the S glycoprotein. The deletion of a positively charged region S Delta(422-463) abolished the capacity of the S glycoprotein to induce NAbs in mice vaccinated by in vivo DNA electroporation. Moreover, the S Delta(422-463) pseudovirus was unable to infect HEK293T-ACE2 cells. To determine the specific residues that contribute to related phenotypes, we replaced eight basic amino acids with alanine. We found that a single amino acid substitution (R441A) in the full-length S DNA vaccine failed to induce NAbs and abolished viral entry when pseudoviruses were generated. However, another substitution (R453A) abolished viral entry while retaining the capacity for inducing NAbs. The difference between R441A and R453A suggests that the determinants for immunogenicity and viral entry may not be identical. Our findings provide direct evidence that these basic residues are essential for immunogenicity of the major neutralizing domain and for viral entry. Our data have implications for the rational design of vaccine and antiviral agents as well as for understanding viral tropism.																					WOS:000231633900010	16140741	
J	LUCCHIARI, MA; PEREIRA, CA; KUHN, L; LEFKOVITS, I								THE PATTERN OF PROTEINS SYNTHESIZED IN THE LIVER IS PROFOUNDLY MODIFIED UPON INFECTION OF SUSCEPTIBLE MICE WITH MOUSE HEPATITIS VIRUS-3								RESEARCH IN VIROLOGY				143	4			231	240		10.1016/S0923-2516(06)80111-1				JUL-AUG 1992	1992	Susceptible BALB/c mice, after experimental infection with mouse hepatitis virus 3 (MHV3), revealed virus titres in the liver that increased gradually to a peak of 8 x 10(5) PFU/g of tissue after 3 days' infection, when the mice died of acute hepatitis. BALB/c mice were infected with MHV3, subsequently labelled in vivo with S-35-methionine, and then the liver preparations from both infected and non-infected animals were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Comparisons of the patterns by computer image analysis revealed 17 gene products which increased, and 8 gene products which decreased, upon virus infection in their two-dimensional gel spot intensity. We conclude that during MHV3 infection of a susceptible strain of mice, a major modification in protein synthesis occurs. The pattern alterations were not related to the virus gene products but were mostly endogenous mouse proteins. Whether these proteins are a result of a defence attempt by the animal, or are dictated by the virus in order to prevent a protective response from happening, remains to be shown.

Experimental infection with Sendai virus in mice								ARCH GESAMTE VIRUSFORSCH				22	(3/4)			388	397						1968	1968	Less than one plaque-forming unit (PFU) of Sendai virus was required to produce a serologically demonstrable infection when inoculated intranasally into mice of a specific pathogen-free colony showing no evidence of previous infection. No difference in susceptibility to serologically demonstrable infection and fatal disease was observed between male and female mice or between 4-week-old and 12-week-old mice. The distribution of virus and the antibody response were studied in 4-week-old and 12-week-old mice inoculated with 50 PFU of Sendai virus. Virus was recovered from the lungs and nasal washings from 24 hr. after inoculation to at least 10 days later. Virus titers reached maximum levels at 4 to 6 days. No virus was recovered from the blood, intestines, kidneys and urine. Complement-fixing (CF), hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) and neutralizing antibodies were demonstrable from the 8th day. Neutralizing antibody persisted at a higher level than did CF and HI antibodies. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19684900079469

Mice were experimentally infected with HSV-1 intracranially and treated intraperitoneally with three different doses of EPS extract (6 g/Kg, 8 g/Kg, and 10 g/Kg) for 7 days. One group of 15 mice was infected with HSV-1 but did not receive any treatment, while another group of 15 mice was mock-infected to remain a control group. Animals were observed twice a day for 14 days after virus infection, searching for clinical signs of weight loss, piloerection, isolation, or retardation movement. Compared with the mock-infected group, mortality was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the virus-infected group and the groups that received 6 g/Kg and 8 g/Kg EPS extract. Interestingly, no significant differences in mortality were found between the 10 g/Kg EPS extract and the mock-infected group. Mortality in the 10 g/Kg EPS extract group was substantially improved compared with virus-infected(p < 0.05). Additionally, EPS extracts inhibited HSV-1 replication in the mice brain in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the extracts decreased NF-kappa B protein and mRNA expression and the production of TNF-alpha in HSV-1-infected mice brain tissue. These effects were also dose dependent. Our findings suggest that the EPS extract may be a potential candidate for developing an antiviral drug against HSV-1.																					WOS:000702880600010	34329630

This study examined changes in the expression of cardiac genes resulting from Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection of mice. Methods: Mice (five per group) were experimentally infected with CVB3 or mock-infected with diluent. Altered expression of genes was initially identified by cDNA array, and confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry. Results: Forty-two up-regulated or down-regulated genes were observed in cDNA arrays carrying 588 known mouse genes. Among these, one downregulated gene, Bag-1, known to be involved in inhibition of apoptosis and modulation of chaperone activity, was investigated further. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that Bag-1 expression was down-regulated by up to 30% in virus-infected mouse heart on day 7 compared to the mock-infected. Cell fractionation and western blot analysis confirmed that Bag-1 isoform p32 was predominant in the cytoplasm of mouse myocardium and down-regulated at 4 days or 7 days after CVB3 infection. In contrast, Bag-1 isoform p50 appeared to increase in the nuclear fraction of mouse heart at 7 days after infection. Down regulated expression and distribution of Bag-1 protein or evidence of apoptosis in the infected mouse heart was demonstrated by immunostaining or histochemistry (TUNEL assay), respectively. Conclusion: CVB3 infection induced differential expression of Bag-1 in cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of mouse heart and apoptosis. This may be important in the pathogenesis of enterovirus heart muscle disease. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000168031500007	11282077	
J	Rahman, C. K. F.; Khan Sharun; Ruchi Tiwari; Bilal, M.; Kuldeep Dhama								Can unconventional meat or bushmeat act as a source for SARS-CoV-2.								Journal of Experimental Biology and Agricultural Sciences				8	6			709	720		10.18006/2020.8(6).709.720				2020	2020	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), first reported in people exposed to a local seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China has already affected more than 76 million people around the globe resulting in the death of nearly 1.7 million people as of December 21, 2020. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can potentially infect other animal species owing to the superior host adaptability. Sporadic cases of natural SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in dogs, cats, lion, puma, and tiger while experimental inoculation in several other susceptible animal species resulted in infection. Although, bats are considered the reservoir host for SARS-CoV-2, pangolins, a wild mammal of order Pholidota, is suspected to be the missing link that contributed to transmitting the virus to human beings due to its wide consumption in the Chinese culinary practice. Unconventional meat is consumed in a large quantity all around the world since it acts as a 'low cost' or 'costless' nutritional source in underdeveloped countries. However, in certain communities, geographies, and niches of the globe, meat from wild and other free-ranging mammals, rodents, and reptiles are used as delicacies. The overexploitation of these 'unconventional meat animals' for various reasons threatened biodiversity and contributed to the emergence of novel diseases having significant public health implications. With the swift emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have recognized the important role played by wildlife and their ecosystem in the emergence of novel infections. The interface between human and wild animals is considered the hotspot that facilitate cross-species jumping and disease spillover. Establishing an efficient surveillance system at a potential human-animal interface can limit the spread of novel zoonotic diseases such as COVID-19.																					CABI:20219988033		
J	SOLOV'EV, V. D.								On the Reservoir of the Virus of Spring-Summer Encephalitis in Natural Conditions.				O rezervyare virusa vesenne-letnevo entsefalita v prirode.				Trud. voenn. med. Akad. krasn. Armi.				25				95	111						1941	1941	III. Observations on spring-summer encephalitis were made during the same expedition [see II] in South Ussuriisk taiga in two areas situated along the river Suputinka and separated from each other by 30 kilometres. One of the places, Saputin Reservation, was known to be an endemic area, the other, Krivoi Klutch, to be an area free from infection. Whereas 24 virus strains were isolated from 2, 497 Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in the endemic area, not one of 1, 800 ticks from Krivoi Klutch were found infected. Comparative studies were also made of blood sera of normal human beings, horses, and cattle in both areas; results showed that the sera of inhabitants of the endemic area were highly viricidal. S. considers that this fact is due to hyperimmunization or latent infection caused by repeated bites of infected ticks. He also suggests that the appearance of specific viricidal antibodies in the sera of the population may be of some value in epidemiological prognosis.Out of 399 wild animals examined in the endemic area, a neurotropic virus was isolated four times (hedgehog, red-grey field vole, and mole), three of the strains being S.S. E. virus. No virus could be isolated from 299 wild animals trapped in Krivoi Klutch. The blood sera of all wild animals trapped in the endemic area showed a high content of viricidal bodies. Experimental S.S. E. could be produced in hedgehogs and wolf cubs from areas free of infection, whereas hedgehogs and rodents from the endemic area were resistant to artificial infection, but preserved the virus in the brain for 15 days after intracerebral inoculation. In S's opinion it is highly probable that spontaneous cases or even epizootics of S.S. E. occur among certain species of wild animals. Whether these animals act as reservoirs of infection is not yet known. S. emphasizes the important role played by wild animals in the epidemiology of S. S.E. which, in his opinion, is much more important than in Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The epidemioiogical facts suggest that S. S.E. should be primarily regarded as a disease of wild animals, the path of virus dissemination being tick-animal-tick; this agrees with PAVLOVSKII'S conception of the presence of natural foci of S. S. E.-A. MOLDAWSKY.																					CABI:19442201510

IMVAMUNE(R) and ACAM2000(R) Provide Different Protection against Disease When Administered Postexposure in an Intranasal Monkeypox Challenge Prairie Dog Model								VACCINES				8	3					396	10.3390/vaccines8030396				SEP 2020	2020	The protection provided by smallpox vaccines when used after exposure to Orthopoxviruses is poorly understood. Postexposu re administration of 1st generation smallpox vaccines was effective during eradication. However, historical epidemiological reports and animal studies on postexposure vaccination are difficult to extrapolate to today's populations, and 2nd and 3rd generation vaccines, developed after eradication, have not been widely tested in postexposure vaccination scenarios. In addition to concerns about preparedness for a potential malevolent reintroduction of variola virus, humans are becoming increasingly exposed to naturally occurring zoonotic orthopoxviruses and, following these exposures, disease severity is worse in individuals who never received smallpox vaccination. This study investigated whether postexposure vaccination of prairie dogs with 2nd and 3rd generation smallpox vaccines was protective against monkeypox disease in four exposure scenarios. We infected animals with monkeypox virus at doses of 10(4)pfu (2x LD50) or 10(6)pfu (170x LD50) and vaccinated the animals with IMVAMUNE(R)or ACAM2000(R)either 1 or 3 days after challenge. Our results indicated that postexposure vaccination protected the animals to some degree from the 2x LD50, but not the 170x LD(5)challenge. In the 2x LD(50)challenge, we also observed that administration of vaccine at 1 day was more effective than administration at 3 days postexposure for IMVAMUNE(R), but ACAM2000(R)was similarly effective at either postexposure vaccination time-point. The effects of postexposure vaccination and correlations with survival of total and neutralizing antibody responses, protein targets, take formation, weight loss, rash burden, and viral DNA are also presented.

When we infected day 6 chickens with H4N6 low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV), we observed that H4N6 LPAIV infection increased the staining intensity of KUL01 + cells in trachea, lungs and duodenum of chickens at 3 days post-infection. Then, we used clodronate liposomes intra-abdominally in 5 day-old chickens and found significant reduction of staining intensity of KUL01 + cells in trachea and duodenum but not in lungs at 4 days post-treatment. When we infected the clo-dronate liposome and PBS liposome treated chickens with H4N6 LPAIV intra-nasally at day 6, we found no effect on H4N6 LPAIV genome loads in trachea, lungs and duodenum of chickens. This study indicates that although KUL01 + cell intensity are increased in respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues in chickens following H4N6 LPAIV infection, the decrease of KUL01 + cell intensity using clodronate liposomes did not change the H4N6 LPAIV genome loads in any of the examined tissues suggesting that KUL01 + cells may not be critical during H4N6 LPAIV infection in chicken.

The M2 Gene Is a Determinant of Reovirus-Induced Myocarditis								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				96	2					e01879-21					JAN 2022	2022	Although a broad range of viruses cause myocarditis, the mechanisms that underlie viral myocarditis are poorly understood. Here, we report that the M2 gene is a determinant of reovirus myocarditis. The M2 gene encodes outer capsid protein mu 1, which mediates host membrane penetration during reovirus entry. We infected newborn C57BL/6 mice with reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) or a reassortant reovirus in which the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) was substituted into the T1L genetic background (T1L/T3DM2). T1L was nonlethal in wild-type mice, whereas more than 90% of mice succumbed to T1L/T3DM2 infection. T1L/T3DM2 produced higher viral loads than T1L at the site of inoculation. In secondary organs, T1L/T3DM2 was detected with more rapid kinetics and reached higher peak titers than T1L. We found that hearts from T1L/T3DM2-infected mice were grossly abnormal, with large lesions indicative of substantial inflammatory infiltrate. Lesions in T1L/T3DM2-infected mice contained necrotic cardiomyocytes with pyknotic debris, as well as extensive lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration. In contrast, T1L induced the formation of small purulent lesions in a small subset of animals, consistent with T1L being mildly myocarditic. Finally, more activated caspase-3-positive cells were observed in hearts from animals infected with T1L/T3DM2 than T1L. Together, our findings indicate that substitution of the T3D M2 allele into an otherwise T1L genetic background is sufficient to change a nonlethal infection into a lethal infection. Our results further indicate that T3D M2 enhances T1L replication and dissemination in vivo, which potentiates the capacity of reovirus to cause myocarditis.IMPORTANCE Reovirus is a nonenveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome that serves as a model for studying viral myocarditis. The mechanisms by which reovirus drives myocarditis development are not fully elucidated. We found that substituting the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) into an otherwise type 1 Lang (T1L) genetic background (T1L/T3DM2) was sufficient to convert the nonlethal T1L strain into a lethal infection in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. T1L/T3DM2 disseminated more efficiently and reached higher maximum titers than T1L in all organs tested, including the heart. T1L is mildly myocarditic and induced small areas of cardiac inflammation in a subset of mice. In contrast, hearts from mice infected with T1L/T3DM2 contained extensive cardiac inflammatory infiltration and more activated caspase-3-positive cells, which is indicative of apoptosis. Together, our findings identify the reovirus M2 gene as a new determinant of reovirus-induced myocarditis.																					WOS:000766836300004

The virus (strain M-1) replicated in laboratory-bred Aedes aegyptiand Culex quinquefasciatus,and was transmitted by laboratory-bred A. albopictusto healthy newborn albino mice. Skeletal muscles of newborn albino mice experimentally infected with the virus showed degeneration, atrophy, necrosis and inflammatory changes of muscle fibres. Antibody prevalence in humans and animals ranged from 10.3% by neutralization tests of samples from healthy people in 1979 to 26.4% by CF tests of samples from people with febrile illnesses in 1982. The high prevalence of antibody in pigs, horses and goats (17.6%-37.5%) indicated that infection with Getah or a closely related virus is relatively common in domestic animals.

Rabbits could be infected by scarification but not by s/c or i/v routes. Guineapigs and mice proved refractory. Cross immunity tests revealed that the new field virus was identical with the I.V.R.I, strain of CPD virus but not with sheep and goat pox virus. The latter, however, conferred some decree of immunity against CPD. Rabbit-adapted virus produced only a slight reaction in goats and did not immunize. Formolized field virus, however, afforded protection. The immunity in artificially infected animals was absolute when tested 8 months after recovery. While handling the experimental animals two workers contracted infection with lesions on the hands and neck.-H. M. BHATIA.																					CABI:19622201882

The study was based on natural infection in the dog, cat and jackal; in the other species street virus infection was achieved by s/c or i/m inoculation of virulent saliva and fixed virus infection by intracerebral or sub-occipital inoculation (in large animals) of a suspension of cerebral cortex. In all species inflammatory phenomena were more intense and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system was less with fixed than with street virus. With street virus, the number of Negri bodies was in inverse ratio to the degree of inflammation. It is considered that route of inoculation, virulence of the virus, time of year, age and species of the animals play a role in the inflammatory process in nerve tissue. The relationship between lesions and symptoms is discussed. Other aspects studied were: route followed by the virus in the body, difference in behaviour between fixed and street virus, and the problem of latent rabies.-T.E.G.R.

The rabies virus (pasteur PV strain) was propagated in VERO cells attached to microcarriers in a 3.7-l bioreactor. Virus titers of about 10(6) LD(50)/ml were obtained regularly. 2. Ultrafiltration was efficient for concentrating the virus suspensions, and the sucrose gradient reduced the residual VERO cell DNA to acceptable levels (less than 50 pg/dose). The remaining cell DNA content was evaluated by dot-blot hybridization with a probe prepared with VERO cell DNA. 3.

We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation.																					WOS:000503162900013	31784108

The outbreak began with increased mortality in a single room; subsequently, small numbers of animals in separate cages in other rooms were involved. Signs of disease were often mild, and overall mortality was low; BALB/cByJ mice were more severely affected, and many of them died spontaneously. Conjunctivitis was the most common clinical sign of disease in addition to occasional small, crusty scabs on sparsely haired or hairless areas of skin. Necropsy findings included conjunctivitis, enlarged spleen, and pale liver. Hemorrhage into the pyloric region of the stomach and proximal portion of the small. intestine was observed in experimentally infected animals. In immune competent and immune deficient mice, the most common histologic finding was multifocal to coalescing splenic necrosis; necrosis was seen less frequently in liver, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. Necrosis was rarely observed in ovary, vagina, uterus, colon, or lung. Splenic necrosis often involved over 50% of the examined tissue, including white and red pulp. Hepatic necrosis was evident as either large, well-demarcated areas of coagulative necrosis or as multiple, random, interlacing bands of necrosis. Intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies were seen in conjunctival mucosae and haired palpebra. Ectromelia virus was confirmed as the causative agent of the epizootic by electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, animal inoculations, serologic testing, virus isolation, and polymerase chain reaction. Serologic testing was of little value in the initial stages of the outbreak, although 6 weeks later, orthopoxvirus-specific antibody was detected in colony mice by indirect fluorescent antibody and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedures. The outbreak originated from injection of mice with a contaminated, commercially produced, pooled mouse serum. The most relevant concern may be the unknown location of the source of the virus and the presence of a reservoir for this virus within the United States.

An insertional mutagenesis screen identifies genes that cooperate with Mll-AF9 in a murine leukemogenesis model								BLOOD				119	19			4512	4523		10.1182/blood-2010-04-281428				MAY 10 2012	2012	Patients with a t(9;11) translocation (MLL-AF9) develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and while in mice the expression of this fusion oncogene also results in the development of myeloid leukemia, it is with long latency. To identify mutations that cooperate with Mll-AF9, we infected neonatal wild-type (WT) or Mll-AF9 mice with a murine leukemia virus (MuLV). MuLV-infected Mll-AF9 mice succumbed to disease significantly faster than controls presenting predominantly with myeloid leukemia while infected WT animals developed predominantly lymphoid leukemia. We identified 88 candidate cancer genes near common sites of proviral insertion. Analysis of transcript levels revealed significantly elevated expression of Mn1, and a trend toward increased expression of Bcl11a and Fosb in Mll-AF9 murine leukemia samples with proviral insertions proximal to these genes. Accordingly, FOSB and BCL11A were also overexpressed in human AML harboring MLL gene translocations. FOSB was revealed to be essential for growth in mouse and human myeloid leukemia cells using shRNA lentiviral vectors in vitro. Importantly, MN1 cooperated with Mll-AF9 in leukemogenesis in an in vivo BM viral transduction and transplantation assay. Together, our data identified genes that define transcription factor networks and important genetic pathways acting during progression of leukemia induced by MLL fusion oncogenes.

First, to determine the existence of tick-borne phleboviruses (TBPVs), genetic surveillance of phleboviruses in ticks was conducted mainly in Hokkaido, the northernmost island in Japan from 2013 to 2015. Genes of two TBPVs, previously reported as Mukawa virus (MKWV) and a newly identified relative of MKWV, Kuriyama virus (KURV), were detected and the viruses were isolated from Ixodes persulcatus collected in Hokkaido, but not in L persulcatus collected from other areas of Japan. These viruses were phylogenetically and antigenically similar to each other. Next, to investigate the infection of MKWV in mammals, serum samples from wildlife captured in Hokkaido from 2007 to 2011 were used for serological screening. Neutralizing antibodies against MKWV were detected in both Yezo-deer (Cervus nippon yesoensis) (2/50) and raccoons (Procyon lotor) (16/64). However, no infectious MKWV was recovered from laboratory mice in experimental infections, though viral RNAs were detected in their tissues. Thus, MKWV and KURV may maintain tick-mammalian life cycles in Hokkaido, suggesting their potential as causative agents of tick-borne diseases in mammals.

Methods: Five-week-old A/J inbred male mice were divided into 5 groups. Four of those groups were inoculated intraperitoneally with 5 X 10(4) (group 1), 1 X 10(5) (group 2), 5 X 10(5) (group 3), or 1 X 10(6) (group 4) PFU of CVB3. Control mice were inoculated with uninfected Vero cell lysate in DMEM. Mice from each group were sacrificed on days 7 or 14 after inoculation. Results: Bloody diarrhea, earlier weight loss, perianal swelling, and death were correlated with higher viral load. One of ten mice in group 3 and 5 of 10 mice in group 4 died spontaneously between days 4 and 12 after inoculation. All of the remaining 34 mice of infected groups demonstrated extensive pancreatic infl ammation. Focal myocarditis developed in only 4 (11.8%) of those 34 subjects. Amylase and creatine kinase activities in the serum were increased in the mice of infected groups. CVB3 RNA was detected in the heart and pancreatic tissue in all subjects. The CVB3 RNA copy number in pancreatic tissue was not correlated with the severity of inflammation. Conclusions: In the murine model, viral loading dose determines the clinical features of CVB3-induced infection, and the severity of pancreatitis is not correlated with the viral loading dose or tissue level of viral RNA.

The disease tends to-recur on the same farms and to spread to neighbouring-districts. The incidence was most common amongst pigs, and considerable losses were observed among young animals. In adult pigs the disease took a benign course, often without symptoms. The serum of such animals showed viricidal properties and neutralized the virus in vitro. The disease was also observed in dogs, cats, cattle, and horses which had been in close contact with pigs. In cattle, the course was severe and fatal. The incidence was more common during the autumn and winter months, probably due to overcrowding and exposure and to contact with rodents. On one farm, the virus was isolated from dead mice. It is supposed that affected pigs and cattle spread the virus through the-nasal discharge.Artificial infection with brain emulsion from an infected rabbit was carried out in seven pigs of 3-4-months old; infection by ingestion or subcutaneous inoculation set up a mild form of the disease, whereas intranasal instillation with previous scarification of the mucous membrane provoked a severe form. Rabbits.were infected by subcutaneous inoculation with nasal discharge and urine of an experimentally infected piglet.Suggested control measures include the recommendation that Aujeszky's disease be included in the list of notifiable diseases.-A.

However, certain previously unknown patterns have been observed: (1) prolongation of the febrile period by two days; (2) extended period was characterized by stability of serum biochemical parameters; (3) marked vacuolization of the neutrophil cytoplasm; (4) appearance of juvenile lymphocytes on day 3 and by the end of the disease; and (5) a considerable increase in the spontaneous mononuclear proliferation (along with a decrease in the mitogen-induced proliferation) during the terminal stage of infection. The severity of pathological coagulation was found to correlate with the activity of serum cytokines - IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha: their activities increased about 250- and 100-fold, respectively.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 5-Dependent Immune Responses in the Draining Lymph Node Protect against West Nile Virus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				88	19			11007	11021		10.1128/JVI.01545-14				OCT 2014	2014	Upon activation of Toll-like and RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathways, the transcription factor IRF5 translocates to the nucleus and induces antiviral immune programs. The recent discovery of a homozygous mutation in the immunoregulatory gene guanine exchange factor dedicator of cytokinesis 2 (Dock2(mu/mu)) in several Irf5(-/-) mouse colonies has complicated interpretation of immune functions previously ascribed to IRF5. To define the antiviral functions of IRF5 in vivo, we infected backcrossed Irf5(-/-) x Dock2(wt/wt) mice (here called Irf5(-/-) mice) and independently generated CMV-Cre Irf5(fl/fl) mice with West Nile virus (WNV), a pathogenic neurotropic flavivirus. Compared to congenic wild-type animals, Irf5(-/-) and CMV-Cre Irf5(fl/fl) mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection, and this phenotype was associated with increased infection in peripheral organs, which resulted in higher virus titers in the central nervous system. The loss of IRF5, however, was associated with only small differences in the type I interferon response systemically and in the draining lymph node during WNV infection. Instead, lower levels of several other proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as fewer and less activated immune cells, were detected in the draining lymph node 2 days after WNV infection. WNV-specific antibody responses in Irf5(-/-) mice also were blunted in the context of live or inactivated virus infection and this was associated with fewer antigen-specific memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells. Our results with Irf5(-/-) mice establish a key role for IRF5 in shaping the early innate immune response in the draining lymph node, which impacts the spread of virus infection, optimal B cell immunity, and disease pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEAlthough the roles of IRF3 and IRF7 in orchestrating innate and adaptive immunity after viral infection are established, the function of the related transcription factor IRF5 remains less certain. Prior studies in Irf5(-/-) mice reported conflicting results as to the contribution of IRF5 in regulating type I interferon and adaptive immune responses. The lack of clarity may stem from a recently discovered homozygous loss-of-function mutation of the immunoregulatory gene Dock2 in several colonies of Irf5(-/-) mice. Here, using a mouse model with a deficiency in IRF5 and wild-type Dock2 alleles, we investigated how IRF5 modulates West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis and host immune responses. Our in vivo studies indicate that IRF5 has a key role in shaping the early proinflammatory cytokine response in the draining lymph node, which impacts immunity and control of WNV infection.

In the present study the effect of DHEA on protection from stress-induced infection was examined. Mice were exposed to cold stress, isolation stress or dexamethasone injections and inoculated with the attenuated non-invasive WN-25 encephalitis virus. DHEA treatment prevented the induction of encephalitis and decreased mortality rate from 67 per cent, 75 per cent and 67 per cent to 22 per cent, 32 per cent and 11 per cent, respectively. Postponement of the onset of disease, reduced virus levels in the brain on day 7, increased mean time of death, and prevention of spleen and thymus involution was also observed. The protective effect is mediated probably by counteraction of stress-induced immunosuppression that appears during viral infections. We suggest that DHEA may act as an 'antistress' agent, an agent that is effective in protection against viral infection by blocking stress-induced immunosuppression.					3RD CONF OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOC FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF STRESS3RD CONF OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOC FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF STRESS	JUN 07-08, 1990JUN 07-08, 1990	INT SOC INVESTIGAT STRESSINT SOC INVESTIGAT STRESS	PADOVA, ITALYPADOVA, ITALY													WOS:A1992JG04300008

C.; Souza, Daniele G.; Teixeira, Mauro Martins; Marques, Rafael Elias								Type I interferons are essential while type II interferon is dispensable for protection against St. Louis encephalitis virus infection in the mouse brain								VIRULENCE				12	1			244	259		10.1080/21505594.2020.1869392				JAN 1 2021	2021	St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) is a neglected mosquito-borne flavivirus that causes severe neurological disease in humans. SLEV replication in the central nervous system (CNS) induces the local production of interferons (IFNs), which are attributed to host protection. The antiviral response to SLEV infection in the CNS is not completely understood, which led us to characterize the roles of IFNs using mouse models of St. Louis encephalitis. We infected mice deficient in type I IFN receptor (ABR(-/-)) or deficient in Type II IFN (IFN gamma(-/-)) and assessed the contribution of each pathway to disease development. We found that type I and II IFNs play different roles in SLEV infection. Deficiency in type I IFN signaling was associated to an early and increased mortality, uncontrolled SLEV replication and impaired ISG expression, leading to increased proinflammatory cytokine production and brain pathology. Conversely, IFN gamma(-/-) mice were moderately resistant to SLEV infection. IFN gamma deficiency caused no changes to viral load or SLEV-induced encephalitis and did not change the expression of ISGs in the brain. We found that type I IFN is essential for the control of SLEV replication whereas type II IFN was not associated with protection in this model.																					WOS:000605731700001	33410731

Chinese Journal of Zoonoses				21	11			931	935						2005	2005	Guineapigs were immunized intramuscularly with either or both the non-replicating, recombinant vaccines, i.e., fowl pox virus UTA2-OAT and the DNA plasmid pVR1-OAT, both expressing the chimeric foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) multiple-epitope gene. Anti-FMDV antibody and lymphocyte responses were analysed. The immunized animals were also experimentally infected with FMDV to assess the prophylactic efficacy of the vaccines. Significant humoral- and lymphocyte-mediated immune responses were observed among vaccinated animals, especially among those who received both recombinant vaccines. Complete protection against experimental FMDV infection was observed in 25% (1/4) of the animals, while partial protection was observed in 50% (2/4). All control animals (n=4) not receiving any vaccine and experimentally infected with FMDV died. It is concluded that the studied recombinant vaccines are highly immunogenic, and are potential candidate vaccines against FMDV.																					CABI:20053221207

Multigenic control of resistance to Sendai virus infection in mice								INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION				9	6	SI		1253	1259		10.1016/j.meegid.2009.08.011				DEC 2009	2009	Experimental infection of mice with Sendai virus (SeV) is frequently used as a model of viral pathogenesis of human respiratory disease. To understand the differences in host response to SeV among mice strains, we carried out genetic mapping studies in DBA/2 (D2) (susceptible) and C57BL/6 (B6) (resistant) mice. F-1, F-2, and N-2 backcrossed mice were generated and examined for their disease resistance and susceptibility. For the determination of virulence, percentage body weight loss and survival time were used as phenotypes. We, then, carried out a genome wide scan on 108 backcrossed mice for linkage with percentage body weight loss as phenotype. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) showing significant linkage was mapped to the distal portion of Chr4 (SeV1). In addition, two other QTLs showing suggestive statistical linkage were also detected on Chr 8 and 14. We, further, performed genome scan for interactions with least squares analysis of variance of all pairs of informative makers in backcrossed progenies. We identified a highly significant epistatic interaction between D3Mit182 and D14Mit10, then denoted as SeV2 and SeV3, respectively, and the latter was the same locus showing a suggestive level on Chr 14 in QTL analysis. Considered genotypes of these three loci, we could account for more than 90% of genetic effect on the differential response to SeV infection between B6 and D2 mice. These findings revealed a novel gene interactions controlling SeV resistance in mice and will enable the identification of resistance genes encoded within these loci. (C) 2009 Elsevier B,V.

The effects which reduced the organism's [mice] reactivity (cooling, irradiation) inhibited production of interferon. The period of mass death of experimentally infected animals coincided with complete or almost complete inhibition of the interferon-producing capacity of leukocytes. This index was observed not only in viral diseases but also in other internal diseases not associated with viruses etiologically. Dynamic study of the interferon reaction of leukocytes showed that in most cases, the interferon titers increased with improvement of the patient's state while impairment of the latter resulted in reduction of the interferon titers. Leukocytic interferon titers were relatively low in infants. They gradually increased in children over 1 yr, attaining their maximum in adults. After age 60 yr interferon production dropped drastically. The index of leukocyte interferon production should be used not only for evaluation of specific immunoreactivity (to viruses), but also for determination of nonspecific reactivity.

In contrast, s51 caused fewer clinical signs and no mortality. Nevertheless, comparison of the virus derived from the mutant (ps51) and wild-type (ps55) S.A.AR86 molecular clones demonstrated that s51 grew as well as or better than the wild-type s55 virus in tissue culture and that viral titers in the brain following i.c. infection with s51 were equivalent to those of wild-type s55 virus, Analysis of viral replication within the brain by in situ hybridization revealed that both viruses established infection in similar regions of the brain at early times postinfection (12 to 72 h). However, at late times postinfection, the wild-type s55 virus had spread throughout large areas of the brain, while the s51 mutant exhibited a restricted pattern of replication. This suggests that s51 is either defective in spreading throughout the brain at late times postinfection or is cleared more rapidly than s55, Further evidence for the contribution of nsP1 Thr 538 to S.A.AR86 neurovirulence was provided by experiments in which a threonine residue was introduced at nsP1 position 538 of Sindbis virus strain TR339, which is nonneurovirulent in weanling mice, The resulting virus, 39ns1, demonstrated significantly increased neurovirulence and morbidity, including weight loss and hind limb paresis. These results demonstrate a role for alphavirus nonstructural protein genes in adult mouse neurovirulence.																					WOS:000086365000030	10756033

Pathogenetical characterization of MHV-76: a spontaneous 9.5-kilobase-deletion mutant of murine lymphotropic gammaherpesvirus 68								ACTA VETERINARIA BRNO				77	2			231	237		10.2754/avb200877020231				JUN 2008	2008	Murid gammaherpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) provides a small animal model for the study of animal gammaherpesviruses. MHV-76 is a spontaneous deletion mutant as compared to the prototype strain of MuHV-4 (MHV-68). The MHV-76 genome lacks at least 12 ORFs at the 5'-end including the M1, M2, M3 and M4 genes and the eight viral t-RNA-like genes. During 27 months of experimental infection of BALB/c mice we followed their pathogenesis, immunology and oncogenic properties. After intranasal infection with MHV-76, the infectious virus was detected in the blood, thymus, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, bone marrow, peritoneal macrophages, lymph nodes, kidneys, mammary glands, brain and small intestine. The acute phase of infection was attenuated, but the chronic phase of infection was accompanied with long persistence of virus not only in the lymphatic, but in the neural and glandular tissue, as well. In comparison with the prototype strain, splenomegaly and lymphocytosis was very low. Surprisingly, during 27 months the BALB/c mice infected with MHV-76 did not develop lymphoproliferative disorders like infectious mononucleosis, leukaemia or lymphomas. We hypothesize that the M4 gene, present in all oncogenic MHV isolates, might be related (directly or indirectly) to their transforming properties.																					WOS:000257226400011

During the acute paralytic period of the infection, the virus besides being found in the central nervous system is characterized by the development of inflammatory foci in the brain membranes, around the vessels and nervous tissue. In the neurons of the horn of ammon (hippocampus major) and hippocampus, phenomena of degeneration are found.

In Vivo Suppression of HIV by Antigen Specific T Cells Derived from Engineered Hematopoietic Stem Cells								PLOS PATHOGENS				8	4					e1002649	10.1371/journal.ppat.1002649				APR 2012	2012	The HIV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response is a critical component in controlling viral replication in vivo, but ultimately fails in its ability to eradicate the virus. Our intent in these studies is to develop ways to enhance and restore the HIV-specific CTL response to allow long-term viral suppression or viral clearance. In our approach, we sought to genetically manipulate human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such that they differentiate into mature CTL that will kill HIV infected cells. To perform this, we molecularly cloned an HIV-specific T cell receptor (TCR) from CD8+ T cells that specifically targets an epitope of the HIV-1 Gag protein. This TCR was then used to genetically transduce HSCs. These HSCs were then introduced into a humanized mouse containing human fetal liver, fetal thymus, and hematopoietic progenitor cells, and were allowed to differentiate into mature human CD8+ CTL. We found human, HIV-specific CTL in multiple tissues in the mouse. Thus, genetic modification of human HSCs with a cloned TCR allows proper differentiation of the cells to occur in vivo, and these cells migrate to multiple anatomic sites, mimicking what is seen in humans. To determine if the presence of the transgenic, HIV-specific TCR has an effect on suppressing HIV replication, we infected with HIV-1 mice expressing the transgenic HIV-specific TCR and, separately, mice expressing a non-specific control TCR. We observed significant suppression of HIV replication in multiple organs in the mice expressing the HIV-specific TCR as compared to control, indicating that the presence of genetically modified HIV-specific CTL can form a functional antiviral response in vivo. These results strongly suggest that stem cell based gene therapy may be a feasible approach in the treatment of chronic viral infections and provide a foundation towards the development of this type of strategy.

In this study, we infected mice with a genetically modified pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) that allowed visualization of virus-specific CTL and infected cells in situ. The first virus-specific T cells entered the lung via blood vessels in the scattered foci of PVM-infected cells, which densely clustered around the bronchi at day 7 after infection. At this time, overall pulmonary virus load was maximal, but the mice showed no overt signs of disease. On days 8 to 9, T cells gained access to the infected bronchial epithelium and to the lung interstitium, which was associated with a reduction in the number of virus-infected cells within the initial clusters but could not prevent further virus spread throughout the lung tissue. Interestingly, recruitment of virus-specific CTL throughout the parenchyma was still ongoing on day 10, when the virus infection was already largely controlled. This also represented the peak of clinical disease. Thus, disease was associated with an exuberant T cell infiltration late in the course of the infection, which may be required to completely eliminate virus at residual foci of infection. PVM-induced immunopathology may thus result from the need to generate widespread T cell infiltrates to complete the elimination of virus-infected cells in a large organ like the lung. This experimental model provides the first insights into the spatiotemporal evolution of pulmonary antiviral T cell immunity in vivo.																					WOS:000325275800030	23946463

Disease severity is species dependent, ranging from mild to moderate for macaques to severe and even lethal for certain New World monkey species. To investigate if squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus), which are reported to develop a course of disease similar to humans, may be better suited than macaques for the identification of virulence determinants or the evaluation of therapeutics, we infected them with a green fluorescent protein-expressing MeV. Compared to cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with the same virus, the squirrel monkeys developed more-severe immunosuppression, higher viral load, and a broader range of clinical signs typical for measles. In contrast, infection with an MeV unable to interact with the epithelial receptor nectin-4, while causing immunosuppression, resulted in only a mild and transient rash and a short-lived elevation of the body temperature. Similar titers of the wild-type and nectin-4-blind MeV were detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph node homogenates, but only the wild-type virus was found in tracheal lavage fluids and urine. Thus, our study demonstrates the importance of MeV interactions with nectin-4 for clinical disease in the new and better-performing S. sciureus model of measles pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE The characterization of mechanisms underlying measles virus clinical disease has been hampered by the lack of an animal model that reproduces the course of disease seen in human patients. Here, we report that infection of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) fulfills these requirements. Comparative infection with wild-type and epithelial cell receptor-blind viruses demonstrated the importance of epithelial cell infection for clinical disease, highlighting the spread to epithelia as an attractive target for therapeutic strategies.

In an experimental infection model using Sendai virus, an intranasal (i.n.) administration of rhM-CSF (20 mu g per mouse) 2 days before infection induced significant protection against a lethal infection of this virus. Also, its antiviral activity was dependent upon the dose of rhM-CSF. However; a subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of rhM-CSF with an effective close (20 mu g per mouse) i.n. did not confer protection. In a time course analysis of virus growth in the lungs, mice given rhM-CSF in. significantly inhibited the early period of infection, compared with the untreated mice. Moreover, the level of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in lung wash fluids from the rhM-CSF-treated mice was higher than that of the untreated mice. These results suggested that the mucosal (i.n.), but not the systemic (s.c.) administration of rhM-CSF augments host resistance against mucosal infection with Sendai virus, and that its prophylactic activity is related to growth inhibition of the virus and enhanced IFN-gamma secretion in the lungs.

Experimental infection of hamsters and the resulting respiratory disease is one of the preferred animal models since clinical signs of disease and virus shedding are similar to more severe cases of human COVID-19. The main route of challenge has been direct inoculation of the virus via the intranasal route. To resemble the natural infection, we designed a bespoke natural transmission cage system to assess whether recipient animals housed in physically separate adjacent cages could become infected from a challenged donor animal in a central cage, with equal airflow across the two side cages. To optimise viral shedding in the donor animals, a low and moderate challenge dose were compared after direct intranasal challenge, but similar viral shedding responses were observed and no discernible difference in kinetics. The results from our natural transmission set-up demonstrate that most recipient hamsters are infected within the system developed, with variation in the kinetics and levels of disease between individual animals. Common clinical outputs used for the assessment in directly-challenged hamsters, such as weight loss, are less obvious in hamsters who become infected from naturally acquiring the infection. The results demonstrate the utility of a natural transmission model for further work on assessing the differences between virus strains and evaluating interventions using a challenge system which more closely resembles human infection.

After 48 hours, spreading of the virus caused histopathologic changes in the lung tissues and bronchi. No other organs were thus affected. Considerable percentage differences were noted with respect to the occurrence of the virus in the various organs: 100% of the time in the lungs; 85% in the liver; 60% in the spleen. The titres were higher in the organs than in the blood. Indirect immuno-fluorescence showed virus accumulations in the endothelia of the lever vessels. Scattered fluorescence in the perivascular tissues of the liver indicated the faculty of the virus to penetrate the walls of the blood vessels. Under the electron microscope, characteristic encapsulations in lungs and liver were observed. These bodies contained particles which corresponded in size and shape to those of the most frequent forms of influenza virus. Their presence in the liver may indicate the ability of the virus to multiply in this organ which throws certain doubts on its strict pneumotropism. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19654600044373

J	Cohen, JI; Cox, E; Pesnicak, L; Srinivas, S; Krogmann, T								The varicella-zoster virus open reading frame 63 latency-associated protein is critical for establishment of latency								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				78	21			11833	11840		10.1128/JVI.78.21.11833-11840.2004				NOV 2004	2004	Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) expresses at least six viral transcripts during latency. One of these transcripts, derived from open reading frame 63 (ORF63), is one of the most abundant viral RNAs expressed during latency. The VZV ORF63 protein has been detected in human and experimentally infected rodent ganglia by several laboratories. We have deleted >90% of both copies of the ORF63 gene from the VZV genome. Animals inoculated with the ORF63 mutant virus had lower mean copy numbers of latent VZV genomes in the dorsal root ganglia 5 to 6 weeks after infection than animals inoculated with parental or rescued virus, and the frequency of latently infected animals was significantly lower in animals infected with the ORF63 mutant virus than in animals inoculated with parental or rescued virus. In contrast, the frequency of animals latently infected with viral mutants in other genes that are equally or more impaired for replication in vitro, compared with the ORF63 mutant, is similar to that of animals latently infected with parental VZV. Examination of dorsal root ganglia 3 days after infection showed high levels of VZV DNA in animals infected with either ORF63 mutant or parental virus; however, by days 6 and 10 after infection, the level of viral DNA in animals infected with the ORF63 mutant was significantly lower than that in animals infected with parental virus. Thus, ORF63 is not required for VZV to enter ganglia but is the first VZV gene shown to be critical for establishment of latency. Since the present vaccine can reactivate and cause shingles, a VZV vaccine based on the ORF63 mutant virus might be safer.																					WOS:000224540900038	15479825

Beutler, B		Innate resistance to flavivirus infections and the functions of 2 '-5 ' oligoadenylate synthetases								IMMUNOLOGY, PHENOTYPE FIRST: HOW MUTATIONS HAVE ESTABLISHED NEW PRINCIPLES AND PATHWAYS IN IMMUNOLOGY		Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology		321				85	100						2008	2008	Mouse susceptibility to experimental infections with flaviviruses is significantly influenced by a cluster of genes on chromosome 5 encoding a family of proteins with enzymatic properties, the 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS). Positional cloning of the locus in question has revealed that susceptibility of laboratory inbred strains to this class of virus is associated with a nonsense mutation in the gene encoding the OAS 1 B isoform. Analysis of the molecular structure of the cluster in different mammalian species including human indicates that the cluster is extremely polymorphic with a highly variable number of genes and pseudogenes whose functions are not yet completely established. Although still preliminary, a few recent observations also substantiate a possible role for OAS I in human susceptibility to viral infections (West Nile virus, SARS, etc.) and its possible involvement in some other diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Finally, convergent observations indicate that the molecules encoded by the 2'-5'OAS cluster might be involved in other fundamental cellular functions such as cell growth and differentiation, gene regulation, and apoptosis.

Screening for expression of apoptosis-related genes has shown alterations in the genes for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the TNF receptor family. This study examined the roles of the TNF receptor-related extrinsic pathway and the Bcl-2 family-associated mitochondrial pathway in PTV-induced cell death. The effects of caspase inhibitors (caspls) and TNF on cellular viability, virus replication, and morphological and biochemical changes in apoptosis were examined in HepG2 cells at different time points after infection with PTV (Adames strain). The results showed that caspls dampened the virus-induced reduction in cellular viability, partially suppressed and delayed viral titres and antigen expression, and partially decreased the expression of apoptotic genes, caspase activities and DNA fragmentation. TNF treatment further decreased cellular viability after PTV infection and increased the level of apoptosis, whilst caspls partially inhibited these effects. These findings indicate that TNF, caspase-8 and caspase-9 contribute to PTV-induced hepatocytic apoptosis and that additional mediators are probably also involved in this process. These mediators from different pathways correlated with one another and may be interlinked.																					WOS:000259285600014	18753227

To study the efficiency of intratumoral (i.t.) spread by ONYX-015, we infected specific fractions of tumor cells (two p53-deficient tumor lines and one p53 functional line) in vitro before subcutaneous inoculation into nude mice. infection of as few as 5% of p53(-) tumor cells prevented tumor development in all cases; infection of 1% of p53(-) tumor cells resulted in significant growth inhibition but did not prevent tumor formation. In contrast, infection with ONYX-015 had no significant effect on p53(+) tumor formation. These data suggested that replication-dependent tumor cell lysis and spread was occurring, bur that tumor destruction might be improved by increasing i.t. virus distribution. Two treatment parameters were then varied to determine whether virus distribution, and consequently efficacy, could be improved. Divided i.t. injections of virus were more efficacious than a single injection of the same total dose. Likewise, increasing the volume of the viral suspension for i.t. injection allowed better distribution within the tumor mass and increased efficacy. These results have implications for the treatment of cancer patients with viral agents.																					WOS:000084164200002	10608346

HIV p24 antigen was detected ten-fifteen days after infection and reached peak values five-six weeks later. Antigenemia subsequently decreased and showed an oscillating course with a progressive decrease which persisted throughout the observation period.Two weeks after infection we detected IgG antibodies to the major core protein p24; reactivity to gp4l was observed as early as reactivity to p24 and persisted throughout observation period.The IgG antibodies to all HIV epitopes peaked two-three weeks after infection; the time course showed a decrease after ten weeks, progressively decreasing thereafter. After sixty-five weeks of infection the IgG seratiter value was lower but remained positive.Viruses indistinguishable from HIV were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected mice 30, 60, 180 days after infection.These seroimmunological and virological data confirm that the immunocompetent mouse may serve as a low-cost reproducible model for HIV-1 in vivo research.

The arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strain Clone 13 provides a benchmark model for studying chronic infection. A major genetic determinant for its ability to persist maps to a single amino acid exchange in the viral L protein, which exhibits RdRp activity, yet its functional consequences remain elusive. To unravel the L protein interactions with the host proteome, we engineered infectious L protein-tagged LCMV virions by reverse genetics. A subsequent mass-spectrometric analysis of L protein pulldowns from infected human cells revealed a comprehensive network of interacting host proteins. The obtained LCMV L protein interactome was bioinformatically integrated with known host protein interactors of RdRps from other RNA viruses, emphasizing interconnected modules of human proteins. Functional characterization of selected interactors highlighted proviral (DDX3X) as well as antiviral (NKRF, TRIM21) host factors. To corroborate these findings, we infected Trim21(-/-) mice with LCMV and found impaired virus control in chronic infection. These results provide insights into the complex interactions of the arenavirus LCMV and other viral RdRps with the host proteome and contribute to a better molecular understanding of how chronic viruses interact with their host.

Host-pathogen dynamics of squirrelpox virus infection in red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris)								VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY				182				18	27		10.1016/j.vetmic.2015.10.012				JAN 15 2016	2016	To improve our understanding of squirrelpox virus (SQPV) infection in the susceptible host, three red squirrels were challenged with wild-type SQPV via scarification of the hind-limb skin. All squirrels seroconverted to the infection by the end of the experiment (17 days post-challenge). Challenged animals suffered disease characterised by the development of multiple skin and oral lesions with rapid progression of skin lesions at the infection site by day 10 post-challenge. No internal pathological changes were found at post-mortem examination. A novel SQPV Taqman (R) Real-time PCR detected viral DNA from multiple organs, with the largest amounts consistently associated with the primary and secondary skin and oral lesions where viral replication was most likely occurring. Immunohistochemistry clearly detected viral antigen in the stratified squamous epithelium of the epidermis, tongue and the oropharyngeal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and was consistently associated with histological changes resulting from viral replication. The lack of internal pathological changes and the detection of relatively low levels of viral DNA when compared with primary and secondary skin lesions argue against systemic disease, although systemic spread of the virus cannot be ruled out. This study allowed a comprehensive investigation of the clinical manifestation and progression of SQPV infection with a quantitative and qualitative analysis of virus dissemination and shedding. These findings suggest two separate routes of SQPV transmission under natural conditions, with both skin and saliva playing key roles in infected red squirrels. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Isolation of Getah virus from mosquitos collected on Hainan Island, China, and results of a serosurvey								Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health				23	4			730	734						1992	1992	An isolate of Getah virus was obtained from Culex mosquitos collected in Mao'an Village, Baoting County, Hainan Province, China, in 1964. The virus (strain M-1) replicated in laboratory-bred Aedes aegypti and Cx. fatigans (= quinquefasciatus), and was transmitted by laboratory-bred Ae. albopictus to healthy newborn albino mice. Skeletal muscles of newborn albino mice experimentally infected with the virus showed degeneration, atrophy, necrosis, and inflammatory changes of muscle fibers. Antibody prevalence in humans and animals ranged from 10.3% by neutralization tests of samples from healthy people in 1979 to 26.4% by CF tests of samples from people with febrile illnesses in 1982. The high prevalence of antibody in pigs, horses, and goats (17.6% to 37.5%) indicated that infection with Getah or a closely related virus is relatively common in domestic animals.

In this report, we define the transcriptome of MmuPV1 genome present in papillomas arising in experimentally infected mice using a combination of RNA-seq, PacBio Iso-seq, 5' RACE, 3' RACE, primer-walking RT-PCR, RNase protection, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. We demonstrate that the MmuPV1 genome is transcribed unidirectionally from five major promoters (P) or transcription start sites (TSS) and polyadenylates its transcripts at two major polyadenylation (pA) sites. We designate the P-7503, P-360 and P-859 as "early" promoters because they give rise to transcripts mostly utilizing the polyadenylation signal at nt 3844 and therefore can only encode early genes, and P-7107 and P-533 as "late" promoters because they give rise to transcripts utilizing polyadenylation signals at either nt 3844 or nt 7047, the latter being able to encode late, capsid proteins. MmuPV1 genome contains five splice donor sites and three acceptor sites that produce thirty-six RNA isoforms deduced to express seven predicted early gene products (E6, E7, E1, E1(boolean AND)M1, E1(boolean AND)M2, E2 and E8(boolean AND)E2) and three predicted late gene products (E1(boolean AND)E4, L2 and L1). The majority of the viral early transcripts are spliced once from nt 757 to 3139, while viral late transcripts, which are predicted to encode L1, are spliced twice, first from nt 7243 to either nt 3139 (P7107) or nt 757 to 3139 (P533) and second from nt 3431 to nt 5372. Thirteen of these viral transcripts were detectable by Northern blot analysis, with the P533-derived late E1(boolean AND)E4 transcripts being the most abundant. The late transcripts could be detected in highly differentiated keratinocytes of MmuPV1-infected tissues as early as ten days after MmuPV1 inoculation and correlated with detection of L1 protein and viral DNA amplification. In mature warts, detection of L1 was also found in more poorly differentiated cells, as previously reported. Subclinical infections were also observed. The comprehensive transcription map of MmuPV1 generated in this study provides further evidence that MmuPV1 is similar to high-risk cutaneous beta human papillomaviruses. The knowledge revealed will facilitate the use of MmuPV1 as an animal virus model for understanding of human papillomavirus gene expression, pathogenesis and immunology.

Patterns of infectious virus spread were studied by infectivity titrations in monkey kidney tissue cultures of . ground up tissues and organs of one suckling. Infectious virus was detectable in various tissues throughout the duration of the experiment. The greatest amounts of virus were found from the 7th to the 10th days after infection. The tissues most involved were brown fat, liver, spleen, small intestines and pancreas, and to a lesser extent, all 23 other tissues tested. No specific deaths were observed although some mice showed signs of infection, such as spastic gait, shivering, and roughening of fur coat. Viral antigen was found in some 20 different tissues and organs from the 3rd to the 14th day. The greatest amounts of antigen were detectable from the 6th to the 9th day. The tissues most involved were brown fat, white fat, salivary glands, skeletal muscle and the endothelial lining of blood vessels. There appeared to be direct correlation between infectivity and antigenicity. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19634100019620

The mortality rates of the F-1 hybrids and of the F-2 segregants showed the codominance of the susceptible and resistant characters. The direct individual intrapopulation correlation between the induction of antiviral state in macrophages activated by IFN gamma and the resistance to the virus infection, showed that an antiviral state could be induced in resistant mouse macrophages, whereas in susceptible mouse macrophages no restriction of virus replication could be observed. A direct inter- and intrapopulation correlation of pre-existing antibody titres against MHV3 with the mortality and a direct interpopulation correlation of those titres with the mean survival time of susceptible animals was shown. The data indicate, among the mechanisms of resistance against the virus infection, a role of IFN gamma macrophage-activation and of antibodies against MHV3 which may delay the mean survival time in susceptible animals.

The substance isolated from the leaves of Narcissus pseudonarcissus L. (NP) inhibits to a considerable extent the reproduction of different influenza viruses in tissue cultures. The antiviral effect of NP depends on the applied dose and the scheme used. The substance is most active when inoculated simultaneously and after the viral infection. The decrease in viral reproduction reaches 3.5 l g for A/PR8, 3 lg for A/Krasnodar, 2.5 lg for A/Gabrovo, 1.5 lg for A/Hong Kong.

J	Chiu, Elliott S.; McDonald, Coby A.; VandeWoude, Sue								Endogenous Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) siRNA Transcription May Interfere with Exogenous FeLV Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				95	23					e00070-21	10.1128/JVI.00070-21				DEC 2021	2021	Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are increasingly recognized for biological impacts on host cell function and susceptibility to infectious agents, particularly in relation to interactions with exogenous retroviral progenitors (XRVs). ERVs can simultaneously promote and restrict XRV infections using mechanisms that are virus and host specific. The majority of endogenous-exogenous retroviral interactions have been evaluated in experimental mouse or chicken systems, which are limited in their ability to extend findings to naturally infected outbred animals. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) has a relatively well-characterized endogenous retrovirus with a coexisting virulent exogenous counterpart and is endemic worldwide in domestic cats. We have previously documented an association between endogenous FeLV (enFeLV) long terminal repeat (LTR) copy number and abrogated exogenous FeLV in naturally infected cats and experimental infections in tissue culture. Analyses described here examine limited FeLV replication in experimentally infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which correlates with higher enFeLV transcripts in these cells compared to fibroblasts. We further examine NCBI Sequence Read Archive RNA transcripts to evaluate enFeLV transcripts and RNA interference (RNAi) precursors. We find that lymphoid-derived tissues, which are experimentally less permissive to exogenous FeLV infection, transcribe higher levels of enFeLV under basal conditions. Transcription of enFeLV-LTR segments is significantly greater than that of other enFeLV genes. We documented transcription of a 21-nucleotide (nt) microRNA (miRNA) just 3' to the enFeLV 5'-LTR in the feline miRNAome of all data sets evaluated (n = 27). Our findings point to important biological functions of enFeLV transcription linked to solo LTRs distributed within the domestic cat genome, with potential impacts on domestic cat exogenous FeLV susceptibility and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are increasingly implicated in host cellular processes and susceptibility to infectious agents, specifically regarding interactions with exogenous retroviral progenitors (XRVs). Exogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and its endogenous counterpart (enFeLV) represent a well-characterized, naturally occurring XRV-ERV dyad. We have previously documented an abrogated FeLV infection in both naturally infected cats and experimental fibroblast infections that harbor higher enFeLV proviral loads. Using an in silico approach, we provide evidence of miRNA transcription that is produced in tissues that are most important for FeLV infection, replication, and transmission. Our findings point to important biological functions of enFeLV transcription linked to solo-LTRs distributed within the feline genome, with potential impacts on domestic cat exogenous FeLV susceptibility and pathogenesis. This body of work provides additional evidence of RNA interference (RNAi) as a mechanism of viral interference and is a demonstration of ERV exaptation by the host to defend against related XRVs.

Furthermore, when MDP-Lys(L18) was administered p.o. (1 mg mouse(-1)), i.r. (300 mu g mouse(-1)) or intranasally (i.n., 100 mu g mouse(-1)) various days before Sendai virus infection (2.6 x 10(4) HAD mouse(-1)), all the mucosal administration of MDP-Lys(L18) significantly protected a lethal infection of Sendai virus, showing a dose-dependent manner. However, the efficacy of MDP-Lys(L18) to induce the prophylactic activity against the viruses somewhat varied according to the administration route and timing. In time course analysis of virus isolation in vivo, the mice administered with MDP-Lys(L18) exhibited a significant reduction of both viruses in the lungs for Sendai virus and in the bowels for rotavirus.

To investigate the role of MHC upregulation in IFN-gamma mediated antiviral effects in intraocular infection with HSV-1, we infected MHC deficient mice and mice with an additional ectopic site of IFN-gamma production in their retina (rho gamma) intravitreally with HSV-1 into one eye. Protective effects of IFN-gamma in intraocular HSV-1 infection were notable as sparing of the contralateral non-inoculated eye from retinitis, and were not dependent on MHC class I and class II expression, thus limiting the importance of MHC expression for the outcome of viral infection in vivo.

We identified lanthionine synthetase C-like 2 (LANCL2) as a new therapeutic target for immunoinflammatory diseases. To examine the therapeutic efficacy of oral NSC61610 administration on influenza, we infected C57BL/6 mice with influenza A H1N1pdm virus and evaluated influenza-related mortality, lung inflammatory profiles, and pulmonary histopathology. Oral treatment with NSC61610 ameliorates influenza virus infection by down-modulating pulmonary inflammation through the downregulation of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 and reduction in the infiltration of neutrophils. NSC61610 treatment increases IL10-producing CD8+ T cells and macrophages in the lungs during the resolution phase of disease. The loss of LANCL2 or neutralization of IL-10 in mice infected with influenza virus abrogates the ability of NSC61610 to accelerate recovery and induce IL-10-mediated regulatory responses. These studies validate that oral treatment with NSC61610 ameliorates morbidity and mortality and accelerates recovery during influenza virus infection through a mechanism mediated by activation of LANCL2 and subsequent induction of IL-10 responses by CD8+ T cells and macrophages in the lungs.

The N-6-methyladenosine (m(6)A) of RNA is a common RNA modification involved in various biological events. METTL3 is an m(6)A methyltransferase that regulates EV-71 replication. EV-71 infection induces autophagy, which also promotes EV-71 replication. In this study, we explored the role of METTL3 in EV-71 infection-induced autophagy. We constructed lentivirus expressing METTL3-specific shRNA and knocked down the endogenous METTL3 in mouse Schwann cells. We infected normal Schwann cells and METTL3 knockdown Schwann cells and compared the viral titer, expression of autophagy-related proteins and apoptosis-related protein. Transduction of lentivirus expressing METTL3 shRNA significantly decreased the endogenous METTL3. Knocking down METTL3 decreased the viral titer of EV-71 after infection. Knocking down METTL3 prevented EV-71-induced cell death and suppressed EV-71-induced expression of Bax while rescuing Bcl-2 expression after EV-71 infection. Knocking down METTL3 inhibited EV-71-induced expression of Atg5, Atg7 and LC3 II. Knocking down METTL3 inhibited EV-71-induced apoptosis and autophagy. In summary, our study describes the relationship of METTL3 and autophagy during EV-71 infection.This study describes the relationship of METTL3 and autophagy during EV-71 infection.

Histopathology of guinea-pigs experimentally infected with the virus								VIRUS [KYOTO UNIV]				3	(3)			173	177						1953	1953	Guinea-pigs which failed to exhibit any clinical signs of encephalitis by the admn. of Japanese B encephalitis virus by any route were infected exptlly. by the intracerebral or intramusc. route and the infected tissues were examined histologically. The animals reacted to the virus with generalized mesenchymal tissue reaction which could be pursued in almost all the organs. In the brain, however, no histol. changes were observed after infection by any route except intracerebral inoculation, and by the latter route the glial reaction and the round-cell infiltration in the meninges or in Virchow-Robin spaces could be elicited, but the nerve cell degeneration was not present. In other words, the features of neurotropism of the virus was not observed, at least in guinea-pigs. Histol. findings in other organs were round-cell infiltration in the endocardium or myocardium, so-called interstitial pneumonia, fatty degeneration of Kupffer-cell proliferation of the liver, marrow cell proliferation and follicle reaction of the spleen or lymphatic glands, and slight interstitial round-cell infiltration of kidney. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. abst																					BCI:BCI19542800021431

The animals were infected with influenza A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus in a dose of 1 or 10 LD50. GA (10 mg/kg body weight) and EW (0.1, 10, and 1000 mu g/kg) alone or in combination were intraperitoneally injected for 5 days, starting on day 1 of virus infection. Rimantadine 50 mg/kg/day was used as a comparison drug. The combination of EW (1000 mu g/kg) and GA (10 mg/kg) was ascertained to exert the maximum protective effect manifesting itself in reducing the death of infected animals (by 75-79% compared to the control depending on the viral dose) and the titers of viruses accumulated in the lung (5-6 log EID50) and in preventing lung tissue edema and inflammation. The noted effect was comparable with that seen in the use of rimantadine. The agents used alone had a lower efficacy than rimantadine. The findings permit the combination of GA and EW to be considered to be a promising agent for the treatment of influenza.																					BCI:BCI201200645464	22905423

Sally; Taubenberger, Jeffery K.; Bray, Mike								The use of nonhuman primates in research on seasonal, pandemic and avian influenza, 1893-2014								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				117				75	98		10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.02.011				MAY 2015	2015	Attempts to reproduce the features of human influenza in laboratory animals date from the early 1890s, when Richard Pfeiffer inoculated apes with bacteria recovered from influenza patients and produced a mild respiratory illness. Numerous studies employing nonhuman primates (NHPs) were performed during the 1918 pandemic and the following decade. Most used bacterial preparations to infect animals, but some sought a filterable agent for the disease. Since the viral etiology of influenza was established in the early 1930s, studies in NHPs have been supplemented by a much larger number of experiments in mice, ferrets and human volunteers. However, the emergence of a novel swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus in 1976 and the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in 1997 stimulated an increase in NHP research, because these agents are difficult to study in naturally infected patients and cannot be administered to human volunteers. In this paper, we review the published literature on the use of NHPs in influenza research from 1893 through the end of 2014. The first section summarizes observational studies of naturally occurring influenza-like syndromes in wild and captive primates, including serologic investigations. The second provides a chronological account of experimental infections of NHPs, beginning with Pfeiffer's study and covering all published research on seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, including vaccine and antiviral drug testing. The third section reviews experimental infections of NHPs with avian influenza viruses that have caused disease in humans since 1997. The paper concludes with suggestions for further studies to more clearly define and optimize the role of NHPs as experimental animals for influenza research.

Although index infections are rarely observable in nature, exper-imental inoculations of pathogens into novel host species provide a rich and largely unexploited data source for meta-analyses to identify the host and pathogen determinants of variability in infection outcomes. We analyzed the progressions of 514 experimental cross-species inoculations of rabies virus, a widespread zoonosis which in nature exhibits both dead-end infections and varying levels of sustained transmission in novel hosts. Inoculations originating from bats rather than carnivores, and from warmerto cooler-bodied species caused infections with shorter incubation periods that were associated with diminished virus excretion. Inoculations between distantly related hosts tended to result in shorter clinical disease periods, which are also expected to impede onward transmission. All effects were modulated by infection dose. Taken together, these results suggest that as host species become more dissimilar, increased virulence might act as a limiting factor preventing onward transmission. These results can explain observed constraints on rabies virus host shifts, describe a previously unrecognized role of host body temperature, and provide a potential explanation for host shifts being less likely between genetically distant species. More generally, our study highlights meta-analyses of experimental infections as a tractable approach to quantify the complex interactions between virus, reservoir, and novel host that shape the outcome of cross-species transmission.

Strain- and Age-Associated Variation in Viral Persistence and Antibody Response to Mouse Parvovirus 1 in Experimentally Infected Mice								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE				49	4			443	447						JUL 2010	2010	The effect of mouse strain and age at infection on viral replication and concurrent antibody response to mouse parvovirus 1 (isolate MPV1f) was evaluated for 305 d after inoculation in 4 strains of mice. The results confirmed previous reports that mouse strain and age at infection are significant factors in viral persistence and antibody development and detection. Random-bred Arc:Arc(s) mice originally bred from CD1 stock inoculated as juveniles (4 wk) or adults (8 wk) developed persistent viral infection for 152 d after inoculation and an antibody response that persisted for 295 d. Mice of C57BL/6J background inoculated as juveniles had detectable viral DNA in large intestinal content and tissues for 24 d after inoculation and an antibody response that persisted for 288 d. However, viral DNA was not detected in tissues of C57BL/6J mice inoculated as adults, although an antibody was detected for 111 d after inoculation; these results suggest probable viral replication in adult C57BL/6J mice but at levels below the limits of detection. BALB/cArc mice inoculated as juveniles or adults had detectable virus DNA in tissues for 108 to 242 d after inoculation, but no antibody was detected. Similarly, BALB/c-Foxn1(nu)/Arc mice had detectable levels of viral DNA in tissues for 98 to 131 d but no measurable antibody. The difficulty of detecting antibody in mice with a BALB/c background indicates they are unsuitable for routine surveillance of MPV1f infection.																					WOS:000280537800010	20819390

The clinical manifestations of DEN are variable, and the disease may present subclinically or asymptomatically. A quarter of patients develop classical dengue (CD) or severe dengue (SD), which is potentially lethal and involves vascular permeability changes, severe hemorrhage and organ damage. The involvement of the liver is a fairly common feature in DEN, and alterations range from asymptomatic elevation of transaminases to acute liver failure. Since its introduction in Brazil in 1990, two strains of Dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 (DENV-2) have been detected: Lineage I, which is responsible for an outbreak in 1991, and Lineage II, which caused an epidemic greater than the previous one and had a different epidemiological profile. To date, studies on different strains of the same serotype/genotype and their association with disease severity are scarce. In addition, one of the greatest challenges regarding the study of DEN pathogenesis and the development of drug and vaccine therapies is the absence of an animal model that reproduces the disease as it occurs in humans. The main goals of this study were to assess BALB/c mouse susceptibility experimentally infected by two distinct DENV-2 strains and characterize possible differences in the clinical signs and alterations induced in the liver resulting from those infections. Mice infected by the two DENV-2 lineages gained less weight than uninfected mice; however, their livers were slightly heavier. Increased AST and AST levels were observed in infected mice, and the number of platelets increased in the first 72 h of infection and subsequently decreased. Mice infected with both lineages presented leukocytosis but at different times of infection. The histopathological changes induced by both lineages were similar and comparable to the changes observed in DEN fatal cases. The viral genome was detected in two liver samples. The results demonstrate the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to both DENV-2 lineages and suggest that the changes induced by those strains are similar, although for some parameters, they are manifested at different times of infection.

The cytopathic agent was passaged and 8th passage material was used for further experiments. Experimental transmission was achieved in cats (but not in mice, guineapigs, rabbits or hamsters) by ocular or intranasal inoculation. Multiplication of the virus was not achieved in other tissue cultures or in 7 to 11-day embryonated eggs. Neutralization tests with immune sera against a number of viruses isolated from cats gave negative results. Positive results were obtained with the serum of a cat surviving natural infection; of cats surviving experimental infection; and of 3 of 8 apparently healthy cats. A hyperimmune serum was prepared in rabbits by i/v injection of stock virus. Pathological findings and cytopathic effects were in no way similar to those produced by any of the known viruses of cats.

We analyzed microscopic vascular alterations, cell proliferation and death by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of IFN-gamma,TNF-alpha. and the IL-10 by qPCR and flow cytometry. Infected mice showed slight respiratory signs and ruffled fur during the first two days post-infection. Virus isolation and DNA detection were positive only in the lungs of the infected mice. Vascular congestion, increase in the labyrinth area, and a significant reduction in fetal capillary endothelium surface of infected placentas were found. Cell proliferation was significantly reduced in the infected placentas, whereas the apoptosis was significantly increased. 110, TNF and IFN-gamma showed different expression in the infected placentas and uteri. The effects of EHV-1 during pregnancy depend on different pathogenic mechanisms in which vascular alterations, and cell death and proliferation and local cytokine changes are compromised.

The sequential changes in PBL subset population with considerable decrease in CD8+ ratio (30.5 to 1.26) in the post-infection period of lambs were significant.

Serum specimens obtained from cynomolgus macaques experimentally infected with strains from Burma, Mexico, or Pakistan cross-neutralized the infectivity of each strain as well as an isolate from Morocco. Serum samples obtained either from infected patients who reside in HEV-endemic regions of the world or from U.S. residents who became infected while traveling to such regions also neutralized all four strains. In contrast, antibodies obtained from rabbits immunized with full-length Burma strain ORF2 protein neutralized only the Burma and Pakistan strains, not the Mexico or Morocco strains. In addition, antibodies obtained from guinea pigs immunized with an N-terminal truncated Burma strain ORF2 protein neutralized each strain except the Morocco strain. These data strongly suggest that antibodies elicited during an HEV infection demonstrate broad HEV neutralizing activity, whereas antibodies elicited after immunization with recombinant Burma ORF2 protein demonstrate a more limited ability to neutralize various HEV strains obtained from different regions of the world endemic for the disease.

The measured variables include: the PCV2 virus load in liver, spleen, heart, lung, kidney, ovary and serum on 3rd, 5th, 7th, 4th and 11th day post infection (dpi); serum Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha), Interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) levels on 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th dpi; serum Total Superoxide Dismutase (T-SOD) activity on 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th dpi. Results showed that arginine supplementation could significantly increase the serum IL-2 levels on the 4th and 11th dpi; significantly increase the serum IFN-a and CRP levels on the 11th dpi; significantly increase the serum IFN-r levels on the 7th dpi and significantly decrease the serum IL-6 levels on the 9th dpi. Meanwhile, the PCV2 virus genome was detected sporadically. Collectively, dietary L-arginine supplementation had beneficial effects on the cytokines profile in the PCV2 infected mouse and maybe could delay the PCV2 replication and/or clear the PCV2 in mouse model.

Reovirus-Induced Apoptosis in the Intestine Limits Establishment of Enteric Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				92	10					e02062-17	10.1128/JVI.02062-17				MAY 2018	2018	Several viruses induce intestinal epithelial cell death during enteric infection. However, it is unclear whether proapoptotic capacity promotes or inhibits replication in this tissue. We infected mice with two reovirus strains that infect the intestine but differ in the capacity to alter immunological tolerance to new food antigen. Infection with reovirus strain T1L, which induces an inflammatory immune response to fed antigen, is prolonged in the intestine, whereas T3D-RV, which does not induce this response, is rapidly cleared from the intestine. Compared with T1L, T3D-RV infection triggered apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells and subsequent sloughing of dead cells into the intestinal lumen. We conclude that the infection advantage of T1L derives from its capacity to subvert host restriction by epithelial cell apoptosis, providing a possible mechanism by which T1L enhances inflammatory signals during antigen feeding. Using a panel of T1L x T3D-RV reassortant viruses, we identified the viral M1 and M2 gene segments as determinants of reovirus-induced apoptosis in the intestine. Expression of the T1L M1 and M2 genes in a T3D-RV background was sufficient to limit epithelial cell apoptosis and enhance viral infection to levels displayed by T1L. These findings define additional reovirus gene segments required for enteric infection of mice and illuminate the antiviral effect of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis in limiting enteric viral infection. Viral strain-specific differences in the capacity to infect the intestine may be useful in identifying viruses capable of ameliorating tolerance to fed antigen in autoimmune conditions like celiac disease.IMPORTANCE Acute viral infections are thought to be cleared by the host with few lasting consequences. However, there may be much broader and long-lasting effects of viruses on immune homeostasis. Infection with reovirus, a common, nonpathogenic virus, triggers inflammation against innocuous food antigens, implicating this virus in the development of celiac disease, an autoimmune intestinal disorder triggered by exposure to dietary gluten. Using two reovirus strains that differ in the capacity to abrogate oral tolerance, we found that strain-specific differences in the capacity to replicate in the intestine inversely correlate with the capacity to induce apoptotic death of intestinal epithelial cells, providing a host-mediated process to restrict intestinal infection. This work contributes new knowledge about virus-host interactions in the intestine and establishes a foundation for future studies to define mechanisms by which viruses break oral tolerance in celiac disease.

Experimental infection produced by influenza virus and corticosteroids [English summ.]								BRASIL MED				76	(7/8)			187	192						1962	1962	The effects of some corticosteroids on white mice experimentally infected with the A strain PR8 of influenza virus, were investigated. Hydrocortisone and prednisolone separately increased resistance of animals. Dexamethasone and cortisone did not affect the lethal index; but the enlargement of the curves indicates a greater increase of resistance to infection than in the control animals. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19634300020397

Natural Secretory Immunoglobulins Promote Enteric Viral Infections								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				92	23					e00826-18	10.1128/JVI.00826-18				DEC 2018	2018	Noroviruses are enteric pathogens causing significant morbidity, mortality, and economic losses worldwide. Secretory immunoglobulins (sIg) are a first line of mucosal defense against enteric pathogens. They are secreted into the intestinal lumen via the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), where they bind to antigens. However, whether natural sIg protect against norovirus infection remains unknown. To determine if natural sIg alter murine norovirus (MNV) pathogenesis, we infected pIgR knockout (KO) mice, which lack sIg in mucosal secretions. Acute MNV infection was significantly reduced in pIgR KO mice compared to controls, despite increased MNV target cells in the Peyer's patch. Natural sIg did not alter MNV binding to the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) or crossing of the FAE into the lymphoid follicle. Instead, naive pIgR KO mice had enhanced levels of the antiviral inflammatory molecules interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the ileum compared to controls. Strikingly, depletion of the intestinal microbiota in pIgR KO and control mice resulted in comparable IFN-gamma and iNOS levels, as well as MNV infectious titers. IFN-gamma treatment of wild-type (WT) mice and neutralization of IFN-gamma in pIgR KO mice modulated MNV titers, implicating the antiviral cytokine in the phenotype. Reduced gastrointestinal infection in pIgR KO mice was also observed with another enteric virus, reovirus. Collectively, our findings suggest that natural sIg are not protective during enteric virus infection, but rather, that sIg promote enteric viral infection through alterations in microbial immune responses.IMPORTANCE Enteric virus, such as norovirus, infections cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, direct antiviral infection prevention strategies are limited. Blocking host entry and initiation of infection provides an established avenue for intervention. Here, we investigated the role of the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR)-secretory immunoglobulin (sIg) cycle during enteric virus infections. The innate immune functions of sIg (agglutination, immune exclusion, neutralization, and expulsion) were not required during control of acute murine norovirus (MNV) infection. Instead, lack of pIgR resulted in increased IFN-gamma levels, which contributed to reduced MNV titers. Another enteric virus, reovirus, also showed decreased infection in pIgR KO mice. Collectively, our data point to a model in which sIg-mediated microbial sensing promotes norovirus and reovirus infection. These data provide the first evidence of the proviral role of natural sIg during enteric virus infections and provide another example of how intestinal bacterial communities indirectly influence MNV pathogenesis.

Osong public health and research perspectives				2	1			15	22		10.1016/j.phrp.2011.04.005				2011-Jun	2011	OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the pathogenesis and chronologic localization of human influenza A (H1N1) virus in experimentally infected cotton rats.METHODS: The animals were intranasally inoculated with 10(7) plaque-forming units of A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 (H1N1) influenza virus and evaluated for pathogenicity for a period of 28days. Virus replication kinetics and pathological properties were assessed chronologically. Acute antiviral responses were evaluated by mean of real-time polymerase chain reaction.RESULTS: Cotton rats infected with A/Solomon Islands/3/2006 virus lost weight until 6days post-inoculation (DPI) and showed decreased activity until 3 DPI. At necropsy, focal areas of redness and consolidation of lungs were evident at 1, 2, and 3 DPI. Lung histopathology showed moderate to severe interstitial pneumonia, alveolitis and bronchiolitis. Influenza A specific viral protein was detected in bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar septa and pneumocytes. Influenza viruses were recovered from the lungs during the early period of infection and the titer peaked at 1 DPI. Viral proteins were detected from 4hours to 6hours DPI. These trends correlate with the up-regulation of mRNA expression of the IFN-alpha, Mx1, and Mx2 genes that play critical roles in the anti-influenza response at the early stage of infection.CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence that supports the use of cotton rats for the study of influenza virus pathogenesis and the immune response.

A series of experiments were staged to clarify: (1) Taking in of the virus while feeding on a sick animal (69 experiments); (2) Duration of the virus presence in mites (63 experiments); (3) virus transmission during bloodsucking (36 experiments). During bloodsucking the gamasids were capable of taking in the virus (positive results were obtained in 4 tests on 2 groups of D. gallinae, fed on an infected chicken, and upon 2 groups of O. bacoti, fed on infected albino mice). However, under the conditions of the experiment, the virus of strains tested failed to show specific relations with and did not multiply in the body of the mite species under examination. In their experiments the authors did not find the virus in the mites during the digestion of the blood, nor after its termination. The authors regard the above experiments as preliminary. Further investigation should be conducted to disclose gamasids as carriers of various types and strains of virus particularly those of high intensity, making use of wild animals and particularly birds. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ. transl																					BCI:BCI19634100008190	14010121

We infected WT mice with IAV as a normal respiratory virus group. During analysis, we found that S100A8 was dramatically upregulated by SARS-CoV-2 and a mouse coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV), but not by other tested viruses. A group of non-canonical neutrophils were also activated during SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall design: WT Rhesus macaques were infected with SARS-CoV-2 intranasally. Lungs were harvested at 0 dpi, 3 dpi, and 5 dpi. RNA extracted from lungs and RNASeq was performed to identify differentially expressed genes. WT C57BL/6J mice and hACE2 transgenic mice were infected with IAV and MHV intranasally. Lungs were harvested at 0 hour, 6 hour, 24 hour, 48hour, 3day, 5day, 7 day post-infection.

J	VONDERFECHT S L; EIDEN J J; MISKUFF R L; YOLKEN R H								KINETICS OF INTESTINAL REPLICATION OF GROUP B ROTAVIRUS AND RELEVANCE TO DIAGNOSTIC METHODS								Journal of Clinical Microbiology				26	2			215	221						1988	1988	Non-group-A rotaviruses have been implicated with increasing frequency as causes of acute gastroenteritis in humans and other animals. However, the incidence and significance of infection with these agents, as well as appropriate diagnostic strategies for making these determinations, are largely unknown. Studies to make these determinations could be more accurately conducted if the relationship between the viral replication kinetics and the particular diagnostic method used is understood. We thus utilized the murine model of group B rotavirus infection to establish the viral replication kinetics by a variety of commonly used diagnostic methods. Enzyme immunoassay, routine negative-stain electron microscopy, solid-phase immunosorbent electron microscopy, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and a dot hybridization assay were used in these studies. By enzyme immunoassay, 100% of experimentally infected suckling rats tested positive for group B rotaviral antigens at 1, 4, and 5 days postinoculation. However, only 70 and 20% of infected animals tested positive at days 2 and 3 postinoculation, respectively. Dot hybridization with a complementary DNA probe also suggested a biphasic pattern of viral antigen excretion. Evidence of the virus causing infectious diarrhea in infants rats was found only on day 1 postinoculation in samples examined by routine negative-stain electron microscopy and by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Rotaviruslike particles were observed by solid-phase immunosorbent electron microscopy on days 1, 2, and 4 after viral inoculation suckling rats but were clearly the most numerous on day 1. Additionally, the enzyme immunoassay was used to quantitate the kinetics of group B rotaviral replication in the intestines of the experimentally infected animals. Levels of murine group B rotaviral antigens in intestinal samples peaked on days 1 and 4 postinoculation; however, only peak 1 represented actual intraepithelial replication of the virus. These studies thus indicate that early sample collection and selection of the appropriate diagnostic method are critical if the incidence and significance of group B and possibly other non-group-A rotaviral infections are to be accurately assessed.

Before rechallenge, beta(2)m knockout mice had high levels of intestinal rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A. These findings suggest that CTLs mediate rotavirus clearance but are not required for this function and that CTLs are not necessary for development of immunity to rotavirus reinfection, To further characterize the effector mechanisms involved in clearance and prevention of rotavirus infection, similar studies were performed with B-cell deficient J(H)D knockout mice. After primary infection, most naive J(H)D mice had similar virus-shedding clearance curves as did control mice and completely resolved primary infection. However, 2 of 29 became chronically infected. All J(H)D mice treated with anti-CD8 antibody became chronically infected with murine rotavirus. Upon rechallenge, J(H)D mice which had cleared primary infection were all susceptible to reinfection, These findings suggest that B cells also play a role in clearance of primary infection but are absolutely necessary for development of immunity against rotavirus reinfection.

A number of studies have shown that T cells may be important for mediating demyelination, but the role of T cells is still, unclear. Here, we show that neuronal necrosis, but not demyelination, was more severe in interleukin (IL)-12-defective mice compared with wild-type mice and this correlated with higher virus titers in the brain. In contrast, the severity of demyelination and neuronal depletion was reduced in IL-4-defective mice and this correlated with reduced brain virus titers and enhanced SFV-specific IFN-gamma production. The findings indicate that type I T cells play a role in the control of SFV replication but not directly in SFV-induced pathology in the CNS. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Prolonged virus shedding is detected in the excreta of these rodents and can result in efficient transmission to other members of the host species. Extensive spillover infection into other rodent species can be seen at times of high virus activity in the primary rodent-host species, but these instances result in acute infections which are more quickly cleared. Spillover infections provide the potential for genetic interaction of different hantaviruses during co-infection of the same rodent-host cell. Hantavirus genetic reassortants can be observed both in naturally infected rodents and mixed hantavirus infection of tissue culture cells, but appear to be restricted to closely related viruses. This pattern is due to the much lower frequency of naturally occurring contact of viruses belonging to different rodent-host species, and the lower viability of virus reassortants of more genetically diverse backgrounds. These features of the hantavirus biology are reflected in the close phylogenetic relationships of hantaviruses and their primary rodent-reservoir hosts. The viruses appear to have co-evolved with their rodent hosts over the past 30 million years or so, with only infrequent virus host-switching events having occurred.					2nd Symposium on Emerging Diseases2nd Symposium on Emerging Diseases	OCT 28-31, 1998OCT 28-31, 1998	Marcel Merieux FdnMarcel Merieux Fdn	ANNECY LE VIEUX, FRANCEANNECY LE VIEUX, FRANCE													WOS:000086564100011

A phylogenetic analysis showed that these isolates originated from gene reassortment among different virus lineages of the H6 subtype. In an experimental infection of animals, the selected isolate was non-pathogenic for chickens and low-pathogenic for mice. The wild-type isolate was capable of replication in mouse lung without prior adaptation, and the virulence to mice increased rapidly during adaption in mouse lung. The genomes of viruses of passage 0 (P0), P4, and P8 were sequenced and compared, and virulence-related amino acid substitutions were found in multiple sites during mouse lung passage.

VIRCHOWS ARCHIV				442	6			591	596		10.1007/s00428-003-0795-1				JUN 2003	2003	A method was developed for detection of influenza genes in formalin-fixed brains of mice that had been experimentally infected with influenza A/NWS/33 (H1N1) virus. Using this technique, messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) of the P-actin gene was detected in eight clinical brain samples from the 1916-1920 outbreak of encephalitis lethargica, showing preservation of particular mRNAs. However, we did not detect influenza nucleotide sequences of M, NP, and NS genes from these same samples. We conclude either that influenza was not the causative agent of encephalitis lethargica or, possibly, that the virus had a hit-and-run mechanism and was no longer present in the brain at the time of death of the patients.

In the present article, we sought to identify neutralization epitopes of SIVmac envelope surface glycoprotein (gp130). Algorithms were used to predict antigenicity of specific regions. Four regions from the primary amino acid sequence of the viral surface glycoprotein were selected. A synthetic peptide representing one of these regions (414-434) induced virus-neutralizing antibodies in mice; in addition, this peptide induced T cell-proliferative responses in macaques. To address the in vivo relevance of these observations, we demonstrated that experimentally infected macaques produce antibodies to the neutralization epitope. In addition, rhesus macaques protected against infection by an inactivated SIV vaccine develop antibodies that bind to peptide 414-434. These observations demonstrate that the region that includes the sequence 414-434 in the fourth variable domain (V4) of SIVmac gp130 contains both a linear neutralization epitope and a T cell epitope.

Microglia Do Not Restrict SARS-CoV-2 Replication following Infection of the Central Nervous System of K18-Human ACE2 Transgenic Mice								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				96	4					e01969					FEB 2022	2022	Unlike SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, infection with SARS-CoV-2, the viral pathogen responsible for COVID-19, is often associated with neurologic symptoms that range from mild to severe, yet increasing evidence argues the virus does not ex-hibit extensive neuroinvasive properties. We demonstrate SARS-CoV-2 can infect and replicate in human iPSC-derived neurons and that infection shows limited antiviral and inflammatory responses but increased activation of EIF2 signaling following infection as determined by RNA sequencing. Intranasal infection of K18 human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in lung pathology associated with viral replication and immune cell infiltration. In addition, similar to 50% of infected mice exhibited CNS infection characterized by wide-spread viral replication in neurons accompanied by increased expression of chemokine (Cxcl9, Cxcl10, Ccl2, Ccl5 and Ccl19) and cytokine (Ifn-lambda and Tnf-alpha) transcripts associated with microgliosis and a neuroinflammatory response consisting primarily of monocytes/macrophages. Micro-glia depletion via administration of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor, PLX5622, in SARS-CoV-2 infected mice did not affect survival or viral replication but did result in dampened expression of proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine transcripts and a reduction in monocyte/macrophage infiltration. These results argue that microglia are dispensable in terms of controlling SARS-CoV-2 replication in in the K18-hACE2 model but do contribute to an inflammatory response through expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Collectively, these findings contribute to previous work dem-onstrating the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect neurons as well as emphasizing the potential use of the K18-hACE2 model to study immunological and neuropathological aspects related to SARS-CoV-2-induced neurologic disease.IMPORTANCE Understanding the immunological mechanisms contributing to both host defense and disease following viral infection of the CNS is of critical importance given the increasing number of viruses that are capable of infecting and replicating within the nervous system. With this in mind, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of microglia in aiding in host defense following experimental infection of the central nervous system (CNS) of K18-hACE2 with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Neurologic symptoms that range in severity are common in COVID-19 patients and understanding immune responses that contribute to restricting neurologic disease can provide important insight into better understanding consequences associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the CNS.

One major limitation in this process is the lack of accessible human orthopoxvirus infections for clinical efficacy trials; however, drug licensure can be based on orthopoxvirus animal challenge models as described in the "Animal Efficacy Rule". One such challenge model uses ectromelia virus, an orthopoxvirus, whose natural host is the mouse and is the etiological agent of mousepox. The genetic similarity of ectromelia virus to variola and monkeypox viruses, the common features of the resulting disease, and the convenience of the mouse as a laboratory animal underscores its utility in the study of orthopoxvirus pathogenesis and in the development of therapeutics and prophylactics. In this review we outline how mousepox has been used as a model for smallpox. We also discuss mousepox in the context of mouse strain, route of infection, infectious dose, disease progression, and recovery from infection.																					WOS:000282216100005	21994714

A/J-mice experimentally hyperimmunized with inactivated MHV3 (A/Ji) became resistant to challenge with this virus. BALB/c mice free of (BALB/c-) or naturally infected with (BALB/c+) coronavirus, or hyperimmunized with inactivated MHV3 (BALB/ci), were always fully susceptible. All susceptible mice developed an acute hepatitis with a high virus titre in the tissues. Resistance mice developed a mild disease in which the low virus titres detected in the tissues were cleared. After infection, interferon (IFN)-gamma synthesis in A/J-mice was lower than that in A/J+ and A/Ji mice; IFN-gamma synthesis was very high in BALB/c+ and BALB/ci mice, but low in BALB/c- mice. Studies of the anti-MHV3 effect induced in macrophages in vitro showed that only IFN-gamma-activated A/J mouse macrophages were able to restrict partially the growth of MHV3, regardless of whether the animals had been immunized. The effect occurred only when the cells were activated with IFN-gamma before virus infection. The results indicate that the resistance of A/J mice to our strain of MHV3 is not natural but is acquired after immunization, and that the mechanism involved is dependent on T cell activity, IFN-gamma production and the sensitivity of macrophages to IFN-gamma.

Analysis of single memory B cells from immunized human donors has led us to characterize a previously unrecognized epitope of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) that is immunogenic in humans and conserved among influenza subtypes. Structures show that an unrelated antibody from a participant in an experimental infection protocol recognized the epitope as well. IgGs specific for this antigenic determinant do not block viral infection in vitro, but passive administration to mice affords robust IgG subtype-dependent protection against influenza infection. The epitope, occluded in the pre-fusion form of HA, is at the contact surface between HA head domains; reversible molecular "breathing" of the HA trimer can expose the interlace to antibody and B cells. Antigens that present this broadly immunogenic HA epitope may be good candidates for inclusion in "universal" flu vaccines.																					WOS:000468103800008	31100267

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				38	3			202	205						2016	2016	A disease suspected with pseudorabies had occurred in a large number of raccoon dog herds in China since 2014. To investigate the causative agent, we isolated a virus from the brain tissue of a dead raccoon dog and the virus produced the herpes virus like typical cytopathogenic effect in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. The mature virions with envelope in a diameter of 150 nm to 180 nm were observed under transmission electron microscopy. The virus was also sensitive to chloroform and trypsin, and tolerance to pH 5 to 9. In addition, the positive results for pseudorabies virus (PRV) were detected by immunofluorescence assay and PCR. Furthermore, the rabbits and mice injected with this virus developed typical clinical symptoms of pseudorabies when artificially infected with the virus. All the evidences indicated that the isolated virus was PRV and named Rac 1. This study provided references for raccoon dog pseudorabies prevention and control.

Infection of deer mice results in persistence without conspicuous pathology, and most, if not all, infected mice remain infected for life, with periods of viral shedding. The kinetics of viral load, histopathology, virus distribution, and immune gene expression in deer mice were examined. Viral antigen was detected as early as 5 days postinfection and peaked on day 15 in the lungs, hearts, kidneys, and livers. Viral RNA levels varied substantially but peaked on day 15 in the lungs and heart, and antinucleocapsid IgG antibodies appeared in some animals on day 10, but a strong neutralizing antibody response failed to develop during the 20-day experiment. No clinical signs of disease were observed in any of the infected deer mice. Most genes were repressed on day 2, suggesting a typical early downregulation of gene expression often observed in viral infections. Several chemokine and cytokine genes were elevated, and markers of a T cell response occurred but then declined days later. Splenic transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) expression was elevated early in infection, declined, and then was elevated again late in infection. Together, these data suggest that a subtle immune response that fails to clear the virus occurs in deer mice.																					WOS:000308337500043	22787210

Fruit bats, living in vast areas extending from India to the western Pacific, were identified as the natural reservoir of the virus. However, the mechanisms that resulted in severe pathogenicity in humans (up to 70% mortality) and that enabled crossing the species barrier were not known. In this study, we established a system that enabled the rescue of, replicating NiVs from a cloned DNA by cotransfection of a constructed full-length cDNA clone and supporting plasmids coding virus nucleoprotein, phosphoprotein, and polymerase with the infection of the recombinant vaccinia virus, MVAGKT7, expressing T7 RNA polymerase. The rescued NiV (rNiV), by using the newly developed reverse genetics system, showed properties in vitro that were similar to the parent virus and retained the severe pathogenicity in a previously established animal model by experimental infection. A recombinant NiV was also developed, expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rNiV-EGFP). Using the virus, permissibility of NiV was compared with the presence of a known cellular receptor, ephrin 132, in a number of cell lines of different origins. Interestingly, two cell lines expressing ephrin 132 were not susceptible for rNiV-EGFP, indicating that additional factors are clearly required for full NiV replication. The reverse genetics for NiV will provide a powerful tool for the analysis of the molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity and cross-species infection.																					WOS:000241879500079	17053073	
J	PARK Y-M; HA T-Y; PARK B-S								ENHANCING EFFECT OF IL-2 IFN-GAMMA AND POLY-A POLY-U ON GROWTH INHIBITION OF MURINE LYMPHOCYTES AGAINST CRYPTOCOCCUS-NEOFORMANS								Journal of the Korean Society for Microbiology				26	1			105	116						1991	1991	Natural cell-mediated cytotoxicity (NCMC) has been identified as one of the body's first lines of defense against neoplastic cells, and NCMC functions in some viral infections and in regulating the development and differentiation of normal tissues. Natural killer (NK) cells has been shown to be one of the effector cells in this natural surveillance system. In rodents, highest NK cell activity is present in the spleen and peripheral blood, and thymus is virtually devoid of NK cell activity. NK activity is first detectable between 3 and 5 week age and is relatively high between 6 and 8 week and then decline to a low level. Previous reports have demonstrated NK cells to exert growth inhibiting effects against Cryptococcus neogormans. In the present study interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon-.gamma. (IFN-.gamma.), polyadenylic-polyuridylic acid[poly (A) .cntdot. poly (U)], a potent IFN inducer, estradiol, a female sex hormone, were employed for the assay of the effects on C. neoformans growth inhibition by lymphoid cells in vitro and in vivo. Growth inhibition was evaluated by the inhibition of microcolony growth of the ungus on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Lymphoid cells from BALB/c mice showed little or no fungal growth inhibitory activity. However, fungal growth inhibition was enhanced by lymphoid cells cultured in the presence of IL-2 or IFN-.gamma.. Growth inhibitory activity was dependent upon their concentrations. In the clearance study, mice were treated intraperitoneally every day with IL-2 (103 U/day) or poly (A) .cntdot. poly (U) (100 .mu.g/day), beginning 1 day before intravenous inoculation with C. neoformans and continuing 3 days after its inoculation, and colony forming units (CFU) per organ was enumerated. The mice that had received IL-2 or poly (A) .cntdot. poly (U) cleared C. neoformans from their organs effectively than did the control mice, especially poly (A) .cntdot. (U)-treated group of mice highly enhanced the clearance. Furthermore, IL-2 administration caused the enhancement of survival of mice that had been experimentally infected with C. neoformans. Estradiol-treated group of mice cleared also C. neoformans from their organs more effectively than did the control mice. C. neoformans infection in congenitally athymic (nude) mice and phenotypically normal BALB/c mice was used to determine whether T lymphocyte deficient mice may restrict proliferation of C. neoformans compared with normal mice. Interestingly, the nude mice had fewer numbers of crytococci in the organs than did the BALB/c mice. These results strongly suggest that IL-2, IFN-.gamma., poly (A) .cntdot. poly (U) and estradiol inhibit the growth of C. neoformans in vitro and in vivo, and patients receiving above agents may be protected from infections with C. neoformans.

There was no significant difference between sections from the same small piece, but when the sections originated from different parts of the tonsil significant differences were obtained in some cases. A constant ratio between "fluorescence titer" and virus titer could not be established. The role of the tonsils and small intestinal wall as portal of entry of infection in dogs was studied. Virus multiplied in epithelial cells of these loci. In addition viral antigen was present in cells of phagocytic nature, in endothelial and in lymphoid cells. The occurrence of HCC antigen in cells on the surface of the liver and spleen as well as in the peritoneal exudate in guinea pigs inoculated with HCC virus was shown. A rapid method of diagnosing HCC is described. In spontaneously or experimentally infected dogs cell material was scraped from the tonsillar surface. After staining with a fluorescent anti-HCC serum the occurrence of viral antigen could be shown in cells in the collected specimens. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19654600016766

In order to establish the effects of CD80/CD86 on Th17 cell differentiation in acute viral myocarditis (VMC), we infected C57BL/6 mice with Coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) and examined the effects of the treatment with anti-CD80/CD86 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on Th17 cell differentiation in vivo. The effects of anti-CD80/CD86 mAbs on Th17 cell differentiation were further evaluated in vitro. The treatment with anti-CD80 mAb induced marked suppression of Th17 cell differentiation and ROR-gamma t mRNA expression, whereas anti-CD86 mAb alone had no effect, both in vivo and in vitro. Our finding that CD80 regulates Th17 differentiation supports the potential utility of anti-CD80 mAb as an effective new immunotherapeutic target in acute VMC.

After infecting mice with sublethal doses of one of the infectious agents, or both together as a mixed infection, animals were subsequently exsanguated and the lungs washed by bronchoalveolar lavage. Clincial symptoms were recorded daily, examination of lung lavage fluid and sera as well as histology of the lungs were done. An increase in mortality, weight reduction and total cell yield of lung lavage fluid was observed after mixed infection. Compared to mixed infections total protein content and elastase in sera and lung lavage fluid after singular ones were raised not as much. In lung lavage fluid the total cell yield was increased more marked. These alterations indicate a synergistic effect of viruses and bacteria, developed by mixed infection as well as a bacterial infection on top of a viral one. Histopathologically the lung alterations were found to depend on the infectious agent and the mode of infection.																					BCI:BCI199089049730

J	TRAUB, ERICH								Studies on the mechanism of immunity in murine LCM								ARCH GESAMTE VIRUSFORSCH				14	(1)			65	86						1963	1963	The immunity following experimental infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus in mature (non-tolerant) mice is complicated by the apparent presence of two immunity mechanisms, one directed against the virus and the other (pathological auto-antibody ?) correlated with the pathogenesis of the disease. The experiments reported mainly concern the antiviral mechanism. Special attention has been paid to the events occurring in the lymphatic system. Neutralizing antibodies, which are either undemonstrable or present in very small amounts in mice immunized by subcutaneous infection, cannot account for the degree of active immunity shown by such animals. There is a definite correlation between the duration of active immunity and the persistence of infectious virus. Moreover, homologous interference can be readily demonstrated in cultures of infected lymph node cells. It is therefore very likely that the interference phenomenon, which appears to be the only immunity factor in congenitally infected (tolerant) mice, plays a part in the immunity of non-tolerant mice also. In them, the interfering principle is probably located in, or produced by, cells which are injured by a still hypothetical (but very probable) immunological reaction during the exudative phase of the disease. Such cells are changed morphologically and unable to grow, but still capable of producing virus for extended periods of time in tissue cultures. This may be so in vivo as well. A speculation explanation, partly based on experimental evidence, is given for the failure to demonstrate true cellular immunity in virus-free LCM-immune mice. In the clearance mechanism present in such mice but lacking in tolerant animals, the cells play a certain part. However, they are usually unable to eliminate the virus completely by themselves. It is likely that specific antibodies are an auxiliary clearing factor in vivo. Since specific complement-fixing antibodies can be detected much more easily and regularly than neutralizing antibodies in non-tolerant immune mice, the question is raised whether or not they may play a role in the clearance mechanism. A review of the literature on immunity in murine LCM is given. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19654600012174	14093844

Histopathological changes in the lungs of mice infected with mouse-adapted and unadapted variants of a-prime influenza virus								VOPROSY VIRUSOL [TRANSL]				3	(5/6)			305	311						1958	1958	Morbid anatomical changes in the lungs of mice infected with a strain of A-prime influenza virus which possessed a high pathogenicity for mice were essentially similar to the changes described in mice infected with type A and B influenza virus. A variant of A-prime influenza virus which was not adapted to mice, when multiplying in the lung of mice, caused an apparently symptom-free infection. Histological examination revealed morbid anatomical changes in the lung tissue, consisting of benign, circumscribed, reactive proliferative processes in the epithelial layer of the bronchi and those parts of the lung parenchyma adjacent to the large bronchi. The severity of the tissue lesions in experimental infection with influenza caused by the multiplication of the virus depends on the virulence of the virus particles for the animal species in question rather than on the quantitative accumulation of the virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. concl																					BCI:BCI19603500027347

The inoculation of such cells to 1-8-month-old hamsters sub cutaneously, intraperitoneally, intrapleurally, and intracerebrally resulted in the development of tumors in the site of inoculation in 68 to 75 inoculated animals. Six alternate transfers of tumor cells have been carried out according to the scheme: hamster[long dash]tissue culture[long dash]hamster. Virological investigations of materials from primary and cultivated hamster tumors revealed, as a rule, the presence of SV40 virus which caused typical vacuolation of green monkey kidney cells and could be neutralized by specific immune sera.

Infectious WNV could be recovered by direct culture of their urine and by cocultivation of kidney tissue for up to 247 days after initial infection. Only moderate histopathologic changes were observed in the kidneys or brain of the chronically infected hamsters, although WNV antigen was readily detected by immunohistochemistry within epithelium, interstitial cells, and macrophages in the distal renal tubules. Comparison of WNV isolates from serial urine samples from individual hamsters over several months indicated that the virus underwent both genetic and phenotypic changes during persistent infection. These findings are similar to previous reports of persistent infection with tickborne encephalitis and Modoc viruses.

Cell-specific IRF-3 responses protect against West Nile virus infection by interferon-dependent and -independent mechanisms								PLOS PATHOGENS				3	7			1005	1015	e106	10.1371/journal.ppat.0030106				JUL 2007	2007	Interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 is a master transcription factor that activates host antiviral defense programs. Although cell culture studies suggest that IRF-3 promotes antiviral control by inducing interferon (IFN)-beta, near normal levels of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta were observed in IRF-3(-/-) mice after infection by several RNA and DNA viruses. Thus, the specific mechanisms by which IRF-3 modulates viral infection remain controversial. Some of this disparity could reflect direct IRF-3-dependent antiviral responses in specific cell types to control infection. To address this and determine how IRF-3 coordinates an antiviral response, we infected IRF-3(-/-) mice and two primary cells relevant for West Nile virus (WNV) pathogenesis, macrophages and cortical neurons. IRF-3(-/-) mice were uniformly vulnerable to infection and developed elevated WNV burdens in peripheral and central nervous system tissues, though peripheral IFN responses were largely normal. Whereas wild-type macrophages basally expressed key host defense molecules, including RIG-I, MDA5, ISG54, and ISG56, and restricted WNV infection, IRF-3(-/-) macrophages lacked basal expression of these host defense genes and supported increased WNV infection and IFN-alpha and IFN-beta production. In contrast, wild-type cortical neurons were highly permissive to WNV and did not basally express RIG-I, MDA5, ISG54, and ISG56. IRF-3(-/-) neurons lacked induction of host defense genes and had blunted IFN-alpha and IFN-beta production, yet exhibited only modestly increased viral titers. Collectively, our data suggest that cell-specific IRF-3 responses protect against WNV infection through both IFN-dependent and -independent programs.

Olivier and Odlaug) is the 2d sp. in the genus Alaria for which the life history has been traced. The adult is not known outside the laboratory. The mesocercarial stage is abundant in the throat and leg muscles of Rana pipiens collected in Vermont. The cercariae were obtained from both naturally infected Planorbula armigera in the Douglas Lake region, Michigan, and from experimentally infected; laboratory-raised Helisoma trivolvis. The metacercaria is a typical strigeid larva of the diplostome type. There are 21 epidermal plates in 4 rows covering the body of the miracidium. 2 generations of sporocysts occur in the snail host. The hosts involved in the cycle are: P. armigera or H. trivolvis for the miracidium, 2 generations of sporocysts, and the cercaria; R. pipiens for the mesocer-caria; rats and mice for the metacercaria; dogs and cats for the adult. Eggs usually hatched in 16 days; the longest time required for hatching was 27 days. The mesocercariae, when placed directly into the thoracic cavity of a mouse, metamorphose into the metacercarial stage. This eliminates the necessity of the mesocercariae being eaten by the mouse in order to reach the intercostal muscles of the mouse. Mesocercariae of A. intermedia found in the kidneys of Vermont frogs were associated with tumors in the same organs. The flukes may carry in, or open the way for, a virus which is probably the primary cause of the tumors (Lucke). || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T. O. Odlaug																					BCI:BCI19411500006764

Not all the larvae of "infectious" generations transmit infection by biting; the amount of virus transmitted by larvae is insignificant. The nymphs and females are able to transmit far larger amounts of virus than larvae. Infected ticks excrete the virus in their feoes while feeding in all developmental stages, and such ticks when fed on immune animals excrete less virus. In female ticks fed on immunized animals virus in excreta could not be demonstrated. In immune hosts challenge from infected ticks caused an increase in antibody titer, but not disease . || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: MDS																					BCI:BCI19603500038847

Baboon model for West Nile Virus infection and vaccine evaluation								VIROLOGY				355	1			44	51		10.1016/j.virol.2006.06.033				NOV 10 2006	2006	Animal models that closely mimic the human condition are of paramount significance to study pathogenic mechanisms, vaccine and therapy scenarios. This is particularly true for investigations that involve emerging infectious diseases. Nonhuman primate species represent an alternative to the more intensively investigated rodent animal models and in a number of instances have been shown to represent a more reliable predictor of the human response to infection. West Nile virus (WNV) has emerged as a new pathogen in the Americas. It has a 5% fatality rate, predominantly in the elderly and immune compromised. Typically, infections are cleared by neutralizing antibodies, which suggests that a vaccine would be efficacious. Previously, only macaques had been evaluated as a primate model for WNV vaccine design. The macaques did not develop WNV disease nor express the full complement of IgG subclasses that is found in humans. We therefore explored baboons, which exhibit the similar four IgG subclasses observed in humans as a new model for WNV infection and vaccine evaluation. In this present report, we describe the experimental infection of baboons with WNV and test the efficacy of an inactivated WNV vaccination strategy. All experimentally infected animals developed transient viremia and subsequent neutralizing antibodies. Anti-WNV IgM antibodies peaked at 20 days post-infection. Anti-WNV IgG antibodies appeared later and persisted past 60 days. Prior vaccination with chemically inactivated virus induced neutralizing titers and a fast, high titer IgG recall response, which resulted in lower viremia upon challenge. This report is the first to describe the development of the baboon model for WNV experimental infection and the utility of this model to characterize the immunologic response against WNV and a candidate WNV vaccine.

SQ 34,514 was orally efficacious in a herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) systemic infection, an intracerebral HSV-2 infection, a vaginally induced HSV-2 infection in ovariectomized mice, and in a systemic murine cytomegalovirus infection. SQ 34,514 compared favorably with acyclovir and ganciclovir in the treatment of these experimental infections. In mice, SQ 34,514 had an oral bioavailability of 80 % based on urinary excretion. SQ 34,514 may have potential value in the therapy of HSV and cytomegalovirus infections in humans.																					WOS:A1991FV09800036	1656863

The impact of the various barrier functions on successful viral invasion is not known. On ex vivo infection of murine skin, we observed efficient invasion only via the basal epidermal layer when the dermis was removed. Here, we investigated how wounding and intercellular junction formation control successful viral entry. After wounding of skin samples or removal of the stratum corneum, infected cells were rarely detected. On the basis of infection studies in epidermis from IFN-stimulated mice, we assume that mechanical wounding does not lead to an antiviral state that impedes infection. When we infected human skin equivalents, we observed entry only into unstratified keratinocytes or after wounding of fully stratified cultures. Reduced infection of keratinocytes after calcium-induced stratification confirmed the impact of junction formation. To assess the effect of functional tight junctions, stratified cultures of polarity regulator partitioning-defective-3-or E-cadherin-deficient keratinocytes were infected. As the number of infected cells strongly increased with enhanced paracellular permeability, we conclude that the formation of functional tight junctions interferes with viral entry indicating that next to the stratum corneum tight junctions are a major physical barrier for herpes simplex virus 1 invasion into tissue.

To better understand the extent of transmission of avian influenza viruses (AIV) to humans in Asia, we conducted a cross-sectional virologic study in live bird markets (LBM) in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October 2001. Specimens from 189 birds and 18 environmental samples were collected at 10 LBM. Four influenza A viruses of the H4N6 (n = 1), H5N2 (n = 1), and H9N3 (n = 2) subtypes were isolated from healthy ducks for an isolation frequency of over 30 % from this species. Two H5N1 viruses were isolated from healthy geese. The hemagglutinin (HA) genes of these H5N1 viruses possessed multiple basic amino acid motifs at the cleavage site, were HP for experimentally infected chickens, and were thus characterized as HP AIV. These HA genes shared high amino acid identities with genes of other H5NI viruses isolated in Asia during this period, but they were genetically distinct from those of H5N1 viruses isolated from poultry and humans in Vietnam during the early 2004 outbreaks. These viruses were not highly virulent for experimentally infected ducks, mice, or ferrets. These results establish that HP H5NI viruses with properties similar to viruses isolated in Hong Kong and mainland China circulated in Vietnam as early as 2001, suggest a common source for H5N1 viruses circulating in these Asian countries, and provide a framework to better understand the recent widespread emergence of HP H5NI viruses in Asia.

The objective was to produce a truncated VP28 envelope protein lacking the N-terminal transmembrane region. After induction, the recombinant V-P28F118 protein (rV-P28F118) was produced, purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize Swiss mice for monoclonal antibody production. Seven hybridoma clones were obtained. The monoclonal antibodies bound well to VP2S protein and could be used to detect WSSV by immunohistochemistry and haemolymph dot blot. Both methods detected WSSV in experimentally infected Penaeus monodon at 12 hr. These monoclonal antibodies can be used to develop simple, low cost immuno-based test kits for WSSV detection at high specificity and sensitivity.																					BCI:BCI200500109580

In the present study, the neuropathogenicity and neuroinvasiveness of USUV for 1-week-old suckling mice was investigated. After intraperitoneal inoculation, clinical signs like depression, disorientation, paraplegia, paralysis and coma were observed between 6 and 11 days post infection. Histologically, there was widespread neuronal apoptosis especially in the brain stem. Inflammatory infiltrates were scarce. Apoptosis was also present in white matter of cerebellum, medulla and spinal cord, and was frequently accompanied by primary demyelination. While apoptosis of neurons was clearly associated with presence of viral signals, the cause of apoptosis of white matter cells was more ambiguous. However, focal immunostaining was found in the white matter, especially in the spinal cord. As with all flaviviruses, USUV proved to be neuropathogenic for mice. In contrast to other flaviviruses, neuroinvasion occurred only in animals that were not older than 1 week at the time of inoculation. While neuronal apoptosis is a general aspect of flavivirus pathogenicity, demyelination seems to be a unique feature of USUV infection.																					WOS:000224617500010	15372281

The mortality rate was 100% following intraperitoneal inoculation 1-day-old ICR mice and this gradually decreased as the age at the time of inoculation increased (60% in 3-day-old mice and no deaths occurred in mice older than 6 days of age). A lethal dose greater than 10(8) PFU was necessary. Lethargy, failure to gain weight, rear limb tremors and paralysis were observed in the infected mice before death. EV71 was isolated from various tissues of the dead mice. Using a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique with a specific primer pair, a 332-bp product was detected in the tissues that produced a culture positive for EV71, Protection against EV71 challenge in neonatal mice was demonstrated following passive transfer of serum from actively immunized adult mice 1 day after inoculation with the virus. Pups from hyperimmune darns were resistant to EV71 challenge. Additionally, maternal immunization with a formalin-inactivated whole-virus vaccine prolonged the survival of pups after EV71 lethal challenge. Copyright (C) 2000 National Science Council, ROC and S.

M.								Human and Murine IFIT1 Proteins Do Not Restrict Infection of Negative-Sense RNA Viruses of the Orthomyxoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Filoviridae Families								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	18			9465	9476		10.1128/JVI.00996-15				SEP 2015	2015	Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) is a host protein with reported cell-intrinsic antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. The proposed basis for the activity against negative-sense RNA viruses is the binding to exposed 5'-triphosphates (5'-ppp) on the genome of viral RNA. However, recent studies reported relatively low binding affinities of IFIT1 for 5'-ppp RNA, suggesting that IFIT1 may not interact efficiently with this moiety under physiological conditions. To evaluate the ability of IFIT1 to have an impact on negative-sense RNA viruses, we infected Ifit1(-/-) and wild-type control mice and primary cells with four negative-sense RNA viruses (influenza A virus [IAV], La Crosse virus [LACV], Oropouche virus [OROV], and Ebola virus) corresponding to three distinct families. Unexpectedly, a lack of Ifit1 gene expression did not result in increased infection by any of these viruses in cell culture. Analogously, morbidity, mortality, and viral burdens in tissues were identical between Ifit1(-/-) and control mice after infection with IAV, LACV, or OROV. Finally, deletion of the human IFIT1 protein in A549 cells did not affect IAV replication or infection, and reciprocally, ectopic expression of IFIT1 in HEK293T cells did not inhibit IAV infection. To explain the lack of antiviral activity against IAV, we measured the binding affinity of IFIT1 for RNA oligonucleotides resembling the 5' ends of IAV gene segments. The affinity for 5'-ppp RNA was approximately 10-fold lower than that for non-2'-O-methylated (cap 0) RNA oligonucleotides. Based on this analysis, we conclude that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against negative-sense RNA viruses.IMPORTANCENegative-sense RNA viruses, including influenza virus and Ebola virus, have been responsible for some of the most deadly outbreaks in recent history. The host interferon response and induction of antiviral genes contribute to the control of infections by these viruses. IFIT1 is highly induced after virus infection and reportedly has antiviral activity against several RNA and DNA viruses. However, its role in restricting infection by negative-sense RNA viruses remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the ability of IFIT1 to inhibit negative-sense RNA virus replication and pathogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. Detailed cell culture and animal studies demonstrated that IFIT1 is not a dominant restriction factor against three different families of negative-sense RNA viruses.

JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS				68	1			1	8		10.1016/S0166-0934(97)00100-6				OCT 1997	1997	Experimental inoculation of mice provides a well characterized model for studying infection with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a flavivirus pathogenic for humans. Conflicting data on the kinetics of viremia and the development of virus titers in the brain, however, were only recently shown to have resulted from the use of assay systems with different levers of sensitivity in the titration of TBEV, i.e. plaque assay or sample transfer into naive recipient mice. Theoretically, RT-PCR could extend further the detectability to antibody-neutralized virus and when undertaken strand-specifically discriminate active replication from the mere presence of TBEV. We have compared the conventional methods for detection of TBEV with a newly devised RT-PCR method. As expected, RT-PCR, in contrast to the infectivity assays, detected antibody-neutralized virus. Furthermore, the mere presence or active replication of the virus could be differentiated by strand-specific RT-PCR. Plaque assay and sample transfer, in contrast, both detected only infectious virus. However, whereas sample transfer provides higher sensitivity for detection of TBEV from solid organs, the plaque assay is less costly and considering animals welfare more convenient. Thus, the newly devised method may allow the resolution of unanswered questions, while both the traditional infectivity assays retain their benefits in certain situations.

We evaluated the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in parenchymal brain pathology resolution following virus-induced encephalitis from a picornavirus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). We infected the following animals with TMEV for 7 to 270 days: B6/129 TNF(-/-) mice (without TNF alpha expression), B6/129 TNFR1(-/-) mice (without TNF alpha receptor 1 expression), and B6/129 TNFR2(-/-) mice (without TNF alpha receptor 2 expression). Normal TNF alpha-expressing controls were TMEV-infected B6, 129/J, B6/129F1 and B6/129F2 mice. Whereas all strains developed inflammation and neuronal injury in the hippocampus and striatum 7 to 21 days postinfection (dpi), the control mice resolved the pathology by 45 to 90 dpi. However, parenchymal hippocampal and striatal injury persisted in B6/129 TNF(-/-) mice following infection. Treating virus-infected mice with active recombinant mouse TNF alpha resulted in less hippocampal and striatal pathology, whereas TNF alpha-neutralizing treatment worsened pathology. T1 "black holes" appeared on MRI during early infection in the hippocampus and striatum in all mice but persisted only in TNF(-/-) mice. TNFR1 mediated hippocampal pathology resolution whereas TNFR2 mediated striatal healing. These findings indicate the role of TNF alpha in resolution of sublethal hippocampal and striatal injury.																					WOS:000261395200003	18422761

More attention is needed in several areas, such as increasing virulence or pathogenicity of circulating B viruses and developing vaccines against current influenza. Since preclinical trials of anti-influenza drugs are mainly conducted in mice, we developed an appropriate infection model, using an antigenically-relevant IBV strain, for furtherance of anti-influenza drug testing and influenza vaccine protective efficacy analysis. A Victoria lineage (clade 1A) IBV was serially passaged 17 times in BALB/c mice, and adaptive amino acid substitutions were found in hemagglutinin (HA) (T214I) and neuraminidase (NA) (D432N). By electron microscopy, spherical and elliptical IBV forms were noted. Light microscopy showed that mouse-adapted IBVs caused influenza pneumonia on day 6 post inoculation. We evaluated the illness pathogenicity, viral load, and histopathological features of mouse-adapted IBVs and estimated anti-influenza drugs and vaccine efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Assessment of an investigational anti-influenza drug (oseltamivir ethoxysuccinate) and an influenza vaccine (Ultrix (R), SPBNIIVS, Saint Petersburg, Russia) showed effectiveness against the mouse-adapted influenza B virus.

Irrespective of the inoculation route (intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intravenous), the vaccine in combination with interferon or interferon inducer poly(I) X poly(C) produced a considerably higher level of protection of mice (78.5%) against fatal infection with HAE virus than each of the preparations used alone. Studies of the humoral and cellular immunity reactions showed that increased protection levels after the combined use of interferon inducer and vaccine were due to interferon production and activation of the mechanisms of cellular antiviral immunity.

The World Health Organization considers obesity a worldwide epidemic that poses a major public health threat. In humans, obesity causes or exacerbates a number of other diseases and co-morbidities. Etiology of obesity includes genetic, metabolic, social, behavioral and cultural factors. Although obesity has multiple causes, an often overlooked possibility is that of obesity due to an infection. Over the past two decades, seven pathogens are reported to cause obesity in animals. Canine distemper virus was the first reported obesity-promoting virus. Rous-associated virus-7, an avian retrovirus, causes stunted growth, obesity and hyperlipidemia in chickens. Borna disease virus was noted to cause obesity in rats. Scrapie agents were reported to induce obesity in mice. These pathogens appear to produce obesity by damaging the central nervous system. Next, three adenoviruses were reported to promote obesity, but their mechanisms are not clear. Animals experimentally infected with SMAM-1, an avian adenovirus, or two human adenoviruses, adenovirus type 36 (Ad-36) and Ad-37, developed adiposity. Notably, SMAM-1 and Ad-36 were associated with obesity in humans. Although more research is needed to further define the mechanisms and the role of pathogens in the etiology of obesity, they should be included in the long list of potential etiological factors for obesity. Determination of the role of pathogens in human obesity is critical for its successful treatment and prevention. (C) 2004 Prous Science. All rights reserved.

Specific primers for amplification of Reo-3 RNA was selected, and Reo-3 RNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green I. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 3.2×100 TCID50/ml. The real-time RT-PCR method was proven to be reproducible and very specific to Reo-3. The established real-time RT-PCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with Reo-3. Reo-3 RNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culture supernatant. When the real-time RT-PCR assay was applied to the validation of virus removal during a virus filtration process, the result was similar to that of virus infectivity assay. Therefore, it was concluded that this rapid, specific, sensitive, and robust assay could replace infectivity assay for detection and clearance validation of Reo-3.				세포배양 유래 생물의약품 생산 공정에서 다양한 바이러스가 오염된 사례가 있기 때문에 바이러스 안전성 검증이 필수적이다. Reovirus type 3 (Reo-3)는 동물 세포주와 동물 세포 배양 공정에 오염되는 대표적인 바이러스이다. 세포배양 유래 생물의약품의 Reo-3 안전성을 확보하기 위해, 세포주, 원료물질, 제조공정, 완제품에서 Reo-3를 정량적으로 검출하고, 제조공정에서 Reo-3 제거 검증을 위한 시험법으로 활용이 가능한 real-time RT-PCR 시험법을 확립하였다. Reo-3에 특이적인 primer를 선별하였으며, 형광염료 SYBR Green I을 사용하여 Reo-3 RNA정량 검출 시험법을 최적화하였다. 세포배양법에 의한 감염역가와 비교한 결과 real-time RT-PCR 민감도는 3.2×100 TCID50/ml이었다. 확립된 시험법의 신뢰성(reliability)을 보증하기 위해 시험법 검증을 실시한 결과 특이성(specificity)과 재현성(reproducibility)이 우수함을 확인하였다. 확립된 real-time RT-PCR을 생물의약품 제조공정 검증에 적용할 수 있는지 확인하기 위하여 인위적으로 Reo-3를 오염시킨 CHO 세포에서 Reo-3 검출 시험을 실시한 결과 Reo-3를 감염시킨 CHO 세포와 세포배양 상청액에서 Reo-3를 정량적으로 검출할 수 있었다. 또한 바이러스 필터 공정에서 Reo-3 제거 효과를 감염역가 시험법과 비교 검증한 결과 더 빠른 시간에 동일한 결과를 얻을수 있었다. 위와 같은 결과에서 확립된 Reo-3 real-time RT-PCR 시험법은 생물의약품 안전성 보증을 위한 세포주검증, 생물의약품 생산 공정 검증, 바이러스 제거 공정 검증 등에서 감염역가 시험법을 대신할 수 있는 신속하고,특이성과 민감성이 우수한 시험법임을 확인하였다.

Experimental Helicobacter marmotae infection in A/J mice causes enterohepatic disease								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY				59	10			1235	1241		10.1099/jmm.0.020479-0				OCT 2010	2010	Helicobacter marmotae has been identified in the inflamed livers of Eastern woodchucks (Marmota monax) infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), as well as from the livers of WHV-negative woodchucks. Because the majority of WHV-positive woodchucks with hepatic tumours were culture or PCR positive for this helicobacter, and WHV-negative woodchucks with H. marmotae had hepatitis, the bacterium may have a role in tumour promotion related to chronic inflammation In this study, the type strain of H marmotae was inoculated intraperitoneally into 48 male and female A/J mice, a strain noted to be susceptible to Helicobacter hepaticus-induced liver tumours Sixteen mice served as mock-dosed controls. At 6, 12 and 18 months post-inoculation (p.i.), there were statistically significant (P<0.05) differences in mean inflammation scores for the caecum and proximal colon between experimentally infected and control mice Differences in hepatic inflammation were significant (P<0 05) at 6 and 12 months p.i between the two groups but not at the 18 month time point. Two infected male mice had livers with severe hepatitis, and the liver samples were culture positive for H. marmotae. Serum IgG levels in the mice dosed with H. marmotae were elevated for the duration of the study. These results demonstrate that the woodchuck helicobacter can successfully colonize mice and cause enterohepatic disease In the future, a mouse-adapted strain of H marmotae could be selected to maximize colonization and lesion development. Such a woodchuck helicobacter-infected mouse model could be used to dissect potential mechanisms of microbial co-carcinogenesis involved in tumour development in woodchucks with WHV and in humans with hepatitis B virus																					WOS:000283004700016	20616187

The genetic analyses of the Egyptian H5N8 viruses isolated through active surveillance in wild birds and domestic poultry in the winter of 2016/2017 showed multiple introductions of reassortant viruses. In this study, we investigated and compared the growth kinetics, infectivity, and pathogenicity of the three reassortant forms of H5N8 viruses detected in wild birds and domestic poultry in Egypt during the first introduction wave in the winter of 2016/2017. Three representative H5N8 viruses (abbreviated as 813, 871, and 13666) were selected. The 871/H5N8 virus showed enhanced growth properties in vitro in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A549 cells. Interestingly, all viruses replicated well in mice without prior adaptation. Infected C57BL/6 mice showed 20% mortality for 813/H5N8 and 60% mortality for 871/H5N8 and 13666/H5N8, which could be attributed to the genetic differences among the viruses. Studies on the pathogenicity in experimentally infected ducks revealed a range of pathogenic effects, with mortality rate ranging from 0% for 813/H5N8 and 13666/H5N8 to 28% for 871/H5N8. No significant differences were observed among the three compared viruses in infected chickens. Overall, different H5N8 viruses had variable biological characteristics, indicating a continuous need for surveillance and virus characterization efforts.

Journal of virology				96	2			e0187921	e0187921		10.1128/JVI.01879-21				2022-01-26	2022	Although a broad range of viruses cause myocarditis, the mechanisms that underlie viral myocarditis are poorly understood. Here, we report that the M2 gene is a determinant of reovirus myocarditis. The M2 gene encodes outer capsid protein mu1, which mediates host membrane penetration during reovirus entry. We infected newborn C57BL/6 mice with reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) or a reassortant reovirus in which the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) was substituted into the T1L genetic background (T1L/T3DM2). T1L was nonlethal in wild-type mice, whereas more than 90% of mice succumbed to T1L/T3DM2 infection. T1L/T3DM2 produced higher viral loads than T1L at the site of inoculation. In secondary organs, T1L/T3DM2 was detected with more rapid kinetics and reached higher peak titers than T1L. We found that hearts from T1L/T3DM2-infected mice were grossly abnormal, with large lesions indicative of substantial inflammatory infiltrate. Lesions in T1L/T3DM2-infected mice contained necrotic cardiomyocytes with pyknotic debris, as well as extensive lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration. In contrast, T1L induced the formation of small purulent lesions in a small subset of animals, consistent with T1L being mildly myocarditic. Finally, more activated caspase-3-positive cells were observed in hearts from animals infected with T1L/T3DM2 than T1L. Together, our findings indicate that substitution of the T3D M2 allele into an otherwise T1L genetic background is sufficient to change a nonlethal infection into a lethal infection. Our results further indicate that T3D M2 enhances T1L replication and dissemination in vivo, which potentiates the capacity of reovirus to cause myocarditis. IMPORTANCE Reovirus is a nonenveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome that serves as a model for studying viral myocarditis. The mechanisms by which reovirus drives myocarditis development are not fully elucidated. We found that substituting the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) into an otherwise type 1 Lang (T1L) genetic background (T1L/T3DM2) was sufficient to convert the nonlethal T1L strain into a lethal infection in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. T1L/T3DM2 disseminated more efficiently and reached higher maximum titers than T1L in all organs tested, including the heart. T1L is mildly myocarditic and induced small areas of cardiac inflammation in a subset of mice. In contrast, hearts from mice infected with T1L/T3DM2 contained extensive cardiac inflammatory infiltration and more activated caspase-3-positive cells, which is indicative of apoptosis. Together, our findings identify the reovirus M2 gene as a new determinant of reovirus-induced myocarditis.																					MEDLINE:34757847	34757847

Viruses that comprise the first group, murine leukemia virus and foamy virus, integrate preferentially near transcription start sites. The second group, notably human immunodeficiency virus and simian immunodeficiency virus, preferentially targets transcription units. Avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), forming the third group, show little preference for any genomic feature. We have previously shown that some human cells sustain mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) infection; therefore, we infected a susceptible human breast cell line, Hs578T, and, without introducing a species-specific bias, compared the MMTV integration profile to those of other retroviruses. Additionally, we infected a mouse cell line, NMuMG, and thus we could compare MMTV integration site selection in human and mouse cells. In total, we examined 468 unique MMTV integration sites. Irrespective of whether human or mouse cells were infected, no integration bias favoring transcription start sites was detected, a profile that is reminiscent of that of ASLV and HTLV. However, in contrast to ASLV and HTLV, not even a modest tendency in favor of integration within genes was observed. Similarly, repetitive sequences and genes that are frequently tagged by MMTV in mammary tumors were not preferentially targeted in cell culture either in mouse or in human cells; hence, we conclude that MMTV displays the most random dispersion of integration sites among retroviruses determined so far.

To overcome this difficulty and develop useful models for these viruses, three main approaches have been employed: first, experimental infection of laboratory animals [mainly new-world non-human primates (NHPs)] with EBV or KSHV; second, experimental infection of NHPs (mainly old-world NHPs) with EBV- or KSHV-related gammaherpesviruses inherent to respective NHPs; and third, experimental infection of humanized mice, i.e., immunodeficient mice engrafted with functional human cells or tissues (mainly human immune system components) with EBV or KSHV. These models have recapitulated diseases caused by human gammaherpesviruses, their asymptomatic persistent infections, as well as both innate and adaptive immune responses to them, facilitating the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic measures against these viruses.

Experimental infection of Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) with Sosuga virus demonstrates potential transmission routes for a bat-borne human pathogenic paramyxovirus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				14	3					e0008092	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008092				MAR 2020	2020	In August 2012, a wildlife biologist became severely ill after becoming infected with a novel paramyxovirus, termed Sosuga virus. In the weeks prior to illness, the patient worked with multiple species of bats in South Sudan and Uganda, including Egyptian rousette bats (ERBs: Rousettus aegyptiacus). A follow-up study of Ugandan bats found multiple wild-caught ERBs to test positive for SOSV in liver and spleen. To determine the competency of these bats to act as a natural reservoir host for SOSV capable of infecting humans, captive-bred ERBs were inoculated with a recombinant SOSV, representative of the patient's virus sequence. The bats were inoculated subcutaneously, sampled daily (blood, urine, fecal, oral and rectal swabs) and serially euthanized at predetermined time points. All inoculated bats became infected with SOSV in multiple tissues and blood, urine, oral, rectal and fecal swabs tested positive for SOSV RNA. No evidence of overt morbidity or mortality were observed in infected ERBs, although histopathological examination showed subclinical disease in a subset of tissues. Importantly, SOSV was isolated from oral/rectal swabs, urine and feces, demonstrating shedding of infectious virus concomitant with systemic infection. All bats euthanized at 21 days post-inoculation (DPI) seroconverted to SOSV between 16 and 21 DPI. These results are consistent with ERBs being competent reservoir hosts for SOSV with spillover potential to humans.Author summarySosuga virus (SOSV) was first identified in August 2012 in a sample obtained from a biologist that had become severely ill after working with bats in Sudan and Uganda. Testing of bat tissues from Uganda revealed the presence of SOSV RNA in Egyptian rousette bats (ERB: Rousettus aegyptiacus). To more definitively determine if these bats could be reservoir hosts of SOSV with potential for transmitting the virus to humans, we subcutaneously inoculated 12 captive-bred ERBs with a recombinant SOSV and collected biological samples daily through 21 days post inoculation (DPI) to investigate the dynamics of virus infection and shedding. All bats became infected with SOSV and exhibited only mild cellular pathology following histopathological analyses. Multiple qRT-PCR and virus isolation positive tissues were collected as well as urine, oral, rectal, and fecal swabs, indicative of a systemic infection. At study completion, no animals had displayed any overt clinical signs of infection, virus was detected in multiple tissues, and all infected bats euthanized at the latest time point had seroconverted to SOSV. Collectively, our study demonstrates ERBs are a competent host and exhibit attributes consistent with being a natural reservoir and zoonotic source for SOSV.

Barty (ECHO 9 virus AB) resulted in diffuse polymyositis 4 days later. The disease, after a delay of 1 day, increased in intensity and was accompanied by a rapid, progressive paresis, leading to death 7-11 days following infection. As early as 24-48 h after inoculation, initial ultrastructural degenerative changes, characterized by segmental dilation of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, were detected. Disruption and breakage of myofibrils followed and led to the formation of increasing numbers of contraction bands. Ultimately, virus-mediated nuclear and other organellar injury resulted in muscle fiber necrosis. Some substructural cellular events related to virus propagation were observed. Beginning on the 4th day after infection, pronounced proliferation of the sarcoplasmic-reticulum membranes became evident in perinuclear and subsarcolemmal areas in the mature muscle fibers, myoblasts and post-fused myotubes of mice inoculated within 18 h after birth. These cytological alterations were not noted in the myoblasts and myotubes of NMRI mice injected with virus 2 or 4 days after birth.																					BCI:BCI198172053038

For the experiments the influenza virus PR8 was used. It was proved that Microtus arvalis is susceptible to the virus of influenza PR8. The susceptibility of Microtus arvalis proved not to be less that that of white mice. The virus of influenza PR8 was isolated from the lungs of all the examined white mice and Microtus arvalis. In not a single case, however, could the virus be isolated from the Gamasides, or from the Hoplopleura acanthopus, or from the Polyplax spinulosa in spite of the fact that in all the examined mice virusemia was present. This is an indication that the Gamasides, Hoplopleura acanthopus and Polyplax spinulosa could not be infected with the virus of influenza PR8 (or that the virus was destroyed after the penetration of the organism into the blood of the host). The experiments should be repeated on a larger number of animals and the virusemia of mice should be studied with suitable controls. It appears that Microtus arvalis is a suitable animal for experimental infection with the virus of influenza. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19613600041529	13732917

Upon congenital or neonatal infection, the virus can infect and replicate in the developing brain, which may induce severe neurological damage, including deafness and mental retardation. Despite the potential severity of the symptoms, the therapeutic options are limited by the unavailability of a vaccine and the absence of a specific antiviral therapy. Furthermore, a precise description of the molecular events occurring during infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is still lacking since observations mostly derive from the autopsy of infected children. Several animal models, such as rhesus macaque CMV, have been developed and provided important insights into CMV pathogenesis in the CNS. However, despite its evolutionary proximity with humans, this model was limited by the intracranial inoculation procedure used to infect the animals and consistently induce CNS infection. Furthermore, ethical considerations have promoted the development of alternative models, among which neonatal infection of newborn mice with mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) has recently led to significant advances. For instance, it was reported that intraperitoneal injection of MCMV to Balb/c neonates leads to infection of neurons and glial cells in specific areas of the brain. These findings suggested that experimental inoculation of mice might recapitulate the deficits induced by HCMV infection in children. Nevertheless, a dynamic analysis of MCMV infection of neonates is difficult to perform because classical methodology requires the sacrifice of a significant number of animals at different time points to analyze the viral burden and/or immune-related parameters. To circumvent this bottleneck and to enable future investigations of rare mutant animals, we applied in vivo imaging technology to perform a time-course analysis of the viral dissemination in the brain upon peripheral injection of a recombinant MCMV expressing luciferase to C57Bl/6 neonates.

The results indicated that the virus replicated in the heart, spleen, thymus, pancreas, small and large intestines in the acute stage of the infection. Infectious virus was present in the spleen till day 35 post infection (p.i.). Histopathology of the hearts showed mild foci of infiltration of mononuclear cells in the acute stage of infection and massive inflammation of exocrine pancreas on day 5 p.i. These results, when compared to those of our previous study (Bopegamage et al., 2003), suggest that the pathogenesis of the disease may be influenced by the route of virus administration into the host.

Identification of H2N3 influenza A viruses from swine in the United States								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA				104	52			20949	20954		10.1073/pnas.0710286104				DEC 26 2007	2007	Although viruses of each of the 16 influenza A HA subtypes are potential human pathogens, only viruses of the H1, H2, and H3 subtype are known to have been successfully established in humans. 142 influenza viruses have been absent from human circulation since 1968, and as such they pose a substantial human pandemic risk. In this report, we isolate and characterize genetically similar avian/swine virus reassortant H2N3 influenza A viruses isolated from diseased swine from two farms in the United States. These viruses contained leucine at position 226 of the 142 protein, which has been associated with increased binding affinity to the mammalian alpha 2,6Gal-linked sialic acid virus receptor. Correspondingly, the H2N3 viruses were able to cause disease in experimentally infected swine and mice without prior adaptation. In addition, the swine H2N3 virus was infectious and highly transmissible in swine and ferrets. Taken together, these findings suggest that the H2N3 virus has undergone some adaptation to the mammalian host and that their spread should be very closely monitored.

In order to interpret these data, it is necessary to know the course of antibodies and pathogen levels after infection. Such data are typically collected using experimental infection studies in which host individuals are inoculated in the laboratory and sampled over an extended period, but because laboratory conditions are controlled and much less variable than natural conditions, the immune response and pathogen dynamics may differ. Here, we compared Morogoro arenavirus infection patterns between naturally and experimentally infected multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis). Longitudinal samples were collected during three months of bi-weekly trapping in Morogoro, Tanzania, and antibody titer and viral RNA presence were determined. The time of infection was estimated from these data using a recently developed Bayesian approach, which allowed us to assess whether the natural temporal patterns match the previously observed patterns in the laboratory. A good match was found for 52% of naturally infected individuals, while most of the mismatches can be explained by the presence of chronically infected individuals (35%), maternal antibodies (10%), and an antibody detection limit (25%). These results suggest that while laboratory data are useful for interpreting field samples, there can still be differences due to conditions that were not tested in the laboratory.

Characterization of Equine Humoral Antibody Response to the Nonstructural Proteins of Equine Arteritis Virus								CLINICAL AND VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY				18	2			268	279		10.1128/CVI.00444-10				FEB 2011	2011	Equine arteritis virus (EAV) replicase consists of two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) that are encoded by open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b of the viral genome. These two replicase polyproteins are posttranslationally processed by three ORF 1a-encoded proteinases to yield at least 13 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp12, including nsp7 alpha and 7 beta). These nsps are expressed in EAV-infected cells, but the equine immune response they induce has not been studied. Therefore, the primary purpose of this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response of horses to each of the nsps following EAV infection. Individual nsp coding regions were cloned and expressed in both mammalian and bacterial expression systems. Each recombinant protein was used in an immunoprecipitation assay with equine serum samples from horses (n = 3) that were experimentally infected with three different EAV strains (VB, KY77, and KY84), from stallions (n = 4) that were persistently infected with EAV, and from horses (n = 4) that were vaccinated with the modified live-virus (MLV) vaccine strain. Subsequently, protein-antibody complexes were subjected to Western immunoblotting analysis with individual nsp-specific rabbit antisera, mouse anti-His antibody, or anti-FLAG tag antibody. Nsp2, nsp4, nsp5, and nsp12 were immunoprecipitated by most of the sera from experimentally or persistently infected horses, while sera from vaccinated horses did not react with nsp5 and reacted weakly with nsp4. However, serum samples from vaccinated horses were able to immunoprecipitate nsp2 and nsp12 proteins consistently. Information from this study will assist ongoing efforts to develop improved methods for the serologic diagnosis of EAV infection in horses.																					WOS:000286653900012	21147938

However, very few studies have evaluated the effects of IRPS on H3N2 swine influenza virus (SIV). The antiviral activities of IRPS against SIV were investigated in vitro through three different modes and in vivo in an experimental mouse model of SIV infection. Mice were treated by oral gavage with various doses of IRPS before being experimentally infected with SIV A/swine/Henan/2010(H3N2). The antiviral effects of IRPS were evaluated by clinical signs, weight, histopathology, cytokine levels in lung homogenates and serum nitric oxide (NO) and IgG levels at 2,5 and 9 d post-infection. IRPS demonstrated an inhibitory effect on SIV in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Additionally, IRPS significantly improved symptoms, reduced pathological changes and enhanced serum levels of NO and IgG in SIV-infected mice. Furthermore, detection of cytokines in lung homogenates showed IRPS could alter cytokine production to improve immune responses and systemic ability to repair inflammation. Moreover, IRPS extenuated the pulmonary inflammatory response. The results show that various concentrations of IRPS exert antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo. In an experimental mouse model of SIV infection, IRPS at a dose of 75 mg/kg was effective.																					WOS:000443668400015	29890386

Flexible-film isolators were used as a smaller scale model. In the first experiment, lasting 7 months, it was tested whether minute virus of mice (MVM) was able to penetrate the airfilters between one isolator containing experimentally infected mice and another with MVM negative mice. In the second experiment we tested whether microorganisms in the incoming air were able to penetrate air filter sets. To assess this gnotobiotic mice in an isolator were monitored for 9 months for changes of their microbial flora. In both experiments a combination of EU6 and EU9 air filters proved to be sufficient to maintain the microbiological status of the animals. The same combination of medium efficiency filters (EU6 and EU9) is used on the air supply to 4 SPF-barrier units in which infections with MVM occurred repeatedly soon after the initial stocking. After a thorough disinfection no reinfection has been detected to date. This demonstrates that the relatively low efficiency of the air filters was not the cause of the repeated infection. The procedure for disinfection is described.																					WOS:A1994PM09500008	7830375

In mice infected with a low dose of EMC-D virus, macrophages play an important role in beta-cell destruction by producing soluble mediators such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and nitric oxide ( NO). To investigate the role of NO and inducible NO synthase ( iNOS) in the development of diabetes in EMC-D virus-infected mice, we infected iNOS-deficient DBA/2 mice with EMC-D virus (2 x 10(2) PFU/mouse). Mean blood glucose levels in EMC-D virus-infected iNOS-deficient mice and wild-type mice were 205.5 and 466.7 mg/dl, respectively. Insulitis and macrophage infiltration were reduced in islets of iNOS-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice at 3 days after EMC-D virus infection. Apoptosis of beta cells was decreased in iNOS-deficient mice, as evidenced by reduced numbers of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling-positive cells. There were no differences in mRNA expression of antiapoptotic molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2 between wild-type and iNOS-deficient mice, whereas expression of proapoptotic Bax and Bak mRNAs was significantly decreased in iNOS-deficient mice. Expression of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNAs was significantly decreased in both islets and macrophages of iNOS-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice after EMC-D virus infection. Nuclear factor kappa B was less activated in macrophages of iNOS-deficient mice after virus infection. We conclude that NO plays an important role in the activation of macrophages and apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells in EMC-D virus-infected mice and that deficient iNOS gene expression inhibits macrophage activation and beta-cell apoptosis, contributing to prevention of EMC-D virus-induced diabetes.

Viral interference with antigen presentation does not alter acute or chronic CD8 T cell immunodominance in murine cytomegalovirus infection								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				178	11			7235	7241		10.4049/jimmunol.178.11.7235				JUN 1 2007	2007	Both human CMV and murine CMV (MCMV) elicit large CD8 T cell responses, despite the potent effects of viral genes that interfere with the MHC class I (MHC I) pathway of Ag presentation. To investigate the impact of immune evasion on CD8 T cell priming, we infected mice with wild-type (wt) MCMV or a mutant lacking its MHC I immune evasion genes, Am4+m6+ml52 MCMV. In acute infection, the two viruses elicited a CD8 T cell response to 26 peptide epitopes that was virtually identical in total size, kinetics, and immunodominance hierarchy. This occurred despite results demonstrating that primary DCs are susceptible to the effects of MCMV's MHC I immune evasion genes. Eight months later, responses to both wt and mutant MCMV displayed the same CD8 T cell '' memory inflation '' and altered immunodominance that characterize the transition to chronic MCMV infection in C57BL/6 mice. Taken together, these findings suggest either that cross-priming dominates over direct CD8 T cell priming in both acute and chronic MCMV infection, or else that the MHC I immune evasion genes of MCMV are unable to alter direct CD8 T cell priming in vivo. At 2 years postinfection, differences in CD8 T cell immunodominance emerged between individual mice, but on average there were only slight differences between wt and mutant virus infections. Overall, the data indicate that the presence or absence of MHC I immune evasion genes has remarkably little impact on the size or specificity of the MCMV-specific CD8 T cell response over an entire lifetime of infection.

Based on the experimental infection of MCMV, we made a survey on the natural infection of MCMV in 10 common used strains of mice. It was found that of 334 samples of submaxillary gland homogenate, none were positive for viral isolation, whereas specific anti-MCMV antibodies were found in 10.9-87.5% of different strains of mice. There were tendencies of increase in antibody positive rates as the mice grew older. A serological survey of 556 mouse sera from 40 laboratory animal institutions of some provinces showed that the antibody positive rate was as high as 61.0%, indicating that the natural infection of MCMV in laboratory mice was common in our country. The state of viral isolation negative-antibody positive suggested that the inapparent and latent infection were the main way of natural infection of MCMV.																					BCI:BCI199294121853

SARS-CoV-2 Infects Hamster Testes								MICROORGANISMS				9	6					1318	10.3390/microorganisms9061318				JUN 2021	2021	The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect millions of people worldwide. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus, there is growing concern that the disease could cause damage and pathology outside the lungs, including in the genital tract. Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection can damage the testes and reduce testosterone levels, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown and evidence of virus replication in testicular cells is lacking. We infected golden Syrian hamsters intranasally, a model for mild human COVID-19, and detected viral RNA in testes samples without histopathological changes up to one month post-infection. Using an ex vivo infection model, we detected SARS-CoV-2 replication in hamster testicular cells. Taken together, our data raise the possibility that testes damage observed in severe cases of COVID-19 could be partly explained by direct SARS-CoV-2 infection of the testicular cells.

To better understand the host-pathogen interactions and resistance to disease characteristic of many reservoir hosts, we performed experimental infections of F, progeny from Proechimys chrysaeolus collected at a Colombian enzootic VEEV focus using sympatric and allopatric virus strains. All animals became viremic with a mean peak titer of 3.3 log(10) PFU/mL, and all seroconverted with antibody titers from 1:20 to 1:640, which persisted up to 15 months. No signs of disease were observed, including after intracerebral injections. The lack of detectable disease and limited histopathologic lesions in these animals contrast dramatically with the severe disease and histopathologic findings observed in other laboratory rodents and humans, and support their role as reservoir hosts with a Iona-term coevolutionarv relationship to VEEV.

We previously replaced the coding sequences for the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and fusion (F) proteins of PIV3 with those of PIV1 in the PIV3 antigenomic cDNA. This was used to recover a fully-viable, recombinant chimeric PTV3-PIV1 virus, termed rPIV3-1, which bears the major protective antigens of PIV1 and is wild type-like with regard to growth in cell culture and in hamsters [Tao T, Durbin AP, Whitehead SS, Davoodi F, Collins FL, Murphy BR. Recovery of a fully viable chimeric human parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 in which the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion glycoprotein have been replaced by those of PIV type I. J Virol 1998;72:2955-2961]. Here we report the recovery of a derivative of rPIV3-1 carrying the three temperature-sensitive and attenuating amino acid coding changes found in the L gene of the live-attenuated cp45 PIV3 candidate vaccine virus. This virus, termed rPIV3-1.cp45L, is temperature-sensitive with a shut-off temperature of 38 degrees C, which is similar to that of the recombinant rPIV3cp45L, which possesses the same three mutations. rPIV3-1.cp45L is attenuated in the respiratory tract of hamsters to the same extent as rPIV3cp45L. Infection of hamsters with rPIV3-1.cp45L generated a moderate level of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies against wild type PIV1 and induced complete resistance to challenge with wild type PIV1. This demonstrates that this novel attenuated chimeric virus is capable of inducing a highly effective immune response against PIV1. It confirms previous observations that the surface glycoproteins of parainfluenza viruses are sufficient to induce a high level of resistance to homologous virus challenge. Unexpectedly, infection with recombinant chimeric virus rPIV3-1.cp45L or rPIV3-1, each bearing the surface glycoprotein genes of PIV1 and the internal genes of PIV3, also induced a moderate lever of resistance to replication of wild type PIV3 challenge virus. This indicates that the internal genes of PIV3 can independently induce protective immunity against PIV3 in rodents, albeit a lower level of resistance than that induced by the surface glycoproteins. Thus, a reverse genetics system for PIV3 has been used successfully to produce a live attenuated PIV1 vaccine candidate that is attenuated and protective in experimental infection in hamsters.

Although presence of virus in the human brain has not yet been reported in deceased patients, these avian influenza subtypes have the propensity to invade the brain along cranial nerves to target brainstem and diencephalic nuclei following intranasal instillation in mice and ferrets. The associations between influenza and psychiatric disturbances in past epidemics are here commented upon, and the potentials of influenza to cause nervous system dysfunction in experimental infections with a mouse-neuroadapted WSN/33 strain of the virus are reviewed. This virus strain is closely related to the Spanish flu virus, which is characterized as a uniquely high-virulence strain of the H1N1 subtype.

J	Kalina, Warren V.; Warfield, Kelly L.; Olinger, Gene G.; Bavari, Sina								Discovery of common marburgvirus protective epitopes in a BALB/c mouse model								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				6						132	10.1186/1743-422X-6-132				AUG 27 2009	2009	Background: Marburg virus (MARV) causes acute hemorrhagic fever that is often lethal, and no licensed vaccines are available for preventing this deadly viral infection. The immune mechanisms for protection against MARV are poorly understood, but previous studies suggest that both antibodies and T cells are required. In our study, we infected BALB/c mice with plaque-purified, nonlethal MARV and used overlapping peptides to map H2(d)-restricted CD8+ T-cell epitopes.Methods: Splenocytes from mice infected with nonlethal MARV were harvested and stimulated with multiple overlapping 15-mer peptide pools, and reactive CD8+ T cells were evaluated for antigen specificity by measuring upregulation of CD44 and interferon-gamma expression. After confirming positive reactivity to specific 15-mer peptides, we used extrapolated 9-mer epitopes to evaluate the induction of cytotoxic T-cell responses and protection from lethal MARV challenge in BALB/c mice.Results: We discovered a CD8+ T-cell epitope within both the MARV glycoprotein (GP) and nucleoprotein (NP) that triggered cytotoxic T-cell responses. These responses were also protective when epitope-specific splenocytes were transferred into naive animals.Conclusion: Epitope mapping of MARV GP, NP, and VP40 provides the first evidence that specific MARV-epitope induction of cellular immune responses is sufficient to combat infection. Establishment of CD8+ T-cell epitopes that are reactive to MARV proteins provides an important research tool for dissecting the significance of cellular immune responses in BALB/c mice infected with MARV.

J	Nair, Sharmila; Poddar, Subhajit; Shimak, Raeann M.; Diamond, Michael S.								Interferon Regulatory Factor 1 Protects against Chikungunya Virus-Induced Immunopathology by Restricting Infection in Muscle Cells								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				91	22					e01419-17	10.1128/JVI.01419-17				NOV 2017	2017	The innate immune system protects cells against viral pathogens in part through the autocrine and paracrine actions of alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) (type I), IFN-gamma (type II), and IFN-lambda (type III). The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) has a demonstrated role in shaping innate and adaptive antiviral immunity by inducing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and mediating signals downstream of IFN-gamma. Although ectopic expression experiments have suggested an inhibitory function of IRF-1 against infection of alphaviruses in cell culture, its role in vivo remains unknown. Here, we infected Irf1(-/-) mice with two distantly related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Ross River virus (RRV), and assessed the early antiviral functions of IRF-1 prior to induction of adaptive B and T cell responses. IRF-1 expression limited CHIKV-induced foot swelling in joint-associated tissues and prevented dissemination of CHIKV and RRV at early time points. Virological and histological analyses revealed greater infection of muscle tissues in Irf1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 appeared to be independent of the induction of type I IFN or the effects of type II and III IFNs but were associated with altered local proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses and differential infiltration of myeloid cell subsets. Collectively, our in vivo experiments suggest that IRF-1 restricts CHIKV and RRV infection in stromal cells, especially muscle cells, and that this controls local inflammation and joint-associated swelling.IMPORTANCE Interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of a broad range of antiviral host defense genes. In this study, using Irf1(-/-) mice, we investigated the role of IRF-1 in modulating pathogenesis of two related arthritogenic alphaviruses, chikungunya virus and Ross River virus. Our studies show that IRF-1 controlled alphavirus replication and swelling in jointassociated tissues within days of infection. Detailed histopathological and virological analyses revealed that IRF-1 preferentially restricted CHIKV infection in cells of non-hematopoietic lineage, including muscle cells. The antiviral actions of IRF-1 resulted in decreased local inflammatory responses in joint-associated tissues, which prevented immunopathology.																					WOS:000414005400033	28835505

Therefore, we evaluated the use of Culex quinquefasciatus Say and Aedes albopictus Skuse mosquitoes as "biological syringes'' to draw blood for virus titer determinations in small vertebrates. Groups of chicks (Gallus gallus), hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus), and house sparrows (Passer domesticus) were experimentally infected with West Nile virus (WNV) or Highlands J virus (HJV). In general, good correlation was seen between mosquito-and syringe-derived blood samples at titers >= 5.0 log(10) pfu/mL serum as compared with titers < 5.0 log(10) pfu/mL serum for chicks, hamsters, and sparrows. Ninety-two percent (24/26) of sparrows with virus titers > 10(5) pfu/mL serum had mosquito-and syringe-derived titers within one log of each other. Sparrow viremia profiles generated from single mosquito blood meals and syringe were not significantly different (p > 0.05). This technique is valuable for assessing the roles of small vertebrates in the ecologies of arboviruses, and could be used in applications beyond virology and infectious diseases, when < 10 mu L of whole blood is required.

J	Tsunoda, I; Kuang, LQ; Libbey, JE; Fujinami, RS								Axonal injury heralds virus-induced demyelination								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY				162	4			1259	1269		10.1016/S0002-9440(10)63922-3				APR 2003	2003	Axonal pathology has been highlighted as a cause of neurological disability in multiple sclerosis. The Daniels (DA) strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infects the gray matter of the central nervous system of mice during the acute phase and persistently infects the white matter of the spinal cord during the chronic phase, leading to demyelination. This experimental infection has been used as an animal model for multiple sclerosis. The GDVII strain causes an acute fatal polioencephalomyelitis without demyelination. Injured axons were detected in normal appearing white matter at 1 week after infection with DA virus by immunohistochemistry using antibodies specific for neurofilament protein. The number of damaged axons increased throughout time. By 2 and 3 weeks after infection, injured axons were accompanied by parenchymal infiltration of Ricinus communis agglutinin I+ microglia/macrophages, but never associated with perivascular T-cell infiltration or obvious demyelination until the chronic phase. GDVII virus infection resulted in. severe axonal injury in normal appearing white matter at 1 week after infection, without the presence of macrophages, T cells, or viral antigen-positive cells. The distribution of axonal injury observed during the early phase corresponded to regions where subsequent demyelination occurs during the chronic phase. The results suggest that axonal injury might herald or trigger demyelination.																					WOS:000181748300024	12651618	
J	Miller, AH; Spencer, RL; Pearce, BD; Pisell, TL; Tanapat, P; Leung, JJ; Dhabhar, FS; McEwen, BS; Biron, CA								Effects of viral infection on corticosterone secretion and glucocorticoid receptor binding in immune tissues								PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY				22	6			455	474		10.1016/S0306-4530(97)00028-0				AUG 1997	1997	During an immune challenge it has been suggested (hat responding cells secrete cytokines which then stimulate the release of glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids, in turn, are believed to bind to their receptors in target immune tissues and provide feedback inhibition on evolving immune responses. The foundations for this hypothesis have been drawn primarily from studies on animal models of autoimmune and/or inflammatory processes, and the relevance of these glucocorticoid-immune interactions to viral infections has not been extensively examined. Accordingly, we infected mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and measured plasma corticosterone and cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding at multiple time points throughout the day and throughout infection (days 3, 5, 7 and 10 post infection). Despite a vigorous immune response to this virus, LCMV infection was associated with minimal and transient increases in corticosterone secretion. Interestingly, however, significant decreases in cytosolic GR were found in immune tissues. Receptor decreases were characterized by a significant decrease in GR binding during the diurnal rise in corticosterone in the spleen and thymus of infected but not uninfected animals on days 5-10 post infection. In addition, in the morning on these days, GR binding in the spleen of infected mice was decreased compared to uninfected control mice. Following an acute injection of corticosterone on day 7 post infection, LCMV-infected animals exhibited a significantly greater decrease in splenic GR binding than uninfected control mice, suggesting an increased sensitivity to corticosterone in infected animals. No changes were found in the affinity (K-d) Of the GR during infection, nor was there evidence of an infection-associated decrease in plasma corticosteroid binding globulin. The appearance of significant GR changes in the spleen and thymus, in the absence of significant elevations in corticosterone or decreases in its binding protein, suggests that cytokines and/or other. factors produced within the immune tissues during infection either directly influenced GR number and/or function or influenced the local availability of corticosterone. Taken together, the results indicate that interactions between the neuroendocrine and immune systems can be modified at the level of the GR in the context of an ongoing immune response such as during a viral infection.

A total of sixty Kunming female mice were infected with PCV2 at a dose of 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infection dose) by intraperitoneal injection after 2 weeks of dietary L-glutamine supplementation or L-alanine supplementation (as the control (isonitrogenous) group). The measured variables on 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th d post-infection (dpi) included: (1) PCV2 virus loaded in the liver, spleen, heart, lung, kidney, ovary and serum was determined by real-time PCR; (2) IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-gamma and C-reactive protein levels in serum were measured by ELISA; (3) serum total superoxide dismutase activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 550nm absorbance. Dietary L-glutamine supplementation significantly increased serum IL-2 levels on the 3rd (P<0.01), 5th (P<0.01), 7th (P<0.05) and 9th dpi, significantly (P<0.05) increased serum IL-6 levels on 3rd dpi, significantly (P<0.05) increased serum IFN-gamma levels on the 9th and 11th dpi and significantly decreased (P<0.01) serum IL-10 levels on the 9th and 11th dpi, compared with those in the control group. Meanwhile, the PCV2 virus genome was detected sporadically throughout the experimental period in both groups. Taken together, the present results suggest that dietary L-glutamine supplementation enhances immune function in PCV2-infected mice.																					WOS:000323848700009	23351361

In experimental infection of mice, coxsackievi ruses have shown to have a strong affinity for the exocrine tissue, while even in lethal cases, the islets remain unaffected. The virus strain most intensively studied in this respect is the diabetogenic variant E2 of coxsackievirus B4. In addition, it is known that all six serotypes of coxsackie B viruses can be made diabetogenic by repeated passages in either mouse pancreas in vivo or in cultured mouse beta-cells in vitro. However, the genetic determinants of the phenomenon have not been determined. In the present study, a laboratory strain of coxsackievirus B5 was passaged repeatedly in mouse pancreas in vivo. After 15 passages, the virus phenotype was clearly changed and infection of the variant resulted in a diabetes-like syndrome in mice characterized by chronic pancreatic inflammation together with dysregulation in glucose metabolism, loss of pancreatic acinar tissue, and mild insulitis. In order to characterize the genetic determinants involved in mouse pancreas adaptation, the passaged virus variant together with the parental virus strain was cloned for molecular characterization. The whole genome sequencing of both virus strains revealed only limited differences. Altogether, eight nucleotides were changed resulting in five amino acid substitutions, of which three were located in the capsid proteins.																					WOS:000227506600011	15714484

In our study, novel subunit vaccines on the basis of an amino-terminal domain of SBV Gc of 234 amino acids ("Gc Amino") first were tested and selected using a lethal small animal challenge model and then the best performing formulations also were tested in cattle. We could show that neither E. coli expressed nor the reduced form of "Gc Amino" protected from SBV infection. In contrast, both, immunization with "Gc Amino"-encoding DNA plasmids and "Gc-amino" expressed in a mammalian system, conferred protection in up to 66% of the animals. Interestingly, the best performance was achieved with a multivalent antigen containing the covalently linked Gc domains of both, SBV and the related Akabane virus. All vaccinated cattle and mice were fully protected against SBV challenge infection. Furthermore, in the absence of antibodies against the viral N-protein, differentiation between vaccinated and field-infected animals allows an SBV marker vaccination concept. Moreover, the presented vaccine design also could be tested for other members of the Simbu serogroup and might allow the inclusion of additional immunogenic domains.

However, it is less clear as to how IL-33 regulates innate immunity. In this study, we infected wild-type (WT) and IL-33(-/-) mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and demonstrated an essential role of infection-induced IL-33 expression for robust innate IFN-gamma production in the liver. We first show that IL-33 deficiency resulted in a marked reduction in the number of IFN-gamma(+) gamma delta T and NK cells, but an increase in that of IL-17+ gamma delta T cells at 16 h postinfection. Recombinant IL-33 (rIL-33) treatment could reverse such deficiency via increasing IFN-gamma-producing gamma delta T and NK cells, and inhibiting IL-17+ gamma delta T cells. We also found that rIL-33-induced type 2 innate lymphoid cells were not involved in T-cell responses and liver injury, since the adoptive transfer of type 2 innate lymphoid cells neither affected the IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production in T cells, nor liver transferase levels in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus infected mice. Interestingly, we found that while IL-33 was not required for costimulatory molecule expression, it was critical for DC proliferation and cytokine production. Together, this study highlights an essential role of IL-33 in regulating innate IFN-gamma-production and DC function during viral hepatitis.																					WOS:000366401000012	26249267

Suzuki, Jpn. J. Exp. Med. 45:473-478, 1975). However, the resistance caused by Fv-4 is recessive in nude mice, which suggests that immunological effects play important roles in this resistance in vivo (K. Higo, Y. Kubo, Y. Iwatani, T. One, M. Maeda, a Hiai, T. Masuda, K. Kuribayashi, F. Zhang, T. Lamin, A. Adachi, and A. Ishimoto, J. Virol. 71:750-754, 1997). To determine the immunological effect on the resistance in vivo, we infected immunologically immature newborn mice homozygous (Fv-4(r/r)) and heterozygous (Fv-4(r/-)) for Fv-4. Although the Fv-4(r/r) mice showed complete resistance to F-MuLV whether infected neonatally or as adolescents, the Fv-4(r/-) mice showed high sensitivity to viral proliferation and disease induction when infected as newborns but complete resistance when infected as adolescent mice. To confirm the immunological effect on the resistance in adolescent mice with the Fv-4(r/r) and Fv-4(r/-) genotypes, we examined the effect of an immunosuppressant drug, FK506, on the resistance. The mice with the Fv-4(r/r) genotype treated with FK506 still showed resistance, but the mice with the Fv-4(r/-) genotype became highly sensitive to F-MuLV infection. Flow cytometric analysis to detect the Fv-4 gene product showed that the Fv-4 gene product was expressed on the cells from newborn and adolescent mice. The Fv-4 gene product was also detected on the cells from the FK506-treated mice as well as on those from untreated mice. However, a quantitative difference in the gene product between the cells with the FV-4(r/r) and Fv-4(r/-) genotypes was detected by indirect staining for how cytometry. These results show that the resistance to F-MuLV infection conferred by the Fv-4 gene is originally recessive, but it looks dominant in adolescent mice mainly because of the effect of the immune system.

DB exposure may have been favored by publications suggesting that rodent pathogenic viruses and bacteria are readily transmitted by DB. DB transmission has been studied with a limited number of relatively resistant microorganisms only. In most studies sentinels were exposed to DB from animals that were recently experimentally infected with high infectious doses, so positive results may have been due to overexposure to the infectious agent. The efficacy of the DB approach in the monitoring of naturally infected rodents remains to be established. We discuss some requirements of studies that might explore the real contribution of DB transmision of rodent infectios agents.																					BCI:BCI200500185469

How these autoimmune responses arise in MS is unclear, but they could result from virus infections. Thus, viral and autoimmune diseases in animals have been used to investigate the possible pathogenic mechanisms operating in MS. The autoimmune model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, is the most widely-used animal model and has greatly influenced therapeutic approaches targeting autoimmune responses. To investigate demyelination and remyelination in the absence of the adaptive immune response, toxin-induced demyelination models are used. These include using cuprizone, ethidium bromide and lysolecithin to induce myelin damage, which rapidly lead to remyelination when the toxins are withdrawn. The virus models include natural and experimental infections such as canine distemper, visna infection of sheep, and infection of non-human primates. The most commonly used viral models in rodents are Semliki Forest virus and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. The viral and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models have been instrumental in the understanding of how viruses trigger inflammation, demyelination and neurodegeneration in the central nervous system. However, due to complexity of the animal models, pathological mechanisms are also examined in central nervous system cell culture systems including co-cultures, aggregate cultures and brain slice cultures.Here we critically review in vitro and in vivo models used to investigate MS. Since knowledge gained from these models forms the basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches for MS, we address the applicability of the models. Finally, we provide guidance for using and reporting animal studies with the aim of improving translational studies to the clinic.																					WOS:000306519200009	22583443

J	GRESSENS, P; MARTIN, JR								HSV-2 DNA PERSISTENCE IN ASTROCYTES OF THE TRIGEMINAL ROOT ENTRY ZONE - DOUBLE-LABELING BY IN-SITU PCR AND IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY								JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY				53	2			127	135		10.1097/00005072-199403000-00003				MAR 1994	1994	A previous study using an in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification method showed persistent herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) DNA sequences in brains of experimentally infected mice, particularly in cells of the pens near the trigeminal root entry zone. The present study was undertaken to identify the CNS cell type(s) that persistently harbor HSV DNA and to define the associated pathology. Tissue sections including the trigeminal root were immunoreacted to detect cellular antigens, then an HSV sequence was amplified in situ. During acute infection, the CNS portion of the trigeminal root was focally demyelinated and contained viral antigen and HSV DNA in glial cells. Following acute infection, no infectious virus or HSV antigen was detected. Demyelinated root lesions contained cells whose nuclei were similar in size to those of astrocytes and contained HSV-2 DNA by in situ PCR. With double labeling techniques, HSV DNA-containing nuclei were often associated with glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity, but not with that of neuron-specific enolase and only rarely with galactocerebroside or transferrin immunostaining. Thus, at least some of the cells containing persistent HSV DNA are astrocytes. Since HSV DNA is detected when no infectious virus can be isolated and no HSV antigen is found, we conclude that this astrocytic infection is non-productive. While in situ hybridization methods show HSV latency-associated transcript (LAT) RNA in neuronal nuclei during latent infections in trigeminal ganglia and, occasionally, in brain, we were unable to detect HSV-2 LAT RNA in astrocytes in these lesions, which suggests that persistent HSV infection of astrocytes may differ from neuronal latency. This is the first report of a persistent, non-productive HSV infection in CNS glia.																					WOS:A1994MZ51000003	8120536	
J	Fujiwara, Shigeyoshi; Nakamura, Hiroyuki								Animal Models for Gammaherpesvirus Infections: Recent Development in the Analysis of Virus-Induced Pathogenesis								PATHOGENS				9	2					116	10.3390/pathogens9020116				FEB 2020	2020	Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is involved in the pathogenesis of various lymphomas and carcinomas, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) participates in the pathogenesis of endothelial sarcoma and lymphomas. EBV and KSHV are responsible for 120,000 and 44,000 annual new cases of cancer, respectively. Despite this clinical importance, no chemotherapies or vaccines have been developed for virus-specific treatment and prevention of these viruses. Humans are the only natural host for both EBV and KSHV, and only a limited species of laboratory animals are susceptible to their experimental infection; this strict host tropism has hampered the development of their animal models and thereby impeded the study of therapeutic and prophylactic strategies. To overcome this difficulty, three main approaches have been used to develop animal models for human gammaherpesvirus infections. The first is experimental infection of laboratory animals with EBV or KSHV. New-world non-human primates (NHPs) and rabbits have been mainly used in this approach. The second is experimental infection of laboratory animals with their own inherent gammaherpesviruses. NHPs and mice have been mainly used here. The third, a recent trend, employs experimental infection of EBV or KSHV or both to immunodeficient mice reconstituted with human immune system components (humanized mice). This review will discuss how these three approaches have been used to reproduce human clinical conditions associated with gammaherpesviruses and to analyze the mechanisms of their pathogenesis.

J	Nicoll, M. P.; Efstathiou, S.								Expression of the herpes simplex virus type 1 latency-associated transcripts does not influence latency establishment of virus mutants deficient for neuronal replication								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				94				2489	2494		10.1099/vir.0.056176-0				NOV 2013	2013	Herpes simplex virus type 1 establishes latency within neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. During latency, viral gene expression is largely restricted to the latency-associated transcripts (LATs), which, whilst not essential for any aspect of latency, function to suppress lytic gene expression and enhance the survival of virus-infected neurons. The latent cell population comprises primary-order neurons infected directly from peripheral tissues and cells infected following further virus spread within the ganglion. In order to assess the role of LAT expression on latency establishment within first-order neurons, we infected ROSA26R reporter mice with Cre recombinase-expressing recombinant viruses harbouring deletion of the thymidine kinase lytic gene and/or the core LAT promoter. We found that LAT expression did not impact on latency establishment in viruses unable to replicate in neurons, and under these conditions, it was not required for the survival of neurons between 3 and 31 days post-infection.

J	Penn, D; Schneider, G; White, K; Slev, P; Potts, W								Influenza infection neutralizes the attractiveness of male odour to female mice (Mus musculus)								ETHOLOGY				104	8			685	694						AUG 1998	1998	This study aimed to determine if female house mice, Mus musculus domesticus, are able to assess a male's infection status from odour cues. We collected urine from male mice before, during, and after they were experimentally infected with influenza, a respiratory virus. Females spent more time investigating urine collected from males while they were uninfected than when they were infected. Also 70 % of females released into a large enclosure preferred to nest in boxes containing urine collected from uninfected rather than infected males. This is the first evidence that mice can discriminate virally infected individuals through chemical signals and the first evidence that infection causes odour changes in the urine. To determine if the odour of infected males is repulsive, we presented females with urine samples and neutral water blanks. Normal urine collected from uninfected males was more attractive, whereas urine collected during infection was as attractive as water. This indicates that rather than being aversive, influenza infection abolishes the attractiveness of a male's odour.. A similar effect also occurs when male mice are infected with coccidian gut parasites (Kavaliers & Colwell 1995, Proc. R. Sec. Lend. 261B, 31-35). One proximate reason for the neutralization of the attractiveness of a male's odour may be a decrease in serum androgen concentrations during infection.																					WOS:000075568300005

To study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies, the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern. Adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon / (IFN-/) receptor (IFNAR(-/-)) have been described as a model of arbovirus infections. Studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues, and in some cases, the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals. Moreover, the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance. Recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections. A tremendous advantage of the IFNAR(-/-) mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. Although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans, experimental infections of IFNAR(-/-) mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host. Therefore, IFNAR(-/-) mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and the protective efficacy of new vaccines. In this review article, the most important arboviruses that have been studied using the IFNAR(-/-) mouse model will be reviewed.																					WOS:000459132000035	30625992	
J	Tu, Veronique; Abed, Yacine; Fage, Clement; Baz, Mariana; Boivin, Guy								Impact of R152K and R368K neuraminidase catalytic substitutions on in vitro properties and virulence of recombinant A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				154				110	115		10.1016/j.antiviral.2018.04.009				JUN 2018	2018	Neuraminidase (NA) mutations conferring resistance to NA inhibitors (NAIs) are expected to occur at framework or catalytic residues of the NA enzyme. Numerous clinical and in vitro reports already described NAI-resistant A(H1N1)pdm09 variants harboring various framework NA substitutions. By contrast, variants with NA catalytic changes remain poorly documented. Herein, we investigated the effect of R152K and R368K NA catalytic mutations on the NA enzyme properties, in vitro replicative capacity and virulence of A(H1N1)pdm09 recombinant viruses. In NA inhibition assays, the R152K and R368K substitutions resulted in reduced inhibition [10- to 100-fold increases in IC50 vs the wild-type (WT)] or highly reduced inhibition (> 100-fold increases in IC50) to at least 3 approved NAIs (oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir). Such resistance phenotype correlated with a significant reduction of affinity observed for the mutants in enzyme kinetics experiments [increased Km from 20 +/- 1.77 for the WT to 200.8 +/- 10.54 and 565.2 +/- 135 mu m (P < 0.01) for the R152K and R368K mutants, respectively]. The R152K and R368K variants grew at comparable or even higher titers than the WT in both MDCK and ST6GalI-MDCK cells. In experimentally-infected C57BL/6 mice, the recombinant WT and the R152K and R368K variants induced important signs of infection (weight loss) and resulted in mortality rates of 87.5%, 37.5% and 100%, respectively. The lung viral titers were comparable between the three infected groups. While the NA mutations were stable, an N154I substitution was detected in the HA2 protein of the R152K and R368K variants after in vitro passages as well as in lungs of infected mice. Due to the multi-drug resistance phenotypes and conserved fitness, the emergence of NA catalytic mutations accompanied with potential compensatory HA changes should be carefully monitored in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses.

R	Ran, Longsi; Kelvin, David								Interferon response genes as immunopathogenic correlates of SARS coronavirus infection in mice (129/S6/SvEv)								Gene Expression Omnibus															2020-06-23	2014	To further identify and understand the molecular and immunological correlates of pathology for SARS-CoV infection, we infected 129/S6/SvEv or B129 mice with the TOR2 strain of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV was detected in the lung and nasal turbinates of infected mice peaking at 1 day post infection (DPI) in both tissues before decreasing rapidly to levels below detection at 7 DPI and 3 DPI, respectively. Pulmonary lesions in virus-infected animals included bronchiolar, peribronchiolar, and perivascular foci of mild to moderate subacute inflammation. Chronic inflammation included inflammatory macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. neutralizing antibodies appeared on 5 DPI (IgM); converting to IgG on 7 DPI. Despite the prevailing notion that SARS-CoV interferes with the induction of interferon (IFn) signaling, mice infected with SARS-CoV in vivo demonstrated significantly increased expression of innate antiviral interferon (IFn) response genes (IRGs) in the lungs during the first week of acute infection. By the end of the second week of infection, coordinated expression of MHC class I / II and antigen presentation genes occurred in correlation with declining viral titres. Collectively, the mouse data suggests that robust IFn-driven innate immune responses and a critical shift from innate to adaptive immune responses is necessary for clearance and recovery from SARS-CoV infection.Keywords: time course																					DRCI:DATA2015220007392545

Therefore, infection with the obesity-inducing BDV-ob results most likely in neuroendocrine dysregulations leading to the development of an obesity syndrome. This might be due to the restriction of viral antigen expression and inflammatory lesions to brain areas which are involved in the regulation of body weight and food intake. The BDV-induced obesity syndrome represents a model for the study of immune-mediated neuroendocrine disorders caused by viral infections of the CNS.																					WOS:000084887300004	10668894

Experimental model of human hemopoiesis in mice for investigation of lymphotropic infections								GEMATOLOGIYA I TRANSFUZIOLOGIYA				53	6			27	31						NOV-DEC 2008	2008	The aim of the study was creation of an original experimental mice model for investigation of HIV-1 infection pathogenesis. The model was created in immunodeficient mice knock-out by two genes: 1) recombinase-activating gene 2 (RAG2) and 2) cytokine receptor common C chain gene. Irradiated newborn mice were intra hepatically transplanted with human CD34(+) hemopoietic precursor cells, which led to development of functional human immune system with the basic lymphoid populations in the central and peripheral immunocompetent organs by week 12 after transplantation. Experimental inoculation by HIV-1 led to high and persistent HIV-1 viremia in the peripheral blood and lymphoid organs with HIV-1 induced depletion of human CD4(+) T-lymphocytes, which was adequate to the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection in humans. Hence, this experimental model, in which human hemopoietic cells are used, can be utilized for studies of the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection, monitoring the therapy of diseases induced by HIV-1 and other lymphotropic viruses.

Monoclonal antibody to dengue capsid protein Its application in dengue studies								MABS				1	2			157	162		10.4161/mabs.1.2.7908				MAR-APR 2009	2009	Dengue fever (DF) and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) are considered the most important arthropod-borne viral diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality. The emergency and severity of dengue (Den) infections increase the necessity of an early, quick and effective dengue laboratory diagnostic. Viral isolation is considered a gold standard for diagnosis of dengue infection using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) as a tool for determining serotype specificity. Alternatives have been used to improve sensitivity and time to dengue diagnosis. Based on the early expression of dengue C protein in the life cycle, we focused our study on the application of an anti-dengue 2 virus capsid protein mAb in dengue diagnosis. The kinetic expression of dengue-2 capsid in mosquito cells and its immuno-localization in experimentally infected suckling albin Swiss (OF-1) mice brain tissues was established. The results demonstrate the possible utility of this mAb in early dengue diagnosis versus traditional isolation. In addition, a preliminary study of an enzyme immunoassay method using 8H8 mAb for specific detection of dengue C protein antigen was performed, making possible recombinant C protein quantification. The results suggest that detection of dengue capsid protein could be useful in the diagnosis of early dengue infection.																					WOS:000271897900008	20061827

A myxovirus (SF-4) associated with shipping fever of cattle								JOUR AMER VET MED ASSOC				135	(3)			147	152						1959	1959	A myxovirus (SF-4) was isolated from nasal mucus of calves showing clinical signs of shipping fever. The suggested classification of SF-4 virus is myxovirus para-influenza 3, bovine variety. This agent produces cytopathogenic changes in bovine and porcine kidney tissue cultures. It possesses hemagglutinin for guinea pig, bovine, human "O", and chicken erythrocytes. Mild clinical signs of shipping fever were produced experimentally in susceptible calves exposed to an aerosol of second passage tissue-culture fluids containing the virus. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusions were observed in bovine kidney tissue cultures infected with SF-4 virus. No cross-neutralization reaction in tissue culture could be demonstrated between SF-4 antiserum and infectious bovine rhino-tracheitis (IBR) virus. The virus of IBR was isolated from cattle showing clinical signs indistinguishable from those associated with shipping fever. Another cytopathogenic virus, not yet classified, also has been isolated from nasal mucus of cattle showing clinical signs of shipping fever. Pasteurella was isolated from approximately 65% of the cattle in herds with shipping fever and 50% of those in herds with no apparent signs of disease. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19603500029901	13672870

Earlier work revealed the importance of the BDV-specific T-cell response and of CD8(+) effector cells in particular in the destruction of virus-infected cells. Evidence was also presented that this major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted lysis detected in vitro might play a functional role in the immunopathogenesis of Borna disease. The present study employed different vaccinia virus recombinants expressing single BDV-specific proteins to investigate the specificity of the cytolytic CD8(+)-T-cell response, revealing a major epitope on the BDV nucleoprotein p40. In contrast, no direct evidence in favor of the presence of in vivo relevant cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes on other BDV-specific proteins was found.

Data obtained showed that CBA/J mice infected with stocks of parasite maintained in mice (YIUEC) presented higher level of parasitemia and shorter survival times than those infected with a stock (YITC) which was also maintained in mice but had been previously passaged in cell culture. Mouse antibody production tests, performed with the filtered plasma of mice infected with YIUEC, indicated the presence of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) while no virus was detected when testing the plasma of YITC infected mice. Filtered plasma of YIEUC infected mice was shown to contain a factor able to enhance the level of parasitemia and to reduce the mean survival time of mice challenged with 10(5) YITC. This factor, that could be serially passaged to naive mice was shown to be a coronavirus by neutralization tests.																					MEDLINE:7569609	7569609

No apparent cytotoxicity or inhibition of RSV was observed in the tissue culture studies (both compounds had IC50 and EC(50) values greater than or equal to 1000 mu g/ml and a selective index = 1). Hox ever, significant reductions in mean pulmonary RSV titers (ranging between 0.5 and 1.9 log(10)/g of lung compared with the mean pulmonary viral titers detected in similarly inoculated, placebo-treated control animals) were seen in most of the experiments, in which experimentally infected cotton rats were exposed to continuous small-particle aerosols (reservoir concentrations greater than or equal to 20 mg/ml) containing either rhuMnSOD or rhuCuZnSOD. This protective effect was dose dependent and not observed when either rSOD compound was administered parenterally (intraperitoneally) or intranasally. No toxic effects were noted in any of the cotton rats exposed to aerosols of either rhuMn or CuZnSOD; nor was any evidence of drug-induced histopathology observed in sections of lung prepared from these animals.

A Neonatal Murine Model of MRSA Pneumonia								PLOS ONE				12	1					e0169273	10.1371/journal.pone.0169273				JAN 6 2017	2017	Pneumonia due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants particularly following lower respiratory tract viral infections such as Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). However, the mechanisms by which co-infection of infants by MRSA and RSV cause increased lung pathology are unknown. Because the infant immune system is qualitatively and quantitatively different from adults we developed a model of infant MRSA pneumonia which will allow us to investigate the effects of RSV co-infection on disease severity. We infected neonatal and adult mice with increasing doses of MRSA and demonstrate that neonatal mice have delayed kinetics in clearing the bacteria in comparison to adult mice. There were differences in recruitment of immune cells into the lung following infection. Adult mice exhibited an increase in neutrophil recruitment that coincided with reduced bacterial titers followed by an increase in macrophages. Neonatal mice, however, exhibited an early increase in neutrophils that did not persist despite continued presence of the bacteria. Unlike the adult mice, neonatal mice failed to exhibit an increase in macrophages. Neonates exhibited a decrease in phagocytosis of MRSA suggesting that the decrease in clearance was partially due to deficient phagocytosis of the bacteria. Both neonates and adults responded with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines following infection. However, in contrast to the adult mice, neonates did not express constitutive levels of the anti-microbial peptide Reg3 gamma in the lung. Infection of neonates did not stimulate expression of the co-stimulatory molecule CD86 by dendritic cells and neonates exhibited a diminished T cell response compared to adult mice. Overall, we have developed a neonatal model of MRSA pneumonia that displays a similar delay in bacterial clearance as is observed in the neonatal intensive care unit and will be useful for performing co-infection studies.

J	Gray, Kathleen S.; Forrest, J. Craig; Speck, Samuel H.								The De Novo Methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b Target the Murine Gammaherpesvirus Immediate-Early Gene 50 Promoter during Establishment of Latency								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				84	10			4946	4959		10.1128/JVI.00060-10				MAY 2010	2010	The role of epigenetic modifications in the regulation of gammaherpesvirus latency has been a subject of active study for more than 20 years. DNA methylation, associated with transcriptional silencing in mammalian genomes, has been shown to be an important mechanism in the transcriptional control of several key gammaherpesvirus genes. In particular, DNA methylation of the functionally conserved immediate-early replication and transcription activator (RTA) has been shown to regulate Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus Rta expression. Here we demonstrate that the murine gammaherpesvirus (MHV68) homolog, encoded by gene 50, is also subject to direct repression by DNA methylation, both in vitro and in vivo. We observed that the treatment of latently MHV68-infected B-cell lines with a methyltransferase inhibitor induced virus reactivation. In addition, we show that the methylation of the recently characterized distal gene 50 promoter represses activity in a murine macrophage cell line. To evaluate the role of de novo methyltransferases (DNMTs) in the establishment of these methylation marks, we infected mice in which conditional DNMT3a and DNMT3b alleles were selectively deleted in B lymphocytes. DNMT3a/DNMT3b-deficient B cells were phenotypically normal, displaying no obvious compromise in cell surface marker expression or antibody production either in naive mice or in the context of nonviral and viral immunogens. However, mice lacking functional DNMT3a and DNMT3b in B cells exhibited hallmarks of deregulated MHV68 lytic replication, including increased splenomegaly and the presence of infectious virus in the spleen at day 18 following infection. In addition, total gene 50 transcript levels were elevated in the spleens of these mice at day 18, which correlated with the hypomethylation of the distal gene 50 promoter. However, by day 42 postinfection, aberrant virus replication was resolved, and we observed wild-type frequencies of viral genome-positive splenocytes in mice lacking functional DNMT3a and DNMT3b in B lymphocytes. The latter correlated with increased CpG methylation in the distal gene 50 promoter, which was restored to levels similar to those of littermate controls harboring functional DNMT3a and DNMT3b alleles in B lymphocytes, suggesting the existence of an alternative mechanism for the de novo methylation of the MHV68 genome. Importantly, this DNMT3a/DNMT3b-independent methylation appeared to be targeted specifically to the gene 50 promoter, as we observed that the promoters for MHV68 gene 72 (v-cyclin) and M11 (v-bcl2) remained hypomethylated at day 42 postinfection. Taken together, these data provide the first evidence of the importance of DNA methylation in regulating gammaherpesvirus RTA/gene 50 transcription during virus infection in vivo and provide insight into the hierarchy of host machinery required to establish this modification.

Endosomal Toll-Like Receptors 7 and 9 Cooperate in Detection of Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	3					e01173-18	10.1128/JVI.01173-18				FEB 2019	2019	Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a small-animal model suitable for study of the human pathogens Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. Here, we have characterized the roles of the endosomal Toll-like receptor (TLR) escort protein UNC93B, endosomal TLR7, -9, and -13, and cell surface TLR2 in MHV68 detection. We found that the alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) response of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) to MHV68 was reduced in Tlr9(-/-) cells compared to levels in wild type (WT) cells but not completely lost. Tlr7(-/-) pDC responded similarly to WT. However, we found that in Unc93b(-/-) pDC, as well as in Tlr7(-/-) Tlr9(-/-) double-knockout pDC, the IFN-alpha response to MHV68 was completely abolished. Thus, the only pattern recognition receptors contributing to the IFN-alpha response to MHV68 in pDC are TLR7 and TLR9, but the contribution of TLR7 is masked by the presence of TLR9. To address the role of UNC93B and TLR for MHV68 infection in vivo, we infected mice with MHV68. Lytic replication of MHV68 after intravenous infection was enhanced in the lungs, spleen, and liver of UNC93B-deficient mice, in the spleen of TLR9-deficient mice, and in the liver and spleen of Tlr7(-/-) Tlr9(-/-) mice. The absence of TLR2 or TLR13 did not affect lytic viral titers. We then compared reactivation of MHV68 from latently infected WT, Unc93b(-/-), Tlr7(-/-), Tlr9(-/-), Tlr7(-/-), and Tlr9(-/-) splenocytes. We observed enhanced reactivation and latent viral loads, particularly from Tlr7(-/-) Tlr9(-/-) splenocytes compared to levels in the WT. Our data show that UNC93B-dependent TLR7 and TLR9 cooperate in and contribute to detection and control of MHV68 infection.IMPORTANCE The two human gammaherpesviruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), can cause aggressive forms of cancer. These herpesviruses are strictly host specific, and therefore the homolog murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is a widely used model to obtain in vivo insights into the interaction between these two gammaherpesviruses and their host. Like EBV and KSHV, MHV68 establishes lifelong latency in B cells. The innate immune system serves as one of the first lines of host defense, with pattern recognition receptors such as the Toll-like receptors playing a crucial role in mounting a potent antiviral immune response to various pathogens. Here, we shed light on a yet unanticipated role of Toll-like receptor 7 in the recognition of MHV68 in a subset of immune cells called plasmacytoid dendritic cells, as well as on the control of this virus in its host.

Baculovirus-expressed VP7 crystals were purified from infected insect cells. Analytical accuracy of the I-ELISA was examined using sera (n = 38) from an experimentally infected horse, from foals born to vaccinated mares, from guinea-pigs immunized with nine serotypes of AHSV, and from sera of animals infected with other orbiviruses. Compared to traditional serological assays, the I-ELISA was more sensitive in detection of the earliest immunological response in an infected horse and declining levels of maternal immunity in foals. Antibodies to all nine serotypes of AHSV could be detected. Cross-reactivity to related orbiviruses was not observed. Diagnostic accuracy of the I-ELISA was assessed by testing sera from vaccinated horses (n = 358) residing in AHS-enzootic areas and from unvaccinated horses (n = 48 1) residing in an AHS-free area. Sera were categorised as positive or negative for antibodies to AHSV using virus neutralisation tests. The TG-ROC analysis was used for the selection of the cut-off value. At a cut-off of 11.9 of the high positive control serum (percentage positivity), the I-ELISA specificity was 100%, sensitivity 99.4%, and the Jouden index was 0.99. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, in some cases the mechanisms through which these lymphocytes act remain partially elucidated or completely unknown. A new approach to these biological problems is the use of transcriptional analyses to find mRNAs whose abundance in tissues is altered by depletion of lymphocyte subsets. We have verified the use mRNA differential display (DD) for this purpose and applied it in a study of CD8(+) lymphocyte mediated clearance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from the nervous systems of experimentally infected mice. The results of the differential displays and characterisation of a large mRNA identified using this strategy are presented. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We infected weanling rats with Sendai virus, thus causing a mild respiratory infection. Within 7 days of infection, Sendai virus was essentially undetectable by using viral culture and immunohistochemical techniques. Animals at day 7 of Sendai virus infection were then exposed to normobaric hypoxia (fraction of inspired O-2 = 0.1) for 24 h and examined for increases in gravimetric lung water and in vascular permeability, as well as for histological evidence of increased lung water Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed on a separate series of animals. Compared with control groups, infected hypoxic animals showed significant increases in perivascular cuffing, gravimetric lung water, and lung protein leak. In addition, infected hypoxic animals had increases in lavage fluid cell counts and protein content compared with controls. We conclude that young rats, exposed to moderate hypoxia while recovering from a mild viral respiratory infection, may demonstrate evidence of early pulmonary edema formation, a finding of potential relevance to human high-altitude pulmonary edema.

Strain-Specific Properties and T Cells Regulate the Susceptibility to Papilloma Induction by Mus musculus Papillomavirus 1								PLOS PATHOGENS				10	8					e1004314	10.1371/journal.ppat.1004314				AUG 2014	2014	The immunocytes that regulate papillomavirus infection and lesion development in humans and animals remain largely undefined. We found that immunocompetent mice with varying H-2 haplotypes displayed asymptomatic skin infection that produced L1 when challenged with 6 x 10(10) MusPV1 virions, the recently identified domestic mouse papillomavirus (also designated "MmuPV1''), but were uniformly resistant to MusPV1-induced papillomatosis. Broad immunosuppression with cyclosporin A resulted in variable induction of papillomas after experimental infection with a similar dose, from robust in Cr:ORL SENCAR to none in C57BL/6 mice, with lesional outgrowth correlating with early viral gene expression and partly with reported strain-specific susceptibility to chemical carcinogens, but not with H-2 haplotype. Challenge with 1 x 10(12) virions in the absence of immunosuppression induced small transient papillomas in Cr: ORL SENCAR but not in C57BL/6 mice. Antibody-induced depletion of CD3(+) T cells permitted efficient virus replication and papilloma formation in both strains, providing experimental proof for the crucial role of T cells in controlling papillomavirus infection and associated disease. In Cr: ORL SENCAR mice, immunodepletion of either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells was sufficient for efficient infection and papillomatosis, although deletion of one subset did not inhibit the recruitment of the other subset to the infected epithelium. Thus, the functional cooperation of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells is required to protect this strain. In contrast, C57BL/6 mice required depletion of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells for infection and papillomatosis, and separate CD4 knock-out and CD8 knock-out C57BL/6 were also resistant. Thus, in C57BL/6 mice, either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell-independent mechanisms exist that can protect this particular strain from MusPV1-associated disease. These findings may help to explain the diversity of pathological outcomes in immunocompetent humans after infection with a specific human papillomavirus genotype.

Mice were vaccinated with plasmids containing the herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein B (gB) or D (gD) genes under the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter control. Vaccines were injected intramuscularly (i.m.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) as purified DNA alone or as formulations supplemented with different non-ionic block copolymers. Antibody responses were assessed by immunofluorescence and radio-immunoprecipitation assays. Mice inoculated with either gB or gD plasmid, alone or with non-ionic block copolymers CRL 1029 and CRL 1190, produced high levels of antibodies specific for gB or gD. Three weeks after the last vaccination, mice were challenged with a clinical HSV-1 isolate (ABGK-1) by inoculation of a shaved and subsequently scarified area between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae. Mice immunised with either gD or gB plasmid alone or mixed with copolymers were protected against lethal HSV-1 challenge when immunisation was performed via the i.m. route. Immunisations given via the i.p. route induced humoral responses in some mice and protected the animals against lethal HSV-1 challenge only when the formulations contained copolymers. The BALB/c mouse model was shown to be as good a model as the hairless mouse model.																					WOS:000174521100012	11926742

Rabies Virus Infection Induces Type I Interferon Production in an IPS-1 Dependent Manner While Dendritic Cell Activation Relies on IFNAR Signaling								PLOS PATHOGENS				6	7					e1001016	10.1371/journal.ppat.1001016				JUL 2010	2010	As with many viruses, rabies virus (RABV) infection induces type I interferon (IFN) production within the infected host cells. However, RABV has evolved mechanisms by which to inhibit IFN production in order to sustain infection. Here we show that RABV infection of dendritic cells (DC) induces potent type I IFN production and DC activation. Although DCs are infected by RABV, the viral replication is highly suppressed in DCs, rendering the infection non-productive. We exploited this finding in bone marrow derived DCs (BMDC) in order to differentiate which pattern recognition receptor(s) (PRR) is responsible for inducing type I IFN following infection with RABV. Our results indicate that BMDC activation and type I IFN production following a RABV infection is independent of TLR signaling. However, IPS-1 is essential for both BMDC activation and IFN production. Interestingly, we see that the BMDC activation is primarily due to signaling through the IFNAR and only marginally induced by the initial infection. To further identify the receptor recognizing RABV infection, we next analyzed BMDC from Mda-5-/- and RIG-I-/- mice. In the absence of either receptor, there is a significant decrease in BMDC activation at 12h post infection. However, only RIG-I-/- cells exhibit a delay in type I IFN production. In order to determine the role that IPS-1 plays in vivo, we infected mice with pathogenic RABV. We see that IPS-1-/- mice are more susceptible to infection than IPS-1+/+ mice and have a significantly increased incident of limb paralysis.																					WOS:000280527000044	20661430

Considering the substitution of the Fuenzalida Palacios rabies vaccine by the Vero cell raised anti-rabies vaccine in almost all countries, the objective of this work was to evaluate the survival and cytokine serum concentration of rabies virus-infected mice treated with P. acnes in conjunction with or the anti-rabies-VERO vaccine. For this, Swiss mice were experimentally infected with street rabies virus and subjected to vaccine and/or P. acnes following infection. Animals were killed at different times and serum was collected to evaluate cytokines. The greatest survival was observed in animals given one or two does of P. acnes in the absence of vaccination. Animals given anti-rabies VERO vaccine alone or with three doses of P. acnes had the second highest survival rate. The group that had the highest percentage of mortality also had the highest IL-6 concentration on the 10th day, a time correlating with clinical symptoms of the animals. The results reinforce the inefficacy of anti-rabies vaccine in only one dose as a post-exposure treatment irrespective of the type of vaccine used, the immunomodulation activity of P. acnes in rabies post-exposure treatment and suggest a role for IL-6 in rabies virus pathogenesis.

A high seroprevalence of the Marseillevirus has been recorded in the general population. Whether Marseillevirus can disseminate and persist within a mammal after entry remains unproven. We aimed to assess the ability of the virus to disseminate and persist into healthy organisms, especially in the lymphoid organs. Parenteral inoculations were performed by intraperitoneal injection (in rats and mice) or intravenous injection (in rats). Airway inoculation was performed by aerosolization (in mice). Dissemination and persistence were assessed by using PCR and amebal co-culture. Serologies were performed by immunofluorescent assay. Pathological examination was conducted after standard and immunohistochemistry staining. After intraperitoneal inoculation in mice and rats, Marseillevirus was detected in the bloodstream during the first 24 h. Persistence was noted until the end of the experiment, i.e., at 14 days in rats. After intravenous inoculation in rats, the virus was first detected in the blood until 48 h and then in deep organs with infectious virus detected until 14 and 21 days in the liver and the spleen, respectively. Its DNA was detected for up to 30 days in the liver and the spleen. After aerosolization in mice, infectious Marseillevirus was present in the lungs and nasal associated lymphoid tissue until 30 days post inoculation but less frequently and at a lower viral load in the lung than in the nasal associated lymphoid tissue. No other site of dissemination was found after aerosol exposure. Despite no evidence of disease being observed, the 30-day long persistence of Marseillevirus in rats and mice, regardless of the route of inoculation, supports the hypothesis of an infective potential of the virus in certain conditions. Its constant and long-term detection in nasal associated lymphoid tissue in mice after an aerosol exposure suggests the involvement of naso-pharyngeal associated lymphoid tissues in protecting the host against environmental Marseillevirus.

Here, we characterized the K18-hACE2 mouse model expressing human (h)ACE2 in mice, controlled by the human keratin 18 (K18) promoter, in the epithelia, including airway epithelial cells where SARSCoV-2 infections typically start. We found that intranasal inoculation with higher viral doses (2 x 10(3) and 2 x 10(4) PFU) of SARS-CoV-2 caused lethality of all mice and severe damage of various organs, including lung, liver, and kidney, while lower doses (2 x 10(1) and 2 x 10(2) PFU) led to less severe tissue damage and some mice recovered from the infection. In this hACE2 mouse model, SARS-CoV-2 infection damaged multiple tissues, with a dose-dependent effect in most tissues. Similar damage was observed in postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. Finally, the mice that recovered from infection with a low dose of virus survived rechallenge with a high dose of virus. Compared to other existing models, the K18-hACE2 model seems to be the most sensitive COVID-19 model reported to date. Our work expands the information available about this model to include analysis of multiple infectious doses and various tissues with comparison to human postmortem samples from COVID-19 patients. In conclusion, the K18-hACE2 mouse model recapitulates both severe and non-severe COVID-19 in humans being dose-dependent and can provide insight into disease progression and the efficacy of therapeutics for preventing or treating COVID-19.IMPORTANCE The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has reached nearly 240 million cases, caused nearly 5 million deaths worldwide as of October 2021, and has raised an urgent need for the development of novel drugs and therapeutics to prevent the spread and pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To achieve this goal, an animal model that recapitulates the features of human COVID-19 disease progress and pathogenesis is greatly needed. In this study, we have comprehensively characterized a mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection using K18-hACE2 transgenic mice. We infected the mice with low and high doses of SARS-CoV-2 to study the pathogenesis and survival in response to different infection patterns. Moreover, we compared the pathogenesis of the K18-hACE2 transgenic mice with that of the COVID-19 patients to show that this model could be a useful tool for the development of antiviral drugs and therapeutics.

Natural and Experimental infections produced in different species of animais by L. tropica- A summary is given of the recorded cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in the dog, from which it appears that the condition is not common. Some of the facts seem to suggest that one or more species of parasite different from L. tropica may be responsible for such lesions.Experiments are cited to show that the dog, cat, monkeys of various species, mice, rat, guineapig, dormouse and merion can be successfully infected with L. tropica.Among the animais in which no successes have been obtained are, the donkey, horse, goat, sheep, rabbit, sparrow, pigeon, and certain lizards.The general conclusions drawn may be summarised as follows: - The parasite responsible for the disease in dogs cannot be distinguished morphologically from L. infantum, and clinically the natural disease of the dog closely resembles the condition set up in that species by inoculation with L. infantum. And, while there are still some points that require elucidation, the probabilities appear to be in favour of the view that the two parasites are identical.With regard to the identity of the Mediterranean and the Indian diseases, it cannot be objected that animais that are susceptible to the one are refractory to the other, but dogs are certainly less susceptible to the Indian than to the Mediterranean infection, and, while it has been found possible to produce cutaneous lesions in monkeys with L. donovani, all attempts to produce similar lesions with L. infantum have so far failed. The unique experiments in which a eynomolgus monkey which was immune to the Mediterranean disease failed to bocome infected when inoculated with the" Indian virus furnished valuable evidence regarding the identity of the two conditions.With regard to the production of cutaneous lesions in animais with L. tropica, the question is put whether L. tropica may not be a variety of L. donovani or L. infantum, which has become adapted to certain conditions of existence or transmission that are difierent in some way from those obtaining in the case of these two parasites.

U.R.S.S.				8				484	492						1940	1940	These three papers give a full account of the results of scientific expeditions during the years 1937-9, to the wooded districts of Far Eastern provinces of the Soviet Union, where tick-borne (spring-summer) encephalitis is endemic. This disease has been shown to be due to a filterable virus, transmitted to man by the bites of ticks of the family Ixodidae. Ixodes persul-catus appears to be the chief culprit and is often found to be infected with the virus even in districts where there is no human population. Virus has been recovered from the brains of several species of indigenous mammals which probably form a large virus reservoir but the ticks can also transmit the virus to their progeny through the eggs and larval forms.The human disease has a characteristic seasonal incidence, 80 per cent, of the cases occurring in May and June. This period follows immediately upon the period of maximal activity of those species of tick known to harbour virus. Outbreaks coincide with human invasion of the weeds or forestry and reclamation work. In inhabited districts domestic animals may also help in the spread of infection, for infected ticks have been found on them in all areas where the disease occurs; moreover, virus-neutralizing antibodies are present in the sera of a considerable percentage of cattle and horses.A clinical account of the disease in human beings is given; the pathology and morbid histology are also described.The virus is essentially neurotropic and infective by experimental inoculation for certain species of monkeys, rodents and birds. White mice are especially susceptible and succumb to either inoculation by various routes or the bites of infected ticks. The virus may be recoverable from the blood or the cerebrospinal fluid of human cases during the acute stages of the disease, but the method of choice is the intracerebral inoculation of mice with an emulsion of brain from a fatal case. The many strains of virus isolated at different times, in different localities and from different animal species have been found to be antigenically identical and quite distinct from the viruses of Japanese summer and St. Louis encephalitis.

Intramuscular (i.m.) in the forelimb; 2. I.m. in the hindlimb; 3. Subcutaneous (s.c.) in the abdominal wall; 4. Intraperitoneal (i.p.). Spread of virus was followed by immunohistochemical demonstration of viral antigen in tissue sections of the peripheral and central nervous system. Three distinct patterns emerged: 1. After i.m. limb inoculations, virus progressed along the ipsilateral dorsal column, the bilateral spinothalamic and bilateral spinoreticular systems and along central autonomic pathways. 2. After s.c. inoculation, the dorsal column was spared, otherwise the spread was similar to that following i.m. inoculations. 3. After i.p. inoculation, virus spread in the spinal cord bilaterally, mainly along spinothalamic and central autonomic pathways. The peripheral motoneurons were conspicuously spared, even in the i.m. inoculation mode. In the brain stem, B virus antigen appeared bilaterally, at multiple sites. In the cerebrum, virus infected cells appeared first in the thalamus, hypothalamus and the motor cortex. The mode of spread from spinal levels was mainly orthograde along the ascending systems (dorsal columns, spinothalamic, spinoreticular tracts), but also retrograde along descending systems (pyramidal tract, central autonomic pathways). Oligosynaptic systems transmitted virus more quickly than the polysynaptic ones. In the involvement of various neuronal systems in virus spread, a certain selectivity, sparing the peripheral motoneuron and the cerebellar systems, could be assessed.

J	Ruby, J; Bluethmann, H; Peschon, JJ								Antiviral activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is mediated via p55 and p75 TNF receptors								JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE				186	9			1591	1596		10.1084/jem.186.9.1591				NOV 3 1997	1997	The antiviral nature of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is generally well accepted. TNF appears to induce multiple antiviral mechanisms, and to synergize with interferon (IFN)-gamma in promoting antiviral activities. We infected TNF receptor (TNFR)-deficient mice with the virulent murine pathogen, ectromelia virus (EV), and observed that otherwise resistant mice were susceptible to lethal infection. To study the molecular basis of the antiviral action of TNF, mice were infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding murine TNF (VV-HA-TNF). In normal mice, the replication of VV-HA-TNF was highly attenuated. In contrast, mice in which the TNFR type 1 (p55) or the TNFR type 2 (p75) were genetically disrupted showed a moderate defect in their capacity to clear the TNF-encoding virus. The contribution of both TNF receptors to the control of VV-HA-TNF was confirmed by the enhanced replication of VV-HA-TNF in mice deficient for both p55 and p75. These observations were corroborated by infecting TNFR-deficient mice with EV. For both infections, the p55 and p75 TNFRs were necessary to maintain normal levels of resistance. Thus, the antiviral activity of TNF is mediated via both TNFRs in vivo. Furthermore, these studies establish that TNF is an important component of the host response to a natural virus infection.																					WOS:A1997YE94200020	9348317

Human Cytomegalovirus US28 Ligand Binding Activity Is Required for Latency in CD34(+) Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells and Humanized NSG Mice								MBIO				10	4					e01889-19	10.1128/mBio.01889-19				JUL-AUG 2019	2019	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34(+) HPCs) provides a critical reservoir of virus in stem cell transplant patients, and viral reactivation remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. The HCMV chemokine receptor US28 is implicated in the regulation of viral latency and reactivation. To explore the role of US28 signaling in latency and reactivation, we analyzed protein tyrosine kinase signaling in CD34(+) HPCs expressing US28. US28-ligand signaling in CD34(+) HPCs induced changes in key regulators of cellular activation and differentiation. In vitro latency and reactivation assays utilizing CD34(+) HPCs indicated that US28 was required for viral reactivation but not latency establishment or maintenance. Similarly, humanized NSG mice (huNSG) infected with TB40E-GFP-US28stop failed to reactivate upon treatment with granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor, but viral genome levels were maintained. Interestingly, HCMV-mediated changes in hematopoiesis during latency in vivo and in vitro was also dependent upon US28, as US28 directly promoted differentiation toward the myeloid lineage. To determine whether US28 constitutive activity and/or ligand-binding activity were required for latency and reactivation, we infected both huNSG mice and CD34(+) HPCs in vitro with HCMV TB40E-GFP containing the US28-R129A mutation (no CA) or Y16F mutation (no ligand binding). TB40E-GFP-US28-R129A was maintained during latency and exhibited normal reactivation kinetics. In contrast, TB40E-GFP-US28-Y16F exhibited high levels of viral genome during latency and reactivation, indicating that the virus did not establish latency. These data indicate that US28 is necessary for viral reactivation and ligand binding activity is required for viral latency, highlighting the complex role of US28 during HCMV latency and reactivation.IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) can establish latency following infection of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), and reactivation from latency is a significant cause of viral disease and accelerated graft failure in bone marrow and solid-organ transplant patients. The precise molecular mechanisms of HCMV infection in HPCs are not well defined; however, select viral gene products are known to regulate aspects of latency and reactivation. The HCMV-encoded chemokine receptor US28, which binds multiple CC chemokines as well as CX3CR1, is expressed both during latent and lytic phases of the virus life cycle and plays a role in latency and reactivation. However, the specific timing of US28 expression and the role of ligand binding in these processes are not well defined. In this report, we determined that US28 is required for reactivation but not for maintaining latency. However, when present during latency, US28 ligand binding activity is critical to maintaining the virus in a quiescent state. We attribute the regulation of both latency and reactivation to the role of US28 in promoting myeloid lineage cell differentiation. These data highlight the dynamic and multifunctional nature of US28 during HCMV latency and reactivation.																					WOS:000493912200003	31431555

Both types remained fully virulent for pigs arid g. pigs. Of 17 cattle inoculated s/c with the avirulent type O2 virus 11 were strongly immune and 4 partially immune to challenge infection 2-3 weeks later.

Although such viral contaminants can be easily identified with high sensitivity by PCR, it is impossible to screen for all potential contaminants. Therefore, we explored two novel methods to identify viral contaminations in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant.Results: The first hint for the presence of contaminating retroviruses in one of our cell lines was obtained by electron microscopy of exosome-like vesicles released from the supernatants of transfected 293T cells. Random amplification of particle associated RNAs (PAN-PCR) from supernatant of contaminated 293T cells and sequencing of the amplicons revealed several nucleotide sequences showing highest similarity to either murine leukemia virus (MuLV) or squirrel monkey retrovirus (SMRV). Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis confirmed our findings, since we could identify several peptide sequences originating from monkey and murine retroviral proteins. Quantitative PCRs were established for both viruses to test currently cultured cell lines as well as liquid nitrogen frozen cell stocks. Gene fragments for both viruses could be detected in a broad range of permissive cell lines from multiple species. Furthermore, experimental infections of cells negative for these viruses showed that both viruses replicate rapidly to high loads. We decided to further analyze the genomic sequence of the MuLV-like contaminant virus. Surprisingly it was neither identical to MuLV nor to the novel xenotropic MuLV related retrovirus (XMRV) but showed 99% identity to a synthetic retrovirus which was engineered in the 1980s.Conclusion: The high degree of nucleotide identity suggests unintended spread of a biosafety level 2 recombinant virus, which could also affect the risk assessment of gene-modified organisms released from contaminated cell cultures. The study further indicates that both mass spectrometry and PAN-PCR are powerful methods to identify viral contaminations in cell lines without prior knowledge of the kind of contaminant. Both methods might be useful tools for testing cell lines before using them for critical purposes.																					WOS:000271016200001	19772602

In attempting characterization of virus serological (hemagluttination inhibition, HI; indirect immunofluorescence assay, IFA), physicochemical [test for deoxycholate acid (DCA) sensitivity; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)] tests and ultrastructural studies were made. Virus was also assayed in suckling mice after intracerebral inoculation of 0.02 ml and in VERO and C6/36 cells with 0.1 ml of viral suspension containing 10(5) LD50/ml. Inoculated and control systems were observed daily. Every 24 h, one control and two inoculated animals were killed for tissue testing, including histopathological changes by haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained sections, which were semi-quantified. Research into viral antigen in the tissues of mice [central nervous system (CNS), liver, heart, lungs, spleen and kidneys] was carried out by the immunohistochemical technique using the peroxidase system. The virus only replicated in VERO cells, with antigen positive by IFA. Positive complement fixation tests were only obtained using antiserum of Minacu virus. Minacu virus is DCA resistant; haemagglutinating activity was negative. By electronic microscopy non-enveloped virus particles were 75 nm in diameter. PAGE analysis showed Minacu virus genome profile with 10 RNA segments. Infected, non-killed animals died 7 days after inoculation. Tissue lesions were observed in all organs, except the lungs. Intense lesions were observed in the CNS and the heart, where neurone and cardiocyte necroses, respectively, were noted. The liver, spleen and kidneys had moderate tissue changes. Viral antigens were more abundant in the CNS and the heart, and absent in the lungs. In conclusion, Minacu virus belongs to the family Reoviridae, genus Orbivirus.

The results of those studies on experimental infections of various pathogens in the inbred strains of mice indicate that genetic factors play a decisive role in resistance in mice. This paper reviews the present situation of such studies on genetic control of the resistance to infection in mice. The involvement of single dominant or recessive genes relates to the infections caused by more than 20 kinds of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, rickettsia and parasites. These single genes act independently in infections of relevant pathogens. A majority of those genes have been mapped on mice chromosomes. One of the important findings indicates that the same one gene plays an important role in providing resistance to phylogenetically different pathogens, i.e. Salmonella typhimurium, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG) and Leishmania donovani. A recent study on a mouse resistance to Japanese encephalitis virus shows that the resistance is controlled by one gene through its activation of cell-mediated immunity in the infected hosts.

Alloferon, which is isolated from the blood of an experimentally infected insect, the blow fly Calliphora vicina, is known for its anti-viral and anti-tumor activities in mice model. However, the effect of alloferon against UVB irradiation and its specific mechanism are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of alloferon on UVB-induced cutaneous inflammation in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. RPA and ELISA data showed that alloferon decreased the production of UVB-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6 and IL-18, both on the mRNA and protein level. Western blot analysis was done to determine if alloferon regulates the MAPK signaling pathway since the MAPK signaling pathway is activated by numerous inflammatory mediators and environmental stresses including UVB irradiation. Alloferon inhibited the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) induced by UVB irradiation. Furthermore, the topical application of alloferon on the UVB exposed skin of hairless mice showed that alloferon treatment significantly inhibited an increase in epithelial thickness in chronic UVB-irradiated mouse skin. These findings suggest that alloferon has significant anti-inflammatory effects not only on UVB-induced inflammation in the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, but also on mouse skin.

Puumala virus (PUUV) is the predominant endemic hantavirus in Europe. A large proportion of PUUV-infected patients suffer from gastrointestinal symptoms of unclear origin. In this study we demonstrate that PUUV infection can occur via the alimentary tract.Methods : We investigated susceptibility of the human small intestinal epithelium for PUUV infection and analyzed the resistance of virions to gastric juice. As model for intestinal virus translocation we performed infection experiments with human intestinal Caco-2 monolayers. In animal experiments we infected Syrian hamsters with PUUV via the intragastric route and tested seroconversion and protective immunity against subsequent Andes virus challenge.Results : PUUV retained infectivity in gastric juice at pH >3. The virus invaded Caco-2 monolayers in association with endosomal antigen EEA1, followed by virus replication and loss of epithelial barrier function with basolateral virus occurrence. Cellular disturbance and depletion of the tight junction protein ZO-1 appeared after prolonged infection, leading to paracellular leakage (leak flux diarrhea). Moreover, animal experiments led to dose-dependent seroconversion and protection against lethal Andes virus challenge.Conclusions : We provide evidence that hantavirus can infect the organism via the alimentary tract and suggest a novel aspect of hantavirus infection and pathogenesis.Significance : Hantaviruses are zoonotic pathogens causing severe hemorrhagic fevers worldwide. They are transmitted to humans by small mammals. To date, these viruses were thought to infect exclusively through the airborne route by inhalation of aerosols from infectious animal droppings or by rodent bites. In our work we could show that the alimentary tract is an alternative path of infection for hantaviruses, meaning a new association of virus and disease. These findings have impact on current textbook knowledge and bring many implications for hantavirus epidemiology and outbreak prevention measures.																					WOS:000409875800001	28943870

Mice models have been developed for experimental infection with human, but not bovine, respiratory syncytial virus strains. Here, it is shown that BRSV can replicate efficiently on primary cell cultures derived from type I IFN receptor-deficient, but not from wild-type IFN-competent, mice. However, BRSV infection was not enhanced in mice devoid of the type I IFN receptor. These results show that type I IFN is a major host-range determinant for infection at the cellular level, but that other factors control virus replication and pathology in vivo.

In this report, we define the transcriptome of MmuPV1 genome present in papillomas arising in experimentally infected mice using a combination of RNA-seq, PacBio Iso-seq, 5 RACE, 3 RACE, primer-walking RT-PCR, RNase protection, Northern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. We demonstrate that the MmuPV1 genome is transcribed unidirectionally from five major promoters (P) or transcription start sites (TSS) and polyadenylates its transcripts at two major polyadenylation (pA) sites. We designate the P7503, P360 and P859 as "early" promoters because they give rise to transcripts mostly utilizing the polyadenylation signal at nt 3844 and therefore can only encode early genes, and P7107 and P533 as "late" promoters because they give rise to transcripts utilizing polyadenylation signals at either nt 3844 or nt 7047, the latter being able to encode late, capsid proteins. MmuPV1 genome contains five splice donor sites and three acceptor sites that produce thirty-six RNA isoforms deduced to express seven predicted early gene products (E6, E7, E1, E1^M1, E1^M2, E2 and E8^E2) and three predicted late gene products (E1^E4, L2 and L1). The majority of the viral early transcripts are spliced once from nt 757 to 3139, while viral late transcripts, which are predicted to encode L1, are spliced twice, first from nt 7243 to either nt 3139 (P7107) or nt 757 to 3139 (P533) and second from nt 3431 to nt 5372. Thirteen of these viral transcripts were detectable by Northern blot analysis, with the P533-derived late E1^E4 transcripts being the most abundant. The late transcripts could be detected in highly differentiated keratinocytes of MmuPV1-infected tissues as early as ten days after MmuPV1 inoculation and correlated with detection of L1 protein and viral DNA amplification. In mature warts, detection of L1 was also found in more poorly differentiated cells, as previously reported. Subclinical infections were also observed. The comprehensive transcription map of MmuPV1 generated in this study provides further evidence that MmuPV1 is similar to high-risk cutaneous beta human papillomaviruses. The knowledge revealed will facilitate the use of MmuPV1 as an animal virus model for understanding of human papillomavirus gene expression, pathogenesis and immunology.

The arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) strain Clone 13 provides a benchmark model for studying chronic infection. A major genetic determinant for its ability to persist maps to a single amino acid exchange in the viral L protein, which exhibits RdRp activity, yet its functional consequences remain elusive. To unravel the L protein interactions with the host proteome, we engineered infectious L protein-tagged LCMV virions by reverse genetics. A subsequent mass-spectrometric analysis of L protein pulldowns from infected human cells revealed a comprehensive network of interacting host proteins. The obtained LCMV L protein interactome was bioinformatically integrated with known host protein interactors of RdRps from other RNA viruses, emphasizing interconnected modules of human proteins. Functional characterization of selected interactors highlighted proviral (DDX3X) as well as antiviral (NKRF, TRIM21) host factors. To corroborate these findings, we infected Trim21-/- mice with LCMV and found impaired virus control in chronic infection. These results provide insights into the complex interactions of the arenavirus LCMV and other viral RdRps with the host proteome and contribute to a better molecular understanding of how chronic viruses interact with their host.

Different strains of the virus are recognized on the basis of tissue tropism and host response; however, none have been shown to be serologically distinct. The symptomatology and host response in experimental infections are dependent on factors such as strain and age of the mice, strain and dose of virus, and route of inoculation. In natoral infections, transmission is effected by contact and the intrauterine route, gross symptoms are vague, and virus is distributed throughout the tissues of the murine host. Wild mice are the assumed reservoir of infection. Most mammals respond to acute LCM infection with neutralizing and complement-fixing antibody; however, mice are limited to the complement-fixing response. Control of LCM is imperative, not only for its potentiality to induce experimental artifact but also for its role as a potential human pathogen. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author					Symposium on viruses of laboratory rodents, Atlanta, Georgia, 25-26 January, 1965 National Cancer Institute Bethesda, MarylandSymposium on viruses of laboratory rodents, Atlanta, Georgia, 25-26 January, 1965 National Cancer Institute Bethesda, Maryland																BCI:BCI19664700108804	5907690

J	YAMAZAKI, HIDEHIKO								Studies on the influence of influenza virus infection on experimental pulmonary tuberculosis in mice								NIHON UNIV J MED				9	(3)			311	339						1967	1967	The state of viruses in the respirat ory tract of mice which were experimentally infected with influenza virus, and the effect of superinfection with influenza virus on the experimental pulmonary tuberculosis in mice was studied. In mice intranasally infected with influenza virus, antigens were observed 4 hr. and alveolus; the specific fluorescence continued to increase in number and intensity reaching the maximum at 48 hr. Virus particles were released adjacent to free surface of cell membranes of bronchial epitherial cells at 12 hr. through 48 hr. The survival rate in the superinfected group began to fall in the 2nd week after the influenza instillation and in the 3rd week to a higher degree than the tuberculosis-alone group and virus-alone group. Pulmonary and bronchial involvements in the super-infected group caused more intense changes in bronchial system than in the tuberculosis alone group, and tubercles in the former were usually more numerous and larger. The quantity of tubercular bacilli in the tissue was increased in the 2nd week and in the 3rd week a significant difference was observed. The superinfected group showed more intense findings of detachment, desquamation and destruction, of bronchial epithelial cells together with the obstruction of the bronchial spaces than in the influenza-alone group. Antituberculotics and an antiviral agent inhibited the influenza-alone, the tuberculosis-alone and the superinfection groups by reducing the survival rates. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth																					BCI:BCI19684900085118

Antiviral Activity of Ingavirin (R) in Experimental Lethal Influenza Due to Influenza Virus B in Albino Mice								Antibiotiki i Khimioterapiya				55	3-4			8	11						2010	2010	The protective activity of Ingavirin (R) against experimental infection caused by influenza B virus was studied on albino mice vs. Arbidol (R). Oral use of Ingavirin (R) was shown to decrease the infectious titers of the virus in the animal lung tissue, to normalize the body weight dynamics, to lower the mortality and to increase the average lifespan vs. the placebo-treated animals. The activity of Ingavirin (R) was higher than that of the reference drug. The results allowed to consider Ingavirin (R) as a prospective agent for the treatment of influenza infection in humans.																					BCI:BCI201000475305	20695201

Meningo-encephalo-myelite infectieuse du cheval en U.R.S.S.				Recueil de Medecine Veterinaire				111				357	364						1935	1935	The authors have made a study of infectious equine meningo-encephalo-myelitis as it occurs in the U.S.S.R. They describe the symptoms shown by affected animals and demonstrate that a filtrable virus is responsible for the condition. The major part of the article relates to transmission experiments which were carried out with three strains of the virus, one of them having been obtained from an outbreak of the disease in Siberia. In addition to the horse, the cat, rabbit, guineapig, rat, mouse and pig were found to be susceptible on experimental inoculation. The dog was not susceptible. In comparative studies with other Russian encephalomyelitis strains, a feature was the susceptibility of the cat, which is not susceptible to the virus of Borna disease nor to the American strains of encephalomyelitis virus.Other experiments refer to the demonstration of the virus in the liver, kidneys, saliva, urine and scrapings of intestinal mucous membrane of experimental cats.In addition, mention is made of the viability of this virus, its resistance to chemicals and the properties of hyperimmune sera prepared against two of the strains. The sera possessed virucidal properties against homologous antigens and also against the virus of rabies, but were not virucidal to the virus of Borna disease and the eastern and western American strains of encephalomyelitis virus.-D.

Human enteroviruses have rarely been isolated from animals, and their occurrence in these hosts appears to be exceptional. Possible explanations for the presence of antibodies against human enteroviruses in animal sera are an antigenic relationship between human and animal enteroviruses, and a variable antigenic response of animals. Haag discussed the enteroviruses of pigs: those causing spontaneous disease, those causing symptoms only in experimentally infected pigs, and the non-pathogenic ECPO viruses.-M.G.G.

Herpesvirus delivery to the murine respiratory tract								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS				206				105	114		10.1016/j.jviromet.2014.06.003				SEP 15 2014	2014	Herpesvirus transmission is sporadic, and infection may be asymptomatic or present only with secondary lesions after dissemination. Consequently host entry remains ill-understood. Experimental infections can be informative, but depend on inoculations that are inherently artificial and so need validation. Mice are a widely used experimental host. Alert mice inhale readily small (5 mu l) liquid volumes, and Indian ink, luciferase or radiolabel delivered thus distributed to the nasopharynx and oropharynx. Murid Herpesvirus-4 or Herpes simplex virus type 1 delivered thus infected only the nose, arguing that host entry is nasal rather than oral. Marker or virus delivery to the lung depended on general anesthesia and a large inoculum volume (30 mu l and so needs further validation of physiological relevance. While lungs could be infected at lower doses than the upper respiratory tract, tracking experiments showed that nasal inocula pass mostly into the oropharynx, even when restricted to 1 mu l. Thus, the relative inefficiency of experimental upper respiratory tract infection was attributable to limited liquid retention in this site. Nonetheless low volume intranasal delivery to alert mice provides a convenient way to model experimentally an apparently natural mode of herpesvirus host entry. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The inhibitory action of the complex is considerable in surviving chorioalantoic membranes when applied before or simultaneously with the viruses H0N1 and N3N2, and remains strong against H0N1 when applied 1 hour after the infection. The complex shows a pronounced prophylactic effect on mice experimentally infected with A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2).

J	LEVKOVICH, E. N.								Serological Blood Characteristics of the Population in the endemic Region of Tick-borne (Spring-Summer) Encephalitis.								Travaux Acad. milit. Med. Kiroff Armee Rouge				25				19	22						1941	1941	Observations in the Russian Far East have shown that the prevalence of spring-summer encephalitis in endemic foci and the mortality caused vary inversely with the length of time that the inhabitants have been settled in them. To ascertain whether this is due to a gradually acquired immunity [cf. R.A.E., B 31 70], serological tests of the population from areas in the forest, some of which had been cleared, were carried out in 1937 and 1938, and are discussed in the first paper. The results showed that about a third of a group of local inhabitants who had not suffered from the disease possessed protective antibodies in their blood, as compared with a negligible proportion among the medical staff and other newly arrived persons. It is concluded that a latent immunization of the population takes place irrespective of their contact with cases of encephalitis, and that it is acquired in the forest through the bites of naturally infected ticks.The part played by ticks in such natural immunization was confirmed by the experiments described in the second paper. They were carried out in May 1939 with adult females of Ixodes persulcatus, Schulze, that had fed for two days on mice artificially'infected with a human strain of the virus and nymphs of Haemaphysalis concinna, Koch, and adults of Dermacentor silvarum, Olen., that had acquired the virus in the larval and nymphal stages, respectively, in 1938. From one to six ticks were allowed to feed for three or six days on healthy mice, and the resistance of the latter was then tested by injecting into them 2, 5 or 25 minimum lethal doses of the virus. Some of the mice proved to be resistant to infection, even with the highest dosage, and their blood was found to contain antibodies that rendered the virus inactive. The degree of immunity varied with the number of ticks used per mouse and the duration of feeding.																					CABI:19461000136

Over one hundred persons received two doses of CEC vaccine at an interval of one week and produced high level of neutralizing antibody against rabies virus. The monkeys experimentally infected with street rabies virus were satisfactorily protected by subcutaneous inoculation with CEC vaccine one hour after exposure. Eight persons bitten by dogs known to have rabies or suspected of it, survived after post-exposure treatment with CEC vaccine.																					MEDLINE:98373	98373

With the exception of variola virus (VARV), the etiological agent of smallpox, other OPV have been reported to persist in a variety of animal species following natural or experimental infection. Despite the implications and significance for the ecology and epidemiology of diseases these viruses cause, those reports have never been thoroughly investigated. We used the mouse pathogen ectromelia virus (ECTV), the agent of mousepox and a close relative of VARV to investigate virus persistence in inbred mice. We provide evidence that ECTV causes a persistent infection in some susceptible strains of mice in which low levels of virus genomes were detected in various tissues late in infection. The bone marrow (BM) and blood appeared to be key sites of persistence. Contemporaneous with virus persistence, antiviral CD8 T cell responses were demonstrable over the entire 25-week study period, with a change in the immunodominance hierarchy evident during the first 3 weeks. Some virus-encoded host response modifiers were found to modulate virus persistence whereas host genes encoded by the NKC and MHC class I reduced the potential for persistence. When susceptible strains of mice that had apparently recovered from infection were subjected to sustained immunosuppression with cyclophosphamide (CTX), animals succumbed to mousepox with high titers of infectious virus in various organs. CTX treated index mice transmitted virus to, and caused disease in, co-housed naive mice. The most surprising but significant finding was that immunosuppression of disease-resistant C57BL/6 mice several weeks after recovery from primary infection generated high titers of virus in multiple tissues. Resistant mice showed no evidence of a persistent infection. This is the strongest evidence that ECTV can persist in inbred mice, regardless of their resistance status.

Manufacturing processes for the biologics have the risk of viral contamination. Therefore viral validation is essential in ensuring the safety of the products. Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is one of the common bovine pathogens and has widely been known as a contaminant of biologics. In order to establish the validation system for the BPIV3 safety of biologics, a real-time RT-PCR method was developed for quantitative detection of BPIV3 contamination in raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products. Specific primers for amplification of BPIV3 RNA was selected, and BPIV3 RNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green I. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 2.8 TCID50/mL. The real-time RT-PCR method was validated to be reproducible and very specific to BPIV3. The established real-time RT-PCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with BPIV3. BPIV3 RNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culture supernatant. Also the real-time RT-PCR assay could detect 7.8 TCID50/mL of BPIV3 artificially contaminated in bovine collagen. The overall results indicated that this rapid, specific, sensitive, and robust assay can be reliably used for quantitative detection of BPIV3 contamination during the manufacture of biologics.

Pirital virus infection in the hamsters was characterized by high titered viremia, leukocytosis, coagulopathy, pulmonary hemorrhage and edema, hepatocellular and splenic necrosis, and marked elevation of serum transaminase levels. All of the animals died within 9 days. The clinical and histopathological findings in the Pirital virus-infected hamsters were very similar to those reported in severe human cases of Lassa fever, suggesting that this new animal model could serve as a low-cost and relatively safe alternative for studying the pathogenesis and therapy of Lassa fever.

LAT Region Factors Mediating Differential Neuronal Tropism of HSV-1 and HSV-2 Do Not Act in Trans								PLOS ONE				7	12					e53281	10.1371/journal.pone.0053281				DEC 31 2012	2012	After HSV infection, some trigeminal ganglion neurons support productive cycle gene expression, while in other neurons the virus establishes a latent infection. We previously demonstrated that HSV-1 and HSV-2 preferentially establish latent infection in A5+ and KH10+ sensory neurons, respectively, and that exchanging the latency-associated transcript (LAT) between HSV-1 and HSV-2 also exchanges the neuronal preference. Since many viral genes besides the LAT are functionally interchangeable between HSV-1 and HSV-2, we co-infected HSV-1 and HSV-2, both in vivo and in vitro, to determine if transacting viral factors regulate whether HSV infection follows a productive or latent pattern of gene expression in sensory neurons. The pattern of HSV-1 and HSV-2 latent infection in trigeminal neurons was no different following co-infection than with either virus alone, consistent with the hypothesis that a trans-acting viral factor is not responsible for the different patterns of latent infection of HSV-1 and HSV-2 in A5+ and KH10+ neurons. Since exchanging the LAT regions between the viruses also exchanges neuronal preferences, we infected transgenic mice that constitutively express 2.8 kb of the LAT region with the heterologous viral serotype. Endogenous expression of LAT did not alter the pattern of latent infection after inoculation with the heterologous serotype virus, demonstrating that the LAT region does not act in trans to direct preferential establishment of latency of HSV-1 and HSV-2. Using HSV1-RFP and HSV2-GFP in adult trigeminal ganglion neurons in vitro, we determined that HSV-1 and HSV-2 do not exert trans-acting effects during acute infection to regulate neuron specificity. Although some neurons were productively infected with both HSV-1 and HSV-2, no A5+ or KH10+ neurons were productively infected with both viruses. Thus, trans-acting viral factors do not regulate preferential permissiveness of A5+ and KH10+ neurons for productive HSV infection and preferential establishment of latent infection.

Application of treatment course of consecutive alternating administration (CAA) of triple combination of enterovirus replication inhibitors in experimental infections (20 MLD50) with coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) strains in newborn mice is presented. It was established that in infection with cardiotropic Woodruff strain the combination of pleconaril, MDL-860 and oxoglaucine (PMO) subjected to the CAA scheme, a significant protective effect was observed. Monotherapeutic courses as well as simultaneously daily applied PMO were without effect. Analogous data were observed at experimental infection with the neurotriopic Nancy strain of CVB3. Following IC50 values of virus samples taken every day from target organs of infected animals during the whole period of study, a drug-resistance was established in monotherapy with compounds-partners in the PMO combination. At courses by the treatment scheme CAA of PMO development of drug-resistance was not established, but an increased susceptibility to the effect of the inhibitor-components in the combination was proven.

The LASV-rNP was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system. IASV-rNP was used as an antigen in the detection of LASV-antibodies and as an immunogen for the production of monoclonal antibodies. The LASV-rNP was also expressed in HeLa cells by transfection with the expression vector encoding cDNA of the LASV-NP gene. An immunoglobulin G enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using LASV-rNP and an indirect immunofluoreseence assay using LASV-rNP-expressing HeLa cells were confirmed to have high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of LASV-antibodies. A novel monoclonal antibody to LASV-rNP, monoclonal antibody 4A5, was established. A sandwich antigen capture (Ag-capture) ELISA using the monoclonal antibody and an anti-LASV-rNP rabbit serum as capture and detection antibodies, respectively, was then developed. Authentic LASV nucleoprotein in serum samples collected from hamsters experimentally infected with LASV was detected by the Ag-capture ELISA. The Ag-capture ELISA specifically detected IASV-rNP but not the rNPs of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or Junin virus. The sensitivity of the Ag-capture ELISA in detecting ILASV antigens was comparable to that of reverse transcription-PCR in detecting LASV RNA. These LASV rNP-based diagnostics were confirmed to be useful in the diagnosis of LF even in institutes without a high containment laboratory, since the antigens can be prepared without manipulation of the infectious viruses.

Recent A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, that is, A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses circulating in the post-pandemic era, can cause more or less severe infections than those caused by the initial pandemic viruses. To evaluate the changes in pathogenicity of the A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during their continued circulation in humans, we compared the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of ten A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses isolated in Japan between 2009 and 2015, and experimentally infected mice with each virus. The severity of infection caused by these Japanese isolates ranged from milder to more severe than that caused by the prototypic pandemic strain A/California/04/2009 (CA04/09); however, specific mutations responsible for their pathogenicity have not yet been identified.

However, the use of human viruses is limited by the patients' antiviral immune response. In this study, we investigated an alternative oncolytic strategy using non-human pathogen viruses as the bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) that were able to interact with CD46. Methods We treated several human myeloma cell lines and non-myeloma cell lines with BVDV to evaluate the expression of CD46 and to study the effect on cell viability by flow cytometry. The possible synergistic effect of bortezomib in combination with BVDV was also tested. Moreover, we infected the bone marrow mononuclear cells obtained from myeloma patients and we checked the BVDV effect on different cell populations, defined by CD138, CD14, CD3, CD19, and CD56 expression evaluated by flow cytometry. Finally, the in vivo BVDV effect was tested in NOD-SCID mice injected subcutaneously with myeloma cell lines. Results Human myeloma cells were selectively sensitive to BVDV treatment with an increase of cell death and, consequently, of apoptotic markers. Consistently, bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from myeloma patients treated with BVDV, showed a significant selective decrease of the percentage of viable CD138(+)cells. Interestingly, bortezomib pre-treatment significantly increased the cytotoxic effect of BVDV in myeloma cell lines with a synergistic effect. Finally, the in vitro data were confirmed in an in vivo myeloma mouse model showing that BVDV treatment significantly reduced the tumoral burden compared to the vehicle. Conclusions Overall, our data indicate, for the first time, a direct oncolytic effect of the BVDV in human myeloma cells suggesting its possible use as novel alternative anti-myeloma virotherapy strategy.

The genesis of these diseases is believed to be associated with the route (mucosa versus blood) and mode (cell-free versus cell-associated) of primary infection as well as the modulation of dendritic cell (DC) functions. To explore the role of DCs during early HTLV-1 infection in vivo, we used a chimeric HTLV-1 with a replaced envelope gene from Moloney murine leukemia virus to allow HTLV-1 to fuse with murine cells, which are generally not susceptible to infection with human retroviruses. We also used a CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model system that permits conditional transient depletion of CD11c(+) DCs. We infected these transgenic mice with HTLV-1 using both cell-free and cell-associated infection routes in the absence and presence of DCs. The ablation of DCs led to an enhanced susceptibility to infection with cell-free but not cell-associated HTLV-1 in both CD4 and non-CD4 fractions, as measured by the proviral load. Infection with cell-free virus in the absence of DCs was also found to have increased levels of Tax mRNA in the non-CD4 fraction. Moreover, depletion of DCs significantly dampened the cellular immune response (IFN-gamma(+)CD8(+) T cells) against both cell-free and cell-associated virus. These results uniquely differentiate the involvement of DCs in early cell-free versus late cell-associated infection of HTLV-1 and highlight a significant aspect of viral immunopathogenesis related to the progression of adult T cell leukemia and HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis after the initial infection.

OBJECTIVE To describe the severe histopathological aspects of YFV infection, 10 squirrel monkeys were infected with YFV and blood, brain, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, lung, lymph node and stomach were collected at 1-7, 10, 20 and 30 days post-infection (dpi). METHODS Histopathological analysis and detection of the genome and viral antigens and neutralising antibodies were performed by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and neutralisation test, respectively. FINDINGS Only one animal died from the experimental infection. The genome and viral antigens were detected in all investigated organs (1-30 dpi) and the neutralising antibodies from seven to 30 dpi. The brain contained perivascular haemorrhage (6 dpi); in the liver, midzonal haemorrhage and lytic necrosis (6 dpi) were observed. The kidney had bleeding in the Bowmans capsule and tubular necrosis (6 dpi). Pyknotic lymphocytes were observed in the spleen (1-20 dpi), the lung had haemorrhage (2-6 dpi), in the endocardium it contained nuclear pyknosis and necrosis (2-3 dpi) and the stomach contained blood in the lumen (6 dpi). MAIN FINDINGS Squirrel monkeys reliably reproduced the responses observed in human cases of yellow fever and, therefore, constitute an excellent experimental model for studies on the pathophysiology of the disease.

Three avian origin isolates were selected, two strains obtained from ostrich (one of which contained a PB2-627 Lysine residue) and one from a chicken. Following intranasal infection of mice, clinical signs and mortality were recorded in the experimental groups challenged with the two ostrich isolates, while only weight loss was observed in those receiving the chicken strain. Viruses were recovered to a varying extent from respiratory and nervous tissues of infected animals. These results suggest that HPAI viruses, other than H5N1 and H7N7, may have zoonotic implications, and support the consensus that Al infections in poultry are to be eradicated rather than contained.

Rapid Evolution of HIV-1 to Functional CD8(+) T Cell Responses in Humanized BLT Mice								SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				4	143					143ra98	10.1126/scitranslmed.3003984				JUL 18 2012	2012	The development of mouse/human chimeras through the engraftment of human immune cells and tissues into immunodeficient mice, including the recently described humanized BLT (bone marrow, liver, thymus) mouse model, holds great promise to facilitate the in vivo study of human immune responses. However, little data exist regarding the extent to which cellular immune responses in humanized mice accurately reflect those seen in humans. We infected humanized BLT mice with HIV-1 as a model pathogen and characterized HIV-1-specific immune responses and viral evolution during the acute phase of infection. HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in these mice were found to closely resemble those in humans in terms of their specificity, kinetics, and immunodominance. Viral sequence evolution also revealed rapid and highly reproducible escape from these responses, mirroring the adaptations to host immune pressures observed during natural HIV-1 infection. Moreover, mice expressing the protective HLA-B*57 allele exhibited enhanced control of viral replication and restricted the same CD8(+) T cell responses to conserved regions of HIV-1 Gag that are critical to its control of HIV-1 in humans. These data reveal that the humanized BLT mouse model appears to accurately recapitulate human pathogen-specific cellular immunity and the fundamental immunological mechanisms required to control a model human pathogen, aspects critical to the use of a small-animal model for human pathogens.

The Aab-2s were specific against the idiotypic antibodies (Ab-Is) to the envelope glycoprotein GP5 of PRRSV and were detected from serum samples collected between 21 and 98 days post-infection (DPI). Serological characterization indicated that the Aab-2s recognized the idiotype located within or near the antigen-combining sites of the anti-GP5 antibodies, which was shared by both mouse MAb anti-GP5 and swine polyclonal antibodies. The fact that the Aab-2 inhibited the anti-GP5 antibodies from binding to PRRSV and that they were detected at different time periods in pigs that cleared the infection prior to 98 DPI versus pigs in which virus was detected at 98 DPI suggests that Aab-2 antibodies may play a role in immunity to PRRSV infection.

Effective medications and/or prophylactic vaccines against HFMD are urgently needed. From a scientific (the feasibility of bioprocess, immunological responses and potency in animal challenge model) and business development (cost of goods) points of view, we in this review address and discuss the pros and cons of different EV71 vaccine candidates that have been produced and evaluated in animal models. Epitope-based synthetic peptide vaccine candidates containing residues 211-225 of VP1 formulated with Freund's adjuvant (CFA/IFA) elicited low EV71 virus neutralizing antibody responses, but were protective in the suckling mouse challenge model. Among recombinant EV71 subunits (rVP1, rVP2 and rVP3) expressed in E. coli, purified and formulated with CFA/IFA, only VP1 elicited mouse antibody responses with measurable EV71-specific virus neutralization titers. Immunization of mice with either a DNA plasmid containing VP1 gene or VP1 expressed in Salmonella typhimurium also generated neutralizing antibody responses and protected animals against a live EV71 challenge. Recombinant EV71 virus-like particles (rVLP) produced from baculovirus formulated either with CFA/IFA or alum elicited good virus neutralization titers in both mice and non-human primates, and were found to be protective in the suckling mouse EV71 challenge model. Synthetic peptides or recombinant EV71 subunit vaccines (rVP1 and rVLP) formulated in alum were found to be poorly immunogenic in rabbits. Only formalin-inactivated (FI) EV71 virions formulated in alum elicited cross-neutralizing antibodies against different EV71 genotypes in mice, rabbits and non-human primates but induced weak neutralizing responses against CAV16. From a regulatory, economic and market acceptability standpoint, FI-EV71 virion vaccines are the most promising candidates and are currently being evaluated in human clinical trials. We further describe and analyze some new bioprocesses technologies that have great potential applications in EV71 vaccine development. This review also demonstrates the opportunities and challenges that the Asian vaccine industry faces today.																					MEDLINE:22992566	22992566

In this study, we analyzed AIVs present in LBMs in Korea during the winter seasons of 2006-08. Sixty-five AIVs that belong to four hemagglutination (HA) subtypes of AIV (H3, H4, H6, and H9) were isolated from 644 pooled tissue or swab samples collected in LBMs. Most H9 subtypes of AIVs were isolated from Galliformes (chickens, silky fowls, pheasants, and guinea fowls), and other subtypes were isolated from Anseriformes (Pekin ducks and mallards). In addition, we obtained a single H3N2 virus from nasal swabs of dogs sold in LBMs, and the virus was genetically identical to the canine influenza virus (CIV) isolated from per dogs in Korea. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the Korean H9N2 viruses prevalent in chickens have provided their gene segments to AIVs circulating in ducks. These gene transfers facilitated reassortment events among AIVs and likely generated the ancestors of CIV in Korea. An animal challenge study using chickens, quail, mice, and dogs had shown that the H4 and H6 subtypes could replicate in mice and that some H4 and H6 viruses could replicate in chickens without preadaptation. In addition, two H3 subtype viruses (H3N2 and H3N8) induced interstitial pneumonia that accompanied clinical signs and seroconversion in dogs. Our findings indicate that the newly evolved AIVs have been continuously generated by reassortment in ducks, and these reassortments could result in expanding the host range of AIVs.					7th International Symposium on Avian Influenza7th International Symposium on Avian Influenza	APR 05-08, 2009APR 05-08, 2009		Univ Georgia, Athens, GAUniv Georgia, Athens, GA													WOS:000276455300099	20521725

To investigate the role of r144 during acute infection of neonatal rats, we infected three days-old neonatal rats with either RCMVDeltar144 or wild type (wt) RCMV and the presence of infectious virus as well as viral DNA in various organs was determined at either 3, 5 or 21 days p.i.. In addition, we assessed both type and number of inflammatory cells in these organs. Interestingly, a significantly lower concentration of infectious virus as well as viral DNA was found in spleens of RCMVDeltar144-infected rats than in those of wt RCMV-infected animals at 3 days p.i.. At the same time point, a significantly lower amount of infiltrating NK cells and monocytes/macrophages was seen in the spleens of RCMVDeltar144-infected rats than in spleens of rats infected with wt RCMV. At 21 days p.i., RCMVDeltar144-infected rats were found to have lower virus titers in the salivary glands than wt RCMV-infected animals. Significant differences between RCMVDeltar144- and wt RCMV-infected rats were detected neither at other time points nor at other sites. We conclude that after infection of neonatal rats, the replication of RCMVDeltar144 is severely restricted compared to wt RCMV.																					WOS:000174842300013	12038690

In this chapter we describe clinical observations and experience with VZV disease in the natural human host. We present a refined paradigm for VZV pathogenesis that emphasizes the importance of VZV lymphotropism. We also present key findings in our investigations of VZV pathogenesis and latency using SCID mouse-human tissue xenografts. Experimental infection with over 100 recombinant VZV viruses containing mutations in open reading frames encoding viral glycoproteins, viral kinases, regulatory proteins and as well as promoter elements has revealed tissue-specific requirements for VZV gene motifs and promoter elements for replication in skin, T-lymphocytes and neurons. We have repeatedly observed that replication phenotypes of VZV mutants in cultured cells are not predictive of behaviour within differentiated intact tissues under physiological (in vivo) conditions. These observations underscore the importance of in vivo investigations in identifying molecular mechanisms of VZV pathogenesis. These experiments provide insight into VZV interactions with human host cells and have potential relevance in the design of 'second generation' recombinant VZV vaccines.

STAT-1 Knockout Mice as a Model for Wild-Type Sudan Virus (SUDV)								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	7					1388	10.3390/v13071388				JUL 2021	2021	Currently there is no FDA-licensed vaccine or therapeutic against Sudan ebolavirus (SUDV) infections. The largest ever reported 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak, as well as the 2021 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, highlight the critical need for countermeasures against filovirus infections. A well-characterized small animal model that is susceptible to wild-type filoviruses would greatly add to the screening of antivirals and vaccines. Here, we infected signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 knock out (STAT-1 KO) mice with five different wildtype filoviruses to determine susceptibility. SUDV and Marburg virus (MARV) were the most virulent, and caused 100% or 80% lethality, respectively. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), Bundibugyo ebolavirus (BDBV), and Tai Forest ebolavirus (TAFV) caused 40%, 20%, and no mortality, respectively. Further characterization of SUDV in STAT-1 KO mice demonstrated lethality down to 3.1 x 10(1) pfu. Viral genomic material was detectable in serum as early as 1 to 2 days post-challenge. The onset of viremia was closely followed by significant changes in total white blood cells and proportion of neutrophils and lymphocytes, as well as by an influx of neutrophils in the liver and spleen. Concomitant significant fluctuations in blood glucose, albumin, globulin, and alanine aminotransferase were also noted, altogether consistent with other models of filovirus infection. Finally, favipiravir treatment fully protected STAT-1 KO mice from lethal SUDV challenge, suggesting that this may be an appropriate small animal model to screen anti-SUDV countermeasures.

J	Li, Lin; Ulrich, Reiner; Baumgaertner, Wolfgang; Gerhauser, Ingo								Interferon-stimulated genes-essential antiviral effectors implicated in resistance to Theiler's virus-induced demyelinating disease								JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION				12						242	10.1186/s12974-015-0462-x				DEC 24 2015	2015	Background: Experimental infection of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is used as an animal model of human multiple sclerosis. TMEV persists in susceptible mouse strains and causes a biphasic disease consisting of acute polioencephalomyelitis and chronic demyelinating leukomyelitis. In contrast, resistant mice eliminate the virus within 2 to 4 weeks, which seems to be based on a strong antiviral innate immune response including the activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway. Several interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFN-stimulated protein of 15 kDa (ISG15), protein kinase R (PKR), and 2'5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) function as antiviral effectors and might contribute to virus elimination. Nevertheless, detailed investigations of the type I IFN pathway during TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) are lacking.Methods: The present study evaluated microarray data of the spinal cord obtained from susceptible SJL/J mice after TMEV infection focusing on IFN-related genes. Moreover, ISG gene and protein expression was determined in mock-and TMEV-infected SJL/J mice and compared to its expression in resistant C57BL/6 mice using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence.Results: Interestingly, despite of increased ISG gene expression during TMEV-IDD, ISG protein expression was impaired in SJL/J mice and mainly restricted to demyelinated lesions. In contrast, high ISG protein levels were found in spinal cord gray and white matter of C57BL/6 compared to SJL/J mice in the acute and chronic phase of TMEV-IDD. In both mouse strains, ISG15 was mainly found in astrocytes and endothelial cells, whereas PKR was predominantly expressed by microglia/macrophages, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Only few cells were immunopositive for OAS proteins.Conclusions: High levels of antiviral ISG15 and PKR proteins in the spinal cord of C57BL/6 mice might block virus replication and play an important role in the resistance to TMEV-IDD.

As a rule the virus was present in blood, spleen, brain, intestinal lymph nodes and bone marrow after the first fever peak, whereas in the urine it generally appeared later. The virus was also present in' the c.s.f. of puppies with "catarrhal" distemper, but only in the brain of those with "nervous" distemper was there a constant titre of 1: 1, 000, 000.Ferrets were highly susceptible to intracerebral, intraperitoneal and subcutaneous infection. B. stated that he had carried out 14 passages in mice and 12 in embryonated eggs. In rabbits and rats the virus is stated to survive in the body for a time, but not to multiply.The virus was well preserved by freeze-drying, optimum pH was 7.0. Inactivation of the virus by formol, adsorption on aluminium hydroxide, purification with ether, chloroform, acetone, protamine and by centrifugation were studied.A formolized adsorbate vaccine prepared from brain material of virus-passage puppies, conferred immunity lasting a minium of 3 months when given in 2 doses of 5 ml. each at an interval of 18 days.Some of the author's work contained in this paper has already been published as separate articles [V.B. 22, 3096 & 3713; 23, 114; 24, 1503, 3145 & 3146].There is a very useful bibliography list giving 288 references.-E.G.

CD95 (Fas) and its ligand are important for regulating peripheral T-lymphocyte numbers and can mediate apoptosis of mature T lymphocytes. We infected CD95- and CD95L-deficient mice (lpr and gld, respectively) with LCMV to determine if the immune downregulation that occurred following resolution of the LCMV infection was due to a CD95-dependent apoptotic mechanism. Lymphocytes from LCMV-infected lpr and gld mice were capable of normal T-cell expansion and cytolytic function but were, in contrast to activated cells from normal virus-infected mice, relatively more resistant to T-cell receptor-induced apoptosis in vitro. However, in vivo there were significant numbers of apoptotic cells in the spleens of lpr and gld mice recovering from the infection, and the T-cell number and cytolytic activity decreased to normal postinfection levels. Thus, CD95 is not required for the immune downregulation of the CDS'-T-lymphocyte response following acute LCMV infection.																					WOS:A1996VL79200101	8892953

R			College of Veterinary medicine, China agriculture university						IFI16 functions as an antiviral factor during influenza virus infection by binding viral RNA and enhancing the RIG-I signaling (RNA-seq)								European Nucleotide Archive															2021-01-11	2020	RIG-I is thought to be the most important sensor of influenza virus infection and plays critical roles in the recognition of cytoplasmic dsRNA and activation of type I IFNs and initiates the innate antiviral immune responses. How the binding of viral RNA to and activation of RIG-I are regulated remains enigmatic. Here, by an affinity proteomics approach with viral RNA as the bait, we found that IFI16, previously identified as a DNA sensor, was significantly induced both in vitro and in vivo during influenza virus infection. Using an IFI16 knockout cells and p204-deficient mice model, we demonstrated that IFI16 enhanced RIG-I-mediated production of type I IFNs and thereby inhibited viral replication during influenza virus infection. Furthermore, we showed that IFI16 regulated the RIG-I signaling by enhancing its transcriptional expression through recruitment of RNA Pol II to the RIG-I promoter. We also verified that IFI16 directly interacted with both viral RNA by HINa domain and associated with RIG-I through its PYRIN domain as well as promoted influenza virus-induced K63-linked polyubiquitination of RIG-I. In addition, we found that IFI16 lost its ability to inhibit viral replication in the absence of RIG-I in virus-infected cells. These results indicate that IFI16 is a key regulator of the RIG-I signaling during antiviral innate immune responses, which highlights a novel mechanism of IFI16 in IAV and other RNA viruses infection, expands our knowledge in antiviral innate immunity, and suggests its possible use as a new strategies to manipulate antiviral responses. Overall design: To investigate the endogenous-derived IFI16 in IAV infection, we infected IFI16+/+ and IFI16-/- A549 cells with PR8 virus at an MOI of 1 for 12h. And then, the cells were collected and the total RNA was extracted and analyzed by RNA-seq.																					DRCI:DATA2021013020944914

In vitro and in vivo replication of seal gammaherpesviruses in cells of multiple species								MICROBES AND INFECTION				9	1			40	46		10.1016/j.micinf.2006.10.006				JAN 2007	2007	Phocid herpesvirus virus type 2 (PhHV-2), a putative gammaherpesvirus of seals, has been isolated from harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus). In the present study, different PhHV-2 isolates were shown to have a broad in vitro tropism for various cell types from several mammalian species. Inbred mice and two species of non-human primates proved to be susceptible to experimental infection with PhHV-2. The development of myoepitheliomas and spleen hyperplasia upon cyclosporin A treatment in some of the PhHV-2-infected animals warrants further investigation of the oncogenic and zoonotic potential of this virus.

It is known that IL-33 levels correlate with exacerbation severity, but its role in the immunopathogenesis of exacerbations has remained elusive.Objective: We hypothesized that IL-33 is necessary to drive asthma exacerbations. We intervened with the IL-33 cascade and sought to dissect its role, also in synergy with thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), in airway inflammation, antiviral activity, and lung function. We aimed to unveil the major source of IL-33 in the airways and IL-33-dependent mechanisms that underlie severe asthma exacerbations.Methods: Patients with mild asthma were experimentally infected with rhinovirus. Mice were chronically exposed to house dust mite extract and then infected with influenza to resemble key features of exacerbations in human subjects. Interventions included the anti-IL-33 receptor ST2, anti-TSLP, or both.Results: We identified bronchial ciliated cells and type II alveolar cells as a major local source of IL-33 during virus-driven exacerbation in human subjects and mice, respectively. By blocking ST2, we demonstrated that IL-33 and not TSLP was necessary to drive exacerbations. IL-33 enhanced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation by suppressing innate and adaptive antiviral responses and by instructing epithelial cells and dendritic cells of house dust mite-sensitized mice to dampen IFN-beta expression and prevent the TH1-promoting dendritic cell phenotype. IL-33 also boosted luminal NETosis and halted cytolytic antiviral activities but did not affect the T(H)2 response.Conclusion: Interventions targeting the IL-33/ST2 axis could prove an effective acute short-term therapy for virus-induced asthma exacerbations.

John; Scott, Phillip								Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Expands a Population of NKG2D(+)CD8(+) T Cells That Exacerbates Disease in Mice Coinfected with Leishmania major								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				195	7			3301	3310		10.4049/jimmunol.1500855				OCT 1 2015	2015	Leishmaniasis is a significant neglected tropical disease that is associated with a wide range of clinical presentations and a lifelong persistent infection. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, there is a high risk for coinfection occurring in patients, and how coinfections influence the outcome of leishmaniasis is poorly understood. To address this issue, we infected mice with Leishmania major and 2 wk later with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and then monitored the course of infection. Leishmania parasites are controlled by production of IFN-gamma, which leads to macrophage-mediated parasite killing. Thus, one might predict that coinfection with LCMV, which induces a strong systemic type 1 response, would accelerate disease resolution. However, we found that infection with LCMV led to significantly enhanced disease in L. major-infected animals. This increased disease correlated with an infiltration into the leishmanial lesions of NKG2D(+) CD8(+) T cells producing granzyme B, but surprisingly little IFN-gamma. We found that depletion of CD8 T cells after viral clearance, as well as blockade of NKG2D, reversed the increased pathology seen in coinfected mice. Thus, this work highlights the impact a secondary infection can have on leishmaniasis and demonstrates that even pathogens known to promote a type 1 response may exacerbate leishmanial infections.

Antigens were prepared from oral epithelium of experimentally infected bovines by 3 methods. A 4th antigen preparation consisted of fluid from blisters of infected bovines. The reaction was tried with type-specific guinea pig sera from animals immune and hyper-immune to types O, A and C. In addition, a few bovine sera were tested, these included sera from animals convalescing from an experimental type O infection, and immune or hyperimmune sera from animals vaccinated against types O and A. Plates were prepared by Mansi's method and were read from the 20th to the 72d hour. Readings were usually positive by 48 hrs. Only 2 antigen preparations gave clear cut readings; one consisted of epithelium concentrated with chloroform and acetone (Pyl's method), the other was the vesicle fluid preparation. All reactions were highly specific, and with immune sera the agar precipitation reaction was considerably more sensitive than complement-fixation methods. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: MDS																					BCI:BCI19603500067466

One was capable of producing local graft-vs.-host reactions in syngeneic mice, but incapable of in vitro lysing of noninfected syngeneic target cells. The other subpopulation presents precursors of autoreactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (ACTL) possessing manifest cytolytic activity with respect to the syngeneic noninfected target cells in vitro. To differentiate precursor lymphocytes as mature effectors additional conditions are necessary which are recreated when the precursor lymphocytes are transferred into the body of irradiated syngeneic recipients. T-lymphocyte suppressors are activated in the cell populations of lymph nodes and thymus of mice infected with TBE and Langat viruses. They suppress ACTL production by blocking the differentiation of the precursor cells. The model described may be considered as a demonstration of the defense action of T-suppressors in experimental infections induced by TBE and Langat viruses.

A human hepatocyte transplanted chimeric mouse was used to characterize HBV infectivity in serial stages of acute infection. Chimeric mice were inoculated intravenously with serum samples obtained from an experimentally infected chimpanzee with HBV. Sera from the pre-acute phases (i.e., rump-up viremia prior to anti-HBc) and late acute phases (i.e., declining phase of HBsAg and anti-HBcAb positive) were collected from the chimpanzees 57 and 244 days after inoculation. These sera contained 2.6 x 10(6) and 2.8 x 10(6) copies/ml of HBV DNA, respectively. Three chimeric mice inoculated intravenously with 100 mu l of pre-acute serum (equivalent to 10(0) copy of HBV DNA) developed an HBV infection. The three chimeric mice that received 100 mu l of pre-acute serum (equivalent to 10(1) copies of HBV DNA), developed high levels of serum HBV DNA. None of the three chimeric mice inoculated with 100 mu l of 1:10(4) dilution (equivalent to 10(1) copies of HBV DNA) of late-acute serum was infected, while only one of three chimeric mice inoculated with 100 mu l of 1:10(3) dilution (equivalent to 10(2) copies of HBV DNA) of late-acute serum developed an HBV infection. Based on these results, chimeric mice can be used as animal models for the study of HBV infectivity, pathogenesis and control. The results show that pre-acute phase HBV serum is about 100-times more infectious than late acute phase serum. J. Med. Virol. 80:2064-2068, 2008. (C) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Genetic segregation analysis showed a correlation with disease phenotype in this model with particular V-beta genes. In this study we investigated the contribution of specific V-beta TCR to the pathogenesis of virus-induced demyelinating disease. Spectratype analysis of cells infiltrating the CNS early in infection demonstrated an over-representation of V(beta)8(+) T cells in mice expressing a susceptible H-2 haplotype. We infected transgenic mice expressing the V(beta)8.2 TCR directed against a non-TMEV antigen and found an increase in demyelinating disease in mice of either susceptible or resistant background compared with littermate controls. In addition, depletion studies with an anti-V(beta)8-specific antibody in both susceptible (B10.Q) and resistant (C57BL/6) mice resulted in increased demyelination. TCR analysis of VP2-specific cytotoxic T cell clones from mice with a resistant genotype identified only the V(beta)8.1 TCR, suggesting that limited T cell diversity is critical to TMEV clearance. Together, these results support a protective role for V(beta)8(+) T cells in virus-induced demyelinating disease.																					WOS:000085982000005	10700462

Cell-Intrinsic gp130 Signaling on CD4(+) T Cells Shapes Long-Lasting Antiviral Immunity								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				195	3			1071	1081		10.4049/jimmunol.1402402				AUG 1 2015	2015	The IL-6 cytokine family utilizes the common signal transduction molecule gp130, which can mediate a diverse range of outcomes. To clarify the role of gp130 signaling in vivo during acute viral infection, we infected Cd4-cre Il6st(fl/fl) mice, in which gp130 is conditionally ablated in T cells, with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. We found that by day 12, but not at day 8, after infection the number of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells was reduced in the absence of gp130, and this was sustained for up to 2 mo postinfection. Additionally, gp130-deficient T follicular helper cells had lower expression of Maf, IL-21, and ICOS, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of germinal center B cells and plasmablasts. Remarkably, at 2 mo postinfection the proportion of IgG2a/c(+) memory B cells and the systemic levels of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-specific IgG2 Abs were dramatically decreased, whereas there was a corresponding increase in IgG1(+) memory B cells and virus-specific IgG1 Abs. In the same animals gp130-deficient virus-specific CD8(+) T cells showed a reduced proportion of memory cells, which expressed lower levels of Tcf7, and displayed diminished recall responses on secondary infection. Mixed bone marrow chimeras revealed that the aforementioned gp130 effects on CD4(+) T cells were cell intrinsic. Overall, our data show that gp130 signaling in T cells influences the quantity and quality of long-lasting CD4(+) T cell responses as well as CD8(+) T cell-and Ab-mediated immunity after acute viral infection.

Two pairs of AINO- and AKA-specific primers for nested PCR were synthesized and examined for their capacity to amplify PCR products using 7 Simbu serogroup viruses isolated in Japan and Australia. RT- and nested PCR using AKA-specific primers amplified cDNA from Tinaroo virus RNA as well as homologous RNA. Nested PCR products were differentiated by Hph I and Bst EII digestion. Peaton (PEA) virus S cDNA was also amplified using AINO-specific primers. The nested PCR products of PEA virus were not digested by 3 restriction enzymes (Ava II, Eco RI and Hae II), whereras those of AINO virus were digested as expected. Using this technique, AINO and AKA viruses were detected at concentrations as low as 10(-3) plaque-forming units (PFU) and 10(-5) PFU, respectively, in a supernatant of virus-infected cells. It was possible to detect AINO and AKA genome from various tissues of experimentally infected mice, and also the AKA nested PCR products from serum samples from sentinel cattle naturally infected with AKA virus. The present nested PCR appears a simple, rapid and valuable method for diagnosing AINO and AKA infection.																					WOS:000083915200003	10603165

Further observations on the pathogenesis of rabies in guinea pigs after experimental infection with the Flury strain								ANTONIE VAN LEEUWENHOEK JOUR MICROBIOL AND SEROL				26	(1)			66	72		10.1007/BF02538994				1960	1960	Following inoculation of guinea pigs with the Flury strain of rabies virus in the muscles of the foreleg, the virus could be recovered from the cervico-thoracic cord on the 4th day. From the 6th day on the virus spread in both directions, to the brain and to the lumbosacral cord. There was a close parallelism between the virus distribution and the clinical symptoms: the first signs of paralysis were observed in the inoculated leg. Intravenous inoculation into the vein of the penis resulted in a mortality rate at least as high as that induced by intramuscular injection. The symptoms and the virus distribution demonstrated that the virus first invaded the anterior part of the central nervous system (CNS). From these experiments and others previously reported, we may conclude that after intramuscular inoculation the first segment of the CNS, invaded by the virus, corresponds with the site of inoculation, whereas after intravenous inoculation no such correlation exists. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19603500045002	14405674

The mode of transmission to man is not known, but is thought to be through a tick vector. Monkeys (Cereopithecus patas and Cynocephale) experimentally infected with the shrew virus were made hosts to lice which, after feeding, were transferred to new monkeys (Cynocephale). The latter were not infected but the lice when ground up in citrate or saline and inoculated into fresh monkeys (Cynocephale) were capable of causing a slight infection. The shrew virus causes only a very mild infection in monkeys and mice. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. T. Giltner																					BCI:BCI19300400028241

Domestic animals as reservoirs of the virus are an important factor in the spread of the disease, particularly in areas where they live in close contact with man. I. gives details of histological studies of experimentally-infected rabbits and dogs, as well as details of electrocardio-graphic experiments upon infected g. pigs. A series of experimental inoculations of animals is described in detail. Dogs were found to be most susceptible; rats and g. pigs appeared to be less susceptible. A monkey and a squirrel showed no signs of infection 31 and 20 days respectively after inoculation, while a white rabbit and an armadillo died a few weeks after injection, no trypanosomes being present in the blood before death. Protective inoculation of human beings with Bayer 205 was ineffective. For diagnosis a complement-fixation test is used; an extract of spleen from puppies previously inoculated with heavy doses of Tryp. cruzi serves as the antigen.-J. PASFIELD.

Experimental infection in mice has revealed that the genetically determined natural resistance to murine CMV (MCMV) may be mediated either by direct recognition between the NK receptor Ly49H and the pathogen-encoded glycoprotein m157 or by epistatic interaction between Ly49P and the host MHC H-2D(k). Using stocks of wild-derived inbred mice as a source of genetic diversity, we found that PWK/Pas (PWK) mice were naturally resistant to MCMV. Depletion of NK cells subverted the resistance. Analysis of backcrosses to susceptible BALB/c mice revealed that the phenotype was controlled by a major dominant locus effect linked to the NK gene complex. Haplotype analysis of 41 polymorphic markers in the Ly49h region suggested that PWK mice may share a common ancestral origin with C57BL/6 mice; in the latter, MCMV resistance is dependent on Ly49H-m157 interactions. Nevertheless, PWK mice retained viral resistance against m157-defective mutant MCMV. These results demonstrate the presence of yet another NK cell-dependent viral resistance mechanism, named Cmv4, which most likely encodes for a new NK activating receptor. Identification of Cmv4 will expand our understanding of the specificity of the innate recognition of infection by NK cells.																					WOS:000238768700045	16622016

We developed a competitive quantitative PCR method including specific internal standards to quantify, the expression of BM5d in the spleen of infected mice and to characterize BM5d expression kinetics following experimental infection. Specimen RNA was reverse-transcribed and co-amplified with a competitive template containing a gag sequence specific for BM5d that can be discriminated from that corresponding to wild-type cDNA by the presence of a unique restriction site, Bg/II. PCR products were quantified by means of densitometric analysis after ethidium bromide staining of gels. To standardise the RNA extraction and reverse transcription steps, the amount of defective-virus mRNA was compared to a constant copy number of murine beta acrin mRNA. LP-BM5 production was measured in the spleen of infected mice. Defective gag mRNA production was compared to that of the ecotropic virus. The mRNA level of the defective virus and the titre of replicative virus increased with the duration of infection, and the amount of defective virus mRNA correlated with the titre of replicating virus.

Both ONNV and CHIKV produce similar syndromes with fever, rash, and debilitating arthralgia. To determine the roles of the innate and adaptive immune responses, we infected different knockout mice with two strains of ONNV (SG650 and MP30). Wild-type, RAG1 KO, and IFN gamma R KO mice showed no signs of illness or viremia. The STAT1 KO and A129 mice exhibited 50-55% mortality when infected with SG650. Strain SG650 was more virulent in the STAT1 KO and A129 than MP30. Deficiency in interferon alpha/beta signaling (A129 and STAT1 KO) leaves mice susceptible to lethal disease; whereas a deficiency of interferon gamma signaling alone had no effect on survival. Our findings highlight the importance of type I interferon in protection against ONNV infection, whereas the adaptive immune system is relatively unimportant in the acute infection.

Biological properties of a horse serum inhibitor against influenza A 2 viruses								VIIIth International Congress for Microbiology, Abstracts, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. No. D 30.5								96	p. 96						1962	1962	A glycoprotein containing sialic acid isolated through fractionated precipitation from normal horse serum inhibits hemagglutination by influenza A2 viruses. This thermoactivated factor neutralizes the influenza virus cultivated on chick chorioallan-toic membrane in vitro, in embryonated egg and in the experimental infection of the mice. The inhibitor does not adsorb to chick red cells or to chorioallantoic membrane, and does not neutralize the influenza virus during the intracellular phase. The neutralizing activity both in the embryonated egg and in in vitro culture on chorioallantoic membrane, depends on the concentration of the inhibitor and not on the time of contact between the inhibitor and the virus. Low concentrations of the inhibitor can inhibit the growth of the virus in primary cultures, but a release of virus can be observed after washing and cultivation of chorioallantoic membranes in a fresh medium. Virus obtained from these subcultures is sensitive to the inhibitor. No noticeable elution of virus from the inhibitor is observed, not even a prolonged incubation period. The virus inactivated by the inhibitor does not seem to have any interfering capacity with infectious homologous influenza virus. Therapeutical activity in the experimental infection of mice depends on the concentration of the inhibitor and the timing of treatment. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19634100023446

Infection of other animals could be detrimental by causing clinical disease, allowing further mutations, and bares the risk for the establishment of a non-human reservoir. Cats were the first reported animals susceptible to natural and experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. Given the concerns these findings raised, and the close contact between humans and cats, we aimed to develop a vaccine candidate that could reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection and in addition to prevent spread among cats. Here we report that a Replicon Particle (RP) vaccine based on Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, known to be safe and efficacious in a variety of animal species, could induce neutralizing antibody responses in guinea pigs and cats. The design of the SARS-CoV-2 spike immunogen was critical in developing a strong neutralizing antibody response. Vaccination of cats was able to induce high neutralizing antibody responses, effective also against the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 variant. Interestingly, in contrast to control animals, the infectious virus could not be detected in oropharyngeal or nasal swabs of vaccinated cats after SARS-CoV-2 challenge. Correspondingly, the challenged control cats spread the virus to in-contact cats whereas the vaccinated cats did not transmit the virus. The results show that the RP vaccine induces protective immunity preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. These data suggest that this RP vaccine could be a multi-species vaccine useful to prevent infection and spread to and between animals should that approach be required.

The viruses used were not adapted to mouse organs. In the acute phase of infection, the viral kinetics indicated virus replication in the heart, spleen, thymus, pancreas, and small and large intestines. This was accompanied by histopathological changes, mild infiltration of mononuclear cells and fibrosis in the heart. The necrotic changes with mononuclear infiltration and fibrosis in the myocard was observed on days 56 and 71 p.i. in the CVB4-infected animals only. In the mice infected with CVB3 and CVB4 a prolonged presence of infectious virus was shown in the spleen and small intestine; in the latter viral antigen was localized in smooth muscles of the muscular wall immunohistochemically. This is the first report on prolonged replication of coxsackieviruses (CV) in the spleen and small intestine in orally infected mice.																					WOS:000188855200006	15068380

This innovative idea is so recent that it requires further attention and debate. The significant role played by vimentin in virus-induced infection however is well established: (1) vimentin has been reported as a co-receptor and/or attachment site for SARS-CoV; (2) vimentin is involved in viral replication in cells; (3) vimentin plays a fundamental role in both the viral infection and the consequent explosive immune-inflammatory response and (4) a lower vimentin expression is associated with the inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and fibrosis. Moreover, the absence of vimentin in mice makes them resistant to lung injury. Since vimentin has a twofold role in the disease, not only being involved in the viral infection but also in the associated life-threatening lung inflammation, the use of vimentin-targeted drugs may offer a synergistic advantage as compared with other treatments not targeting vimentin. Consequently, we speculate here that drugs which decrease the expression of vimentin can be used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19 and advise that several Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs be immediately tested in clinical trials against SARS-CoV-2, thus broadening therapeutic options for this type of viral infection.

Mededelingen van den Dienst der Volksgezondheid in Nederlandsch-Indie				19	pt. 3			431	546						1930	1930	This is a detailed account of a study of the factors determining the course of plague epizootics in West Java, in the course of which small mammals were trapped in 87 villages or village-groups. In general only the musk shrew (Crocidura coentlea) and house rats were caught in considerable numbers. Both harboured Xenopsylla cheopis, Roths., which was shown to breed in their nests and pass from one to another, but the rats appeared to be outnumbered by the shrews and almost everywhere the cheopis index of the latter was much higher than that of the former. The index decreased from October 1929 to May 1930, especially on the shrews. There was a distinct correlation between the cheopis indices of the rat and shrew and the monthly numbers of plague cases in the Koeningan district, and the cheopis index of the shrew showed an accurate parallel to the plague mortality rate in the whole area investigated. X. astia, Roths., is equally distributed in small numbers in all villages of Cheribon, but its index figures are always low. A considerable amount of evidence was obtained of the importance of the shrew in relation to the spread of plague. Experiments with marked individuals show that it migrates from village to village, and infection experiments show that it can harbour plague infection for at least 17 days and that fleas on it can remain infective for at least 4 days.

We herein describe the characterization of ORFV infection and disease in rabbits and mice. A protocol of intradermal inoculation was employed to inoculate 10(8.5)TCID(50)/mL of ORFV strain IA-82 in the skin of ears, of the back and labial commissures. All inoculated rabbits presented a clinical course characterized by erythema, macules, papules/vesicles or pustules that eventually dried originating scabs. Local signs started around days 3 and 4 post-inoculation (pi) and lasted 3-10 days. Virus was recovered from lesions between days 2 and 14pi. Histological examination of lesions revealed focal proliferative dermatitis with ballooning degeneration and eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in keratinocytes, histological hallmarks of contagious ecthyma in sheep. A similar, albeit milder clinical course occurred in 5/10 inoculated mice; virus was recovered from lesions from three animals. Inoculated lambs - used as controls - developed severe lesions of contagious ecthyma. VN tests performed at day 28pi failed to detect neutralizing antibodies in all inoculated animals. In contrast, convalescent rabbit sera were positive by ELISA at dilutions from 100 to 400. These results show that rabbits are susceptible to ORFV infection and thus may be used to study selected aspects of ORFV biology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A viral pathogenesis in IPF has been suggested since > 95% of IPF patients have evidence of chronic pulmonary infection with one or more herpesviruses. To determine whether pulmonary infection with herpesvirus can cause lung fibrosis, we infected mice with the murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 ( MHV68). Because IPF patients have a T helper type 2 ( Th2) pulmonary phenotype, we used IFN-gamma R-/-, a strain of mice biased to develop Th2 responses. Chronic MHV68 infection of IFN-gamma R-/- mice resulted in progressive deposition of interstitial collagen as shown by light and electron microscopy. A significant decrease in tidal volume paralleled the collagen deposition. Five features typically seen in IPF, increased transforming growth factor-beta expression, myofibroblast transformation, production of Th2 cytokines, hyperplasia of type II cells, and increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase- 7, were also present in chronically infected IFN-gamma R-/- mice. There also was altered synthesis of surfactant proteins, which is seen in some patients with familial IPF. MHV68 viral protein was found in type II alveolar epithelial cells, especially in lung areas with extensive alveolar remodeling. In summary, chronic herpesvirus pulmonary infection in IFN-gamma R-/- mice causes progressive pulmonary fibrosis and many of the pathological features seen in IPF.

J	Marandu, Thomas F.; Finsterbusch, Katja; Kroeger, Andrea; Cicin-Sain, Luka								Mouse CMV infection delays antibody class switch upon an unrelated virus challenge								EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY				54				101	108		10.1016/j.exger.2014.01.017				JUN 2014	2014	Poor immune protection upon vaccination is a critical determinant of immunosenescence. Latent Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection has been associated with poor antibody responses to vaccination, but a causative role for CMV in the poor immune response requires experimental evidence and thus could not be confirmed in clinical studies. To test the hypothesis that latent CMV infection causes poor antibody responses, we infected young or adult mice with mouse CMV and challenged them with Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) at 15 or 18 months of age. Latent, but not primary infection with mouse CMV resulted in diminished neutralizing titers of the serum IgG fraction at day 7 post challenge, which recovered by day 14 post challenge. This phenomenon was specific for mice infected with mouse CMV, but not mice infected with other herpesviruses, like murine herpesvirus-68 or herpes simplex virus type 1, or mice infected with non-persistent viruses, such as influenza or Vaccinia virus. Hence, our data indicate a delay in IgG class-switch that was specific for the CMV infection. Herpesviral infections did not change the B-cell memory compartment, and increased the size of the effector-memory subset of blood CD4 T-cells only when administered in combination. Furthermore, CD4 T-cell response to VSV infection was maintained in latently infected mice. Therefore, our results argue that latent CMV infection impairs B-cell, but not T-cell responses to a challenge with VSV and delays antibody class-switch by a mechanism which may be independent of T-cell help.

J	Wippold, Jose A.; Wang, Han; Tingling, Joseph; Leibowitz, Julian L.; de Figueiredo, Paul; Han, Arum								PRESCIENT: platform for the rapid evaluation of antibody success using integrated microfluidics enabled technology								LAB ON A CHIP				20	9			1628	1638		10.1039/c9lc01165j				MAY 7 2020	2020	Identifying antibodies (Abs) that neutralize infectious agents is the first step for developing therapeutics, vaccines, and diagnostic tools for these infectious agents. However, current approaches for identifying neutralizing Abs (nAbs) typically rely on dilution-based assays that are costly, inefficient, and only survey a small subset of the entire repertoire. There are also intrinsic biases in many steps of conventional nAb identification processes. More importantly, conventional assays rely on simple Ab-antigen binding assays, which may not result in identifying the most potent nAbs, as the strongest binder may not be the most potent nAb. Droplet microfluidic systems have the capability to overcome such limitations by conducting complex multi-step assays with high reliability, resolution, and throughput in a pico-liter volume water-in-oil emulsion droplet format. Here, we describe the development of PRESCIENT (Platform for the Rapid Evaluation of antibody SucCess using Integrated microfluidics ENabled Technology), a droplet microfluidic system that can enable high-throughput single-cell resolution identification of nAb repertoires elicited in response to viral infection. We demonstrate PRESCIENT's ability to identify Abs that neutralize a model viral agent, Murine coronavirus (murine hepatitis virus), which causes high mortality rates in experimentally infected mice. In-droplet infection of host cells by the virus was first demonstrated, followed by demonstration of in-droplet neutralization by nAbs produced from a single Ab-producing hybridoma cell. Finally, fluorescence intensity analyses of two populations of hybridoma cell lines (nAb-producing and non-nAb-producing hybridoma cell lines) successfully discriminated between the two populations. The presented strategy and platform have the potential to identify and investigate neutralizing activities against a broad range of potential infectious agents for which nAbs have yet to be discovered, significantly advancing the nAb identification process as well as reinvigorating the field of Ab discovery, characterization, and development.

Most of the methods used to determine immunogenic activity are associated with technical difficulties: acquisition, maintenance, immunization, infection and maintenance of infected animals during the entire period of observation, as well as creates a number of inconveniences and errors in the conduct of research. The results of alternative studies of immunogenic activity of live antirabic vaccines for oral immunization of wild carnivores are presented. The technique of immunogenicity evaluation using the model of oral immunization in mice with experimental infection with the CVS rabies control virus at a dose of 10-100 MLD50/0.03 ml is considered. Single administered immunizing dose for white mice weighing 12-14 g was 56.200 MLD50, with henna titers ranging from 1:6 to 1:16 (3.0-4.0 log2) and above. The oral immunizing dose determined by the authors for mice (56200-5620 MLD) correlates with the dose of the virus for wild carnivores (1-2 million MLD), which indicates the efficiency of the laboratory model for determining the immunogenic activity of the oral antirabic vaccine. Determination of the immunogenic activity of the antirabic vaccine on the laboratory model made it possible to choose an immunizing mouse dose of the vaccine that protects 100% of animals in experimental infection with the CVS rabies control virus. Obtained by experimental immunization of mice with henna titers from 1:8 to 1:16 (3,0-4,0 log2) and above, indicate the tense immunity against rabies.			Для каждого вида разрабатываемой вакцины, на животных-мишенях следует определить продолжительность и напряжённость иммунитета, выработанного в результате применения биопрепарата. Большинство применяемых методик определения иммуногенной активности связаны с техническими сложностями: приобретение, содержание, иммунизация, заражение и содержание зараженных животных в течение всего периода наблюдения, а так же создает ряд неудобств и ошибок при проведении исследований. Представлены результаты альтернативных исследований по изучению иммуногенной активности живой антирабической вакцины для пероральной иммунизации диких плотоядных животных. Рассматривается методика оценки иммуногенности с использованием модели оральной иммунизации на мышах при экспериментальном заражении контрольным вирусом бешенства CVS в дозе 10-100 МЛД50/0,03 мл. Однократно вводимая иммунизирующая доза для белых мышей массой 1214 г составила 56.200 MLD50, при этом титры ВНА составили от 1:6 до 1:16 (3,0-4,0 log2) и выше. Определенная нами оральная иммунизирующая доза для мышей (56200-5620 МЛД) коррелирует с дозой вируса для диких плотоядных животных (1-2 млн. МЛД), что свидетельствует об эффективности лабораторной модели определения иммуногенной активности оральной антирабической вакцины. Определение иммуногенной активности антирабической вакцины на лабораторной модели позволило подобрать иммунизирующую мышиную дозу вакцины, которая защищает 100% животных при экспериментальном заражении контрольным вирусом бешенства CVS. Полученные при экспериментальной иммунизации мышей титры ВНА от 1:8 до 1:16 (3,0-4,0 log2) и выше, свидетельствуют о напряженном иммунитете против бешенства.																		RSCI:41859409

However, early viral clearance by IFN-I could limit antigen availability, which could in turn impinge upon the priming of the adaptive immune system. In this study, we hypothesized that transient IFN-I blockade could increase antigen presentation after acute viral infection. To test this hypothesis, we infected mice with viruses coadministered with a single dose of IFN-I receptor-blocking antibody to induce a short-term blockade of the IFN-I pathway. This resulted in a transient "spike" in antigen levels, followed by rapid antigen clearance. Interestingly, short-term IFN-I blockade after coronavirus, flavivirus, rhabdovirus, or arenavirus infection induced a long-lasting enhancement of immunological memory that conferred improved protection upon subsequent reinfections. Short-term IFN-I blockade also improved the efficacy of viral vaccines. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which IFN-I regulate immunological memory and provide insights for rational vaccine design.																					WOS:000599858600001	32820330

The complete genome was sequenced for genetic and phylogenetic analysis. The potential risk of the virus tomammals was evaluated in BALB/c mice. The results showed that the amino acid residues in HA cleavage site is 339 PQIETRGL346, which is consistent with the low pathogenic molecular characteristics. Compared with the amino acid residues in consensussequence of avian influenza viruses, two mutations were found at positions 222 (alanine to valine) and 228 (glycine to serine) ofhemagglutinin (HA) protein, which may affect the receptor-binding properties of the virus. The neuraminidase (NA) protein possessan 11-amino acid deletion in the neck that may affect neuraminidase activity. This virus may be a recombinant of the swine- andavian-origin influenza viruses. The experimental infection in mice showed that the virus could replicate efficiently in the lungwithout prior adaptation, suggesting that the virus has a potential risk to mammals. This study will contribute to understand thebiological characteristic of H6N6 subtype avian influenza virus.																					CABI:20203247184

Because immune responses often play a role, antivirals may not ensure a successful outcome. To identify pathogenic mechanisms and potential adjunctive therapeutic options, we compared the extent to which avian influenza A/H5N1 virus and seasonal influenza A/H1N1 virus impair alveolar fluid clearance and protein permeability in an in vitro model of acute lung injury, defined the role of virus-induced soluble mediators in these injury effects, and demonstrated that the effects are prevented or reduced by bone marrow-derived multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells. We verified the in vivo relevance of these findings in mice experimentally infected with influenza A/H5N1. We found that, in vitro, the alveolar epithelium's protein permeability and fluid clearance were dysregulated by soluble immune mediators released upon infection with avian (A/Hong Kong/483/97, H5N1) but not seasonal (A/Hong Kong/54/98, H1N1) influenza virus. The reduced alveolar fluid transport associated with down-regulation of sodium and chloride transporters was prevented or reduced by co-culture with mesenchymal stromal cells. In vivo, treatment of aged H5N1-infected mice with mesenchymal stromal cells increased their likelihood of survival. We conclude that mesenchymal stromal cells significantly reduce the impairment of alveolar fluid clearance induced by A/H5N1 infection in vitro and prevent or reduce A/H5N1-associated acute lung injury in vivo. This potential adjunctive therapy for severe influenza-induced lung disease warrants rapid clinical investigation.																					WOS:000372876400065	26976597	
J	KONOSH, O. V.								The isolation of the invisible stage of the scarlet fever streptococcus								PROBLEMS VIROLOGY [TRANSL]				2	(2)			102	107						1957	1957	With the aim of establishing the nature of the so-called filterable scarlatinal agents AS and KD of L. I. Fal"kovich et al., a comparison was made of these strains with two laboratory strains of ectromelia virus. In particular, studies were made of the clinical symptoms and the pathological changes in the tissues after experimental inoculation into white mice, and of the pathological changes in inoculated chick embryos and in chorioallantoic membranes. Typical elementary bodies and cytoplasmic inclusions were found in the cells of mouse tissues and in chick embryos. Cross-neutralization tests of the strains with hyperimmune sera were carried out, and also neutralization tests of the strains with sera from children who had had scarlet fever, some of whom had been vaccinated against smallpox- and some who had not. The results of this comparative study established that the AS and KD strains of the so-called "filterable scarlatinal agent" completely resembled biologically, morphologically, and antigenically the virus of infectious ectromelia of mice. The presence of neutralizing antibodies against these strains in some human sera is explained by the influence of earlier vaccination against smallpox, since there is some antigenic similarity between ectromelia and vaccinia viruses. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. concl																					BCI:BCI19583200020434

At present, no therapeutic or vaccine is available for human use. Epidemics of WNV and other emerging infectious disease threats demand cost-efficient and scalable production technologies that can rapidly transfer effective therapeutics into the clinical setting. We have previously reported that Hu-E16, a humanized anti-WNV mAb, binds to a highly conserved epitope on the envelope protein, blocks viral fusion, and shows promising postexposure therapeutic activity. Herein, we generated a plant-derived Hu-E16 mAb that can be rapidly scaled up for commercial production. Plant Hu-E16 was expressed at high levels within 8 days of infiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana plants and retained high-affinity binding and potent neutralizing activity in vitro against WNV. A single dose of plant Hu-E16 protected mice against WNV-induced mortality even 4 days after infection at rates that were indistinguishable from mammalian-cell-produced Hu-E16. This study demonstrates the efficacy of a plant-produced mAb against a potentially lethal infection several days after exposure in an animal challenge model and provides a proof of principle for the development of plant-derived mAbs as therapy against emerging infectious diseases.

We report the construction of the first physiologically based pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PBPK/PD) model that predicts viremia levels in relevant target organs based on preclinical data with the broad spectrum antiviral soraphen A (SorA), an inhibitor of the host cell target acetyl-CoA-carboxylase. SorA was highly effective against DENV in vitro (EC50 = 4.7 nM) and showed in vivo efficacy by inducing a significant reduction of viral load in the spleen and liver of IFNAR(-/-) mice infected with DENV-2. PBPK/PD predictions for SorA matched well with the experimental infection data. Transfer to a human PBPK/PD model for DENV to mimic a clinical scenario predicted a reduction in viremia by more than one log(10) unit for an intravenous infusion regimen of SorA. The PBPK/PD model is applicable to any DENV drug lead and, thus, represents a valuable tool to accelerate and facilitate DENV drug discovery and development.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the purified samples revealed the presence of only one major species of viral protein of about 60 kilodaltons after Coomassie staining. The same band, presumably that of the capsid protein, was detected by western blotting using a mouse hyperimmune serum. This capsid protein was synthesized in MDCK cells as early as 2 hr post-inoculation. Experimental infection of dogs resulted in the production of anti-CaCV antibodies which were detected by microneutralization test and western blotting. Likewise, serosurvey revealed not only the presence of neutralizing antibodies but also reactivity of the field sera against the capsid protein of the purified virus. These results indicate that the capsid protein of CaCV No. 48 strain is immunogenic and could be detected by antibodies in western blotting.																					WOS:A1997WL65500003	9070980

We have previously shown the expression of the ANDV-NSs, but only in infected cell cultures. In this study, we extend our early findings by confirming the expression of the ANDV-NSs protein in the lungs of experimentally infected golden Syrian hamsters. Next, we show, using a virus-free system, that the ANDV-NSs protein antagonizes the type I interferon (IFN) induction pathway by suppressing signals downstream of the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and upstream of TBK1. Consistent with this observation, the ANDV-NSs protein antagonized mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS)-induced IFN-beta, NF-kappa B, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), and IFN-sensitive response element (ISRE) promoter activity. Results demonstrate that ANDV-NSs binds to MAVS in cells without disrupting the MAVS-TBK-1 interaction. However, in the presence of the ANDV-NSs ubiquitination of MAVS is reduced. In summary, this study provides evidence showing that the ANDV-NSs protein acts as an antagonist of the cellular innate immune system by suppressing MAVS downstream signaling by a yet not fully understand mechanism. Our findings reveal new insights into the molecular regulation of the hosts' innate immune response by the Andes orthohantavirus.IMPORTANCE Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV) is endemic in Argentina and Chile and is the primary etiological agent of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in South America. ANDV is distinguished from other hantaviruses by its unique ability to spread from person to person. In a previous report, we identified a novel ANDV protein, ANDV-NSs. Until now, ANDV-NSs had no known function. In this new study, we established that ANDV-NSs acts as an antagonist of cellular innate immunity, the first line of defense against invading pathogens, hindering the cellular antiviral response during infection. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms used by ANDV to establish its infection.																					WOS:000550171000006	32321811

Genetic analysis of the H5N2 viruses isolated from wild birds and domestic ducks demonstrated that they were related to the recently isolated southern Chinese LPAI H5 viruses and various influenza viruses circulating in Eurasia. Three H9N2 viruses obtained at live bird markets and duck farms were reassortant viruses generated from the H5N2 viruses of domestic ducks and the H9N2 virus endemic in Korean chickens. The H5N2 viruses did not replicate well in experimentally infected chickens and mice, but novel H9N2 viruses, without pre-adaptation, were recovered at high titres in chickens. Our results show that reassortment between H5N2 and H9N2 viruses must have occurred in domestic ducks and may have contributed to the diversity expansion of the gene pool, which has potential to alter the pathogenicity and host range of the influenza virus.

Given the importance of type I IFN in the establishment of immunologic memory, we infected BALB/c mice with varying doses of WSN or RSV, and measured levels of IFN-a and IFN-Beta in lung and serum at 24 hour intervals. IFN-Beta was detected in lung homogenates at 24 hours from animals infected with either virus although higher and more prolonged IFN activity was seen following WSN infection. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies demonstrated IFN production by infected respiratory epithelium in both cases. Type I IFN activity could be detected in serum from WSN infected mice at 24 and 48 hours after inoculation, but none was found at any time point in the serum of RSV infected animals. This was true even at the highest achievable RSV dose. To see whether this reflected the ability of DCs to produce type I IFN following exposure to these two viral pathogens, cultures containing both myeloid and plasmacytoid DC subsets were infected and secreted IFNs assayed 24 hours later. In duplicate experiments, on the order of six-fold more IFN-(a+Beta) was produced by WSN versus RSV exposed DCs. We therefore propose that the inability of RSV to stimulate strong DC IFN production may contribute to the lack of effective immunity following natural infection.

The drug notably decreased the mortality in experimental group in comparison with the control. Disease symptoms were less expressed and deaths observed later (7 days vs. 4 in the control) in mice treated with beta-carotene. Histological analysis of the lungs showed smaller foci of lesions. Metaplastic changes in the bronchial epithelium, typical of late terms of infection, were far less expressed in these animals. On the other hand, virus titers decreased negligibly in comparison with the control group. Electron-microscopic study of the effect of beta-carotene on virus population showed that virus replication in chick embryos in the presence of beta-carotene led to an increase in the percentage of filamentous and giant polygenome virus particles. The data indicate that beta-carotene is a promising drug for prevention and treatment of influenza.																					BCI:BCI199900435023	10500983

To conduct complex analytical studies outside of high containment, robust and reliable inactivation methods are needed that maintain compatibility with downstream assays. Here we report the inactivation of WNV in spiked serum samples using a commercially available SDS-PAGE sample buffer for proteomic studies. Using this method, we demonstrate its utility by identification proteins differentially expressed in the serum of mice experimentally infected with WNV.

Experimental findings in mouse infection								JAP JOUR EXP MED				13	(3)			331	339						1935	1935	Portions of human lymph gland from 4 typical cases were emulsified in 5 volumes of saline, and .02-.03 cc. of the emulsion were inoculated into the mouse brain. Passages, brain to brain, were carried through 24 mice, with positive findings in all. The clinical manifestations were loss of appetite and weight, weakness, diarrhea, tremor, collapse, and in some instances paralysis. Autopsy revealed hyperemia of the meninges and an increase in spinal fluid. Intra-cerebral inoculation of monkeys with mouse brain emulsion infects as does material from human tissue. Mice can be infected with the virus by the intratesticular route as well as through the nervous system, and such tissues reveal granular corpuscular bodies believed to be the virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: M.

Genetic and Pharmacologic Alteration of Cathepsin Expression Influences Reovirus Pathogenesis								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				83	19			9630	9640		10.1128/JVI.01095-09				OCT 2009	2009	The cathepsin family of endosomal proteases is required for proteolytic processing of several viruses during entry into host cells. Mammalian reoviruses utilize cathepsins B (Ctsb), L (Ctsl), and S (Ctss) for disassembly of the virus outer capsid and activation of the membrane penetration machinery. To determine whether cathepsins contribute to reovirus tropism, spread, and disease outcome, we infected 3-day-old wild-type (wt), Ctsb(-/-), Ctsl(-/-), and Ctss(-/-) mice with the virulent reovirus strain T3SA+. The survival rate of Ctsb(-/-) mice was enhanced in comparison to that of wt mice, whereas the survival rates of Ctsl(-/-) and Ctss(-/-) mice were diminished. Peak titers at sites of secondary replication in all strains of cathepsin-deficient mice were lower than those in wt mice. Clearance of the virus was delayed in Ctsl(-/-) and Ctss(-/-) mice in comparison to the levels for wt and Ctsb(-/-) mice, consistent with a defect in cell-mediated immunity in mice lacking cathepsin L or S. Cathepsin expression was dispensable for establishment of viremia, but cathepsin L was required for maximal reovirus growth in the brain. Treatment of wt mice with an inhibitor of cathepsin L led to amelioration of reovirus infection. Collectively, these data indicate that cathepsins B, L, and S influence reovirus pathogenesis and suggest that pharmacologic modulation of cathepsin activity diminishes reovirus disease severity.

In this study, we used squirrel monkeys (Saimiri collinsi), a neotropical primate (which mimics the stages of human pregnancy), as a model of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Seven pregnant female squirrel monkeys were experimentally infected at three different gestational stages, and we were able reproduce a broad range of clinical manifestations of ZIKV lesions observed in newborn humans. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of early-infected newborns (2/4) revealed damage to various areas of the brain and ZIKV antigens in the cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells, indicative of CZS. The changes caused by ZIKV infection were intrauterine developmental delay, ventriculomegaly, simplified brain gyri, vascular impairment and neuroprogenitor cell dysfunction. Our data show that the ZIKV infection outcome in squirrel monkeys is similar to that in humans, indicating that this model can be used to help answer questions about the effect of ZIKV infection on neuroembryonic development and the morphological changes induced by CZS.

We aimed to investigate whether the detection of lipocalin 2, a protein of the acute innate immunity response, may be used as a marker for acute bacterial meningitis.Methods: Transgenic mice expressing the human transferrin were infected by intraperitoneal route and were imaged. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sampled up to 48hours post-infection to measure lipocalin 2. We also tested a collection of 90 and 44 human CSF with confirmed acute bacterial or acute viral meningitis respectively.Results: Lipocalin 2 was detected after 5 h in CSF during experimental infection in mice. Lipocalin 2 levels were significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in patients with confirmed acute bacterial meningitis (mean 125 pg/mL, range 106-145 pg/mL) than in patients with acute viral meningitis (mean 2 pg/mL, range 0-6 pg/mL) with a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 71% in diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis.Conclusions: Increased levels of lipocalin 2 in cerebrospinal fluid may discriminate between acute bacterial and viral meningitis in patients with clinical syndrome of meningitis.

To determine whether the virus has this capacity. we infected an atherosclerotic-prone mouse strain (C57BL/6J apoE-/-) with murine CMV. At 14 days of age, 30 mice received CMV (30 000 pfu) ip and 30 received virus free media. At 13 and 16 weeks atherosclerotic lesion size was measured from aortic sinus cross-sections. Infection did not alter plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and high density lipoprotein (HDL), however, 4 weeks after infection IFN gamma levels were elevated (infection vs control: 156 +/- 49 vs 50 +/- 22 pg/ml, P = 0.04). No differences in lesion size were present at 13 weeks post infection. However. by 16 weeks mean aortic sinus lesion area (mm(2) x 10(3) +/- SEM; N = 75) in the CMV-infected mice was significantly greater than in uninfected mice (74 +/- 6 vs 57 +/- 6, P = 0.04). CMV caused the greatest increase (34%) in lesion size in females (103 +/- 9 vs 77 +/- 10; P = 0.05, N = 35). These results provide additional evidence implicating CMV as a causal agent of atherosclerosis, at least in an animal model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				36	12			922	929						2014	2014	To study the biological characteristics of a H8N4 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV), the AIV A/duck/HuN/S3160/2012(H8N4) was isolated from duck in a live poultry market in Hunan and subjected to sequencing analysis and animal pathogenic tests. The sequencing results showed that the isolate had a HA cleavage site of 339PSIEPK GLF347, which was a characteristic structure of low pathogenic AIV and the PB1 and NS genes were highly homologous to A/spot-billed duck/Xianghai/427/2011 (H5N2) and A/wild bird/Korea/A81/2009(H5N2) respectively; the rest of the internal genes were highly homologous to H2, H3, H4, H7 and H10 subtypes of AIV. In addition, the pathogenic test showed that the virus has the ability to efficient replication in ducks and resulted in shedding through the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, but it was unable to replicate in chickens. Moreover, virus was also restricted replication in lung and nasal shall in the experimentally infected BALB/c mice, indicating the isolate was a low-pathogenic virus.

Lethal tumor dose which could kill 50% of rats (LTD50) was increased up to 1000 times by immunization with the viable xenogenized tumor cells. A procedure for augmenting immunogenicity of the xenogenized tumor cells was examined. Intradermal single immunization with the xenogenized tumor cells (3rd passage generation through Friend virus-tolerant rats) most strongly inhibited the s.c. growth of non-xenogenized tumor; LTD50 was markedly increased > 10,000 times. Intradermal active immunization with the viable xenogenized tumor cells followed by the irradiated non-xenogenized tumor cells resulted in 30.8% complete regression of the s.c. transplanted tumor.

Four hybridoma clones were secreting mAbs that bound to a 100 kDa protein, presumably the hexon protein. These mAbs were found to cross-react with two other Indian isolates of EDS virus and to the reference UK 127 strain. Three of these mAbs were mapped to the same epitope compared with the other mAb (F8), which bound to a different epitope. An antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (AC-ELISA) was developed using the F8 mAbs as capture antibody and polyclonal chicken serum against EDS virus as detection antibody. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect the EDS viral genome. Following experimental infection of oestrogen-treated chickens with EDS virus, cloacal swabs, oviduct, uterus and spleen were collected at different days post-infection and used in both AC-ELISA and PCR, directly and after a single passage in embryonated duck eggs. The sensitivity and specificity of antigen detection by AC-ELISA or PCR was 95% and 98%, respectively. For diagnosis of EDS viral infections, PCR is recommended due to its ease and the lack of requirement of prepared reagents such as mAbs or conjugates. We recommend that PCR be performed directly on boiled tissue homogenates. Any negative samples may be passaged in embryonated duck eggs and the allantoic fluids tested by PCR before a conclusive negative diagnosis is given.

While the strains commonly circulating in humans usually do not cause severe pathogenicity in healthy adults, some strains that have infected humans, such as H5N1, can cause high morbidity and mortality. Based on the severity of the disease, influenza viruses are sometimes categorized as either being highly pathogenic (HP) or having low pathogenicity (LP). The reasons why some strains are LP and others HP are not fully understood. While there are likely multiple mechanisms of interaction between the virus and the immune response that determine LP versus HP outcomes, we focus here on one component, namely macrophages (MP). There is some evidence that MP may both help fight the infection and become productively infected with HP influenza viruses. We developed mathematical models for influenza infections which explicitly included the dynamics and action of MP. We fit these models to viral load and macrophage count data from experimental infections of mice with LP and HP strains. Our results suggest that MP may not only help fight an influenza infection but may contribute to virus production in infections with HP viruses. We also explored the impact of combination therapies with antivirals and anti-inflammatory drugs on HP infections. Our study suggests a possible mechanism of MP in determining HP versus LP outcomes, and how different interventions might affect infection dynamics.																					WOS:000371274400135	26918620

Experimental Inoculation of Artibeus jamaicensis Bats with Dengue Virus Serotypes 1 or 4 Showed No Evidence of Sustained Replication								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				91	6			1227	1234		10.4269/ajtmh.14-0361				DEC 2014	2014	Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease to humans. Bats are potential reservoirs for flaviviruses, including dengue virus (DENV). In this work, Artibeus jamaicensis bats were inoculated with two serotypes of DENV using different routes. For experimental inoculations (El) 1 and 2, bats were inoculated subcutaneously or intraperitoneally with DENV-4; for EI-3 bats were inoculated intraperitoneally with DENV-1. Mock inoculated bats were kept as controls. In EI-4, bats were bitten by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with DENV-1 or 4. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays in plasma and spleen tissue collected from Day 1 to Days 9-17 after inoculation failed to reveal the presence of viral RNA in any of the samples. No evidence of circulating NS1 or specific anti-DENV IgG was detected in the plasma of the inoculated bats. These results indicate that A. jamaicensis bats are incapable of sustaining dengue virus replication and are unlikely to act as reservoirs for this virus.

Society for Neuroscience Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner				2002				Abstract No. 403.12	Abstract No. 403.12						2002	2002	The use of viruses, especially various pseudorabies virus (PRV) strains as circuit-specific neuronal tracers, is becoming a common tool for neuroanatomical studies. Particularly useful for highlighting multiple-synapse systems, these viruses are also being used for double-label experiments in the pursuit of common origins for divergent projections. A major caveat for their use in double-label experiments, however, is the incidence of viral interference, in which one virus prevents the co-infection of a cell by another. To elucidate a temporal window in which 100% co-infection is possible, we infected both dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and porcine-kidney-15 (PK-15) cells with two isogenic strains of PRV Bartha expressing different reporter proteins with varying delays between infections: PRV 152, expressing EGFP; PRV BaBlu, expressing beta-galactosidase; and PRV 613, expressing DsRed2; with delays between infection of 0, 6, 9, 12, and 18 hours. We found that there is approximately a 6-hour window of time in which two isogenic strains of PRV Bartha can infect the same cell. A similar viral interference study was conducted in vivo in the Syrian hamster examining retrograde transsynaptic transport following intraocular anterior chamber injection of virus. A similar 6-hour window of permissive co-infection was observed.					32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience	November 02-07, 2002November 02-07, 2002	Society for NeuroscienceSociety for Neuroscience	Orlando, Florida, USAOrlando, Florida, USA													BCI:BCI200300303706

The association of S. haematobium infection and bladder cancer is well known and documented. However, S. japonicum infection has also been reported to be associated with cancer, in this case hepatocellular carcinoma and/or colorectal cancer. Pathological records and analyses have shown a correlation between this infection and cancer, and pathohistological descriptions have been numerous, together with clinical case reports. Epidemiological analyses have been conducted in China and Japan and support a role of S. japonicum infection as one of the risk factors in cancer formation, along with others, such as hepatitis virus infection and alcoholic intake. Experimental results have also shown that cancer appears early and in larger numbers in experimentally infected animals given a known carcinogen. In spite of these positive end-point associations, the mechanism of schistosome-mediated enhancement of carcinogenesis is obscure. A suggestive observation is that in S. japonicum-infected mice carcinogen-metabolizing hepatic activity including P-450 was decreased so that an administered carcinogen persisted for a longer period than in uninfected mice. Further studies, both epidemiological and experimental, are needed to firmly establish the relationship between schisotosome infection and cancer.																					WOS:A1994NB67700020	7510038

Literature has shown that MHV-3 infection induces immunologic disorders characterized by thymic involution with marked cell depletion. However, the effects of interactions between MHV-3 and the parasite on the immune system are not well understood, In the present study specific-pathogen-free CBA mice were inoculated with MHV-3, alone or associated with different stocks of T. cruzi, Concurrent murine virus infection resulted in increased pathogenicity of T. cruzi infection shown by profound thymic atrophy; loss of cortical thymocytes; depletion of Thy1.2(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) cells; enhancement of in situ labeling of nuclear DNA fragmentation; and eventually, death of the animals, Such lines of evidence show that the mechanism underlying this thymic atrophy is associated with apoptosis, These results also suggest that MHV-3 can account for the increased immunosuppression observed during experimental infection with the parasite.

J	Scott, Courtney A.; Rossiter, John P.; Andrew, R. David; Jackson, Alan C.								Structural abnormalities in neurons are sufficient to explain the clinical disease and fatal outcome of experimental rabies in yellow fluorescent protein-expressing transgenic mice								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				82	1			513	521		10.1128/JVI.01677-07				JAN 2008	2008	Under natural conditions and in some experimental models, rabies virus infection of the central nervous system causes relatively mild histopathological changes, without prominent evidence of neuronal death despite its lethality. In this study, the effects of rabies virus infection on the structure of neurons were investigated with experimentally infected transgenic mice expressing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) in neuronal subpopulations. Six-week-old mice were inoculated in the hind-limb footpad with the CVS strain of fixed virus or were mock infected with vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline). Brain regions were subsequently examined by light, epifluorescent, and electron microscopy. In moribund CVS-infected mice, histopathological changes were minimal in paraffin-embedded tissue sections, although mild inflammatory changes were present. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling and caspase-3 immunostaining showed only a few apoptotic cells in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Silver staining demonstrated the preservation of cytoskeletal integrity in the cerebral cortex. However, fluorescence microscopy revealed marked beading and fragmentation of the dendrites and axons of layer V pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar mossy fibers, and axons in brainstem tracts. At an earlier time point, when mice displayed hind-limb paralysis, beading was observed in a few axons in the cerebellar commissure. Toluidine blue-stained resin-embedded sections from moribund YFP-expressing animals revealed vacuoles within the perikarya and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These vacuoles corresponded with swollen mitochondria under electron microscopy. Vacuolation was also observed ultrastructurally in axons and in presynaptic nerve endings. We conclude that the observed structural changes are sufficient to explain the severe clinical disease with a fatal outcome in this experimental model of rabies.

Lungs were collected from mock-infected controls or at day 1,2,3,4 post infection. Expression data were obtained from three independent experiments. We infected a highly susceptible mouse strain (D2) and a resistant strain (B6) with PR8 and performed a genome-wide expression analysis. We found genes expressed in lung epithelium that were specifically down-regulated in D2 mice, whereas a cluster of genes on chromosome 3 was only down-regulated in B6. In both mouse strains, chemokines, cytokines and interferon-response genes were up-regulated, indicating that the main innate immune defense pathways were activated. However, many immune response genes were up-regulated in D2 much stronger than in B6, and several immune response genes were exclusively regulated in D2. Thus, susceptible D2 mice showed a hyper-inflammatory response. This response is similar to infections with highly pathogenic influenza virus and may serve as a paradigm for a hyper-inflammatory host response to influenza A virus.

J	Trujillo, Jonathan A.; Fleming, Erica L.; Perlman, Stanley								Transgenic CCL2 Expression in the Central Nervous System Results in a Dysregulated Immune Response and Enhanced Lethality after Coronavirus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	5			2376	2389		10.1128/JVI.03089-12				MAR 2013	2013	Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), a chemoattractant for macrophages, T cells, and cells expressing CCR2, is upregulated during acute and chronic inflammation. CCL2 has been implicated in both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses and has been suggested as a target for therapy in some inflammatory disorders. To examine the role of CCL2 during virus infection, we infected mice transgenically expressing CCL2 in the central nervous system (CCL2 Tg) with an attenuated neurotropic coronavirus (rJ2.2 strain of mouse hepatitis virus). Infection of wild-type mice with rJ2.2 results in mild acute encephalitis, followed by a nonlethal, chronic demyelinating disease. Proinflammatory innate and adaptive immune responses mediate virus clearance. In marked contrast, CCL2 Tg mice infected with rJ2.2 ineffectively cleared virus and rapidly succumbed to the infection. CCL2 Tg mice mounted a dysregulated immune response, characterized by augmented accumulation of regulatory Foxp3(+)CD4(+) T cells and of nitric-oxide- and YM-1-expressing macrophages and microglia, suggestive of mixed M1/M2 macrophage activation. Further, macrophages from infected CCL2 Tg brains relative to non-Tg controls were less activated/mature, expressing lower levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II), CD86, and CD40. Collectively, these results show that persistent CCL2 overexpression establishes and sustains an immunological milieu that is both inflammatory and immunosuppressive and predisposes mice to a defective immune response to a minimally lethal virus.

Histologic Lesions Induced by Murine Norovirus Infection in Laboratory Mice								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				53	4			754	763		10.1177/0300985815618439				JUL 2016	2016	Murine noroviruses (MNVs) are highly prevalent in laboratory mice, can cause persistent infections, and have been shown to infect macrophages, dendritic cells, and B cells. To address the potential impact of MNV infection on research outcomes, numerous studies have been conducted with various mouse models of human disease and have generated mixed results, ranging from no impact to significant disease. Many of these studies included histologic evaluations after MNV infection, and these results have similarly been variable in terms of whether MNV induces lesions, despite the fact that localization of MNV by viral culture and molecular techniques have demonstrated systemic distribution regardless of mouse immune status. The aim of this review is to summarize the histologic findings that have been reported with MNV infection in several mouse models. The studies demonstrate that experimental infection of MNV in wild-type mice results in minimal to no histologic changes. In contrast, immunodeficient mice consistently have detectable MNV-induced lesions that are typically inflammatory and, in the most severe cases, accompanied by necrosis. In these, the liver is commonly affected, with more variable lesions reported in the lung, gastrointestinal tract, mesenteric lymph nodes, brain, and spleen. In specific disease models including atherosclerosis, MNV infection had a variable impact that was dependent on the mouse model, viral strain, timing of infection, or other experimental variables. It is important to recognize the reported MNV lesions to help discern the possible influence of MNV infection on data generated in mouse models.																					WOS:000378711700007	26792844

The Dengue virus non-structural protein 3 (NS3) is known to possess ATPase, helicase, and protease activities that are a constitutive part of the replication complex of Dengue virus. In this report, we discuss the cloning, expressing, and purifying of the Dengue-2 NS3 protein, to immunize mice and then generate monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Our results show the production of MAbs specific to NS3 protein of Dengue-2 virus, which by immunofluorescence recognize the native protein in experimentally infected endothelial cells (HMEC). Likewise, C6/36-infected lisates were used in Western blots, and observed the specific characteristic band that defines the NS3 protein. We conclude that these antibodies may be a useful tool, not only to study the replicative process of Dengue virus, but also to generate specific diagnostic tools for Dengue infection.

Its 152-kb genome is organized in two covalently linked segments, each composed of a unique sequence flanked by inverted repeats. Replication of the HSV-1 genome produces concatemeric molecules in which homologous recombination events occur between the inverted repeats. This mechanism leads to four genome isomers (termed P, IS, IL, and ILS) that differ in the relative orientations of their unique fragments. Molecular combing analysis was performed on DNA extracted from viral particles and BSR, Vero, COS-7, and Neuro-2a cells infected with either strain SC16 or KOS of HSV-1, as well as from tissues of experimentally infected mice. Using fluorescence hybridization, isomers were repeatedly detected and distinguished and were accompanied by a large proportion of noncanonical forms (40%). In both cell and viral-particle extracts, the distributions of the four isomers were statistically equivalent, except for strain KOS grown in Vero and Neuro-2a cells, in which P and IS isomers were significantly overrepresented. In infected cell extracts, concatemeric molecules as long as 10 genome equivalents were detected, among which, strikingly, the isomer distributions were equivalent, suggesting that any such imbalance may occur during encapsidation. In vivo, for strain KOS-infected trigeminal ganglia, an unbalanced distribution distinct from the one in vitro was observed, along with a considerable proportion of noncanonical assortment.

Here we demonstrate that this effect is also observed with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection and resulted in a deficiency of both splenic transitional B cells and mature follicular B cells. To determine whether there was an associated impairment of humoral immunity, we infected mice with LCMV and 10 days later at the peak of the B cell depletion, inoculated them with influenza virus. We found that influenza virus-specific antibody titers were dramatically reduced in mice recovering from LCMV infection compared to those in mice infected with influenza virus alone. Further, we showed that there was no reduction of the influenza virus-specific antibody response in LCMV-infected TNF-alpha/LTalpha-deficient mice, suggesting that TNF-alpha/LTalpha-mediated effects on bone marrow and/or peripheral lymphocytes were responsible for the observed impairment in humoral immunity. These results show that the TNF-alpha/LTalpha production induced following infection with diverse viruses has detrimental effects on early B cells in the bone marrow, and may be among the factors that lead to the severely compromised humoral immunity observed to subsequent heterologous infections.

Intra-peritoneal injection was generally used, but intramuscular, subcutaneous and oral routes were also employed. The newborn were not permitted to ingest colostrum, and where necessary were fed cows milk heated for 15 minutes. Observations were made on rabbits, guinea pigs, pigs, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, horses and cattle. In all species the 3 types of virus demonstrated pathogenic action, creating a clinical picture characterized by a progressive thermal curve, locomotor disturbance of a paraplegic type, respiratory difficulty and digestive upset. Death occurred between 30 and 60 hours postinfection. In all cases the virus had a predilection for heart tissue. In the course of the investigation no modification of type specificity was observed. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: S. B. Hitchner																					BCI:BCI19573100005206

Although natural infections of humans with EIV have not been reported, experimental inoculation of humans with these viruses can lead to a productive infection and elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Moreover, EIV have crossed the species barrier to infect dogs, pigs, and camels and therefore may also pose a threat to humans. Based on serologic cross-reactivity of H3N8 EIV from different lineages and sublineages, A/equine/Georgia/1/1981 (eq/GA/81) was selected to produce a live attenuated candidate vaccine by reverse genetics with the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the eq/GA/81 wild-type (wt) virus and the six internal protein genes of the cold-adapted (ca) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (H2N2) vaccine donor virus, which is the backbone of the licensed seasonal live attenuated influenza vaccine. In both mice and ferrets, intranasal administration of a single dose of the eq/GA/81 ca vaccine virus induced neutralizing antibodies and conferred complete protection from homologous wt virus challenge in the upper respiratory tract. One dose of the eq/GA/81 ca vaccine also induced neutralizing antibodies and conferred complete protection in mice and nearly complete protection in ferrets upon heterologous challenge with the H3N8 (eq/Newmarket/03) wt virus. These data support further evaluation of the eq/GA/81 ca vaccine in humans for use in the event of transmission of an equine H3N8 influenza virus to humans.IMPORTANCEEquine influenza viruses have crossed the species barrier to infect other mammals such as dogs, pigs, and camels and therefore may also pose a threat to humans. We believe that it is important to develop vaccines against equine influenza viruses in the event that an EIV evolves, adapts, and spreads in humans, causing disease. We generated a live attenuated H3N8 vaccine candidate and demonstrated that the vaccine was immunogenic and protected mice and ferrets against homologous and heterologous EIV.

The results indicated that all cats infected with T. gondii had antibody responses to antigens of T. gondii in both aqueous fluids and CSF. Co-infection with FIV did not affect antibody levels. Aqueous fluids from eyes of cats with toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis did not necessarily have higher antibody levels than those from eyes without lesions. Antibodies to T. gondii were also detected in the CSF of two cats from whose brains no parasites were isolated by in vivo mouse inoculation. Total IgG did not increase significantly in the aqueous fluids and CSF of cats infected with T. gondii whether or not they were also infected with FIV.

Investigations into the relatedness of various heterologous GBR strains have been hindered by the difficulty of growing these viruses in cell culture. Viral RNA extracted from experimentally infected rats was used to prepare cDNA clones. From these, the nucleotide sequences of genes 9 and 11 of the IDIR strain of GBR were determined and compared with the corresponding sequences of the human ADRV strain of GBR. IDIR gene 11 is 643 bp in length with a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding 174 amino acids; IDIR gene 9 is 804 bp in length with a single ORF encoding 246 amino acids. Comparison of the IDIR sequences with those of ADRV showed that nucleotide sequence similarity was 60.6% and 71.9% for genes 9 and 11, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence similarity was 51.2% for the gene 9 and 66.5% for the gene 11 product. This sequence diversity indicates that GBRs are more distantly related than strains of group A rotavirus.																					WOS:A1991GP52100028	1658208

In the beginning of 2004, HPAI outbreaks were caused by H5N1 virus in two farms and a group of pet chickens in different areas of Japan. In the present study, the pathogenicity of A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (H5N1), which had been isolated from a dead chicken during the first outbreak in Japan, was assessed in chickens, quails, budgerigars, ducklings, mice, and miniature pigs by experimental infection. The virus was highly pathogenic to all the birds tested. Mice were susceptible to infection with a low mortality rate and miniature pigs were resistant to infection with the virus.																					WOS:000238530800003	16502281

Bulletin of the National Institute of Animal Health					108			23	32						2001	2001	Bovine mammillitis has been sporadically observed among cattle in Japan. Since parapoxvirus (PPV) and bovine herpesvirus type 2 (BHV-2) were suspected as agents of the diseases, specific and sensitive methods for diagnosis of these diseases were studied. Seroepidemiological surveys were performed on PPV by agar gel immunodiffusion test and ELISA using protein AG, and on BHV-2 by virus neutralization tests. Serum samples were collected from cattle in various parts of Japan. Positive reactors to PPV were found all over Japan and the rate of positive reactors was more than 70%. On the other hand, reactors to BHV-2 were found sporadically and their positive rate was about 1%. Positive reactors to PPV were observed in Japanese serow, suggesting that PPV is transmitted between domestic and wild animals. Genetical diagnosis methods by PCR were developed for the detection of PPV and BHV-2, and their practical use was evaluated. Semi-nested PCR was applied to the diagnosis of PPV infection and it was able to detect viral DNA from lesions of clinically affected animals in the fields. The reaction was effective for all PPV strains and these were divided into 4 groups by restriction fragment length polymorphism. Shuttle PCR was developed for diagnosis of BHV-2 infection and the specificity and sensitivity of the reaction were confirmed by digestion with restriction endonuclease AulI and by using homogenized muscle and skin of mice experimentally infected with BHV-2.

Given that interleukin 16 (IL16) can regulate T cell function and is one of the signature markers for virus infection including IAV infection, the impact of IL16 on IAV-induced T cell immune response hasn't been elucidated yet. In this paper, we infected wild type and IL16 knockout (KO) mice with IAV and analyzed the immunity of mice by flow cytometry. We observed an increase in the percentage of T helper (Th) 1 cells in the spleens of IL 16 KO mice and elevation of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secretion from CD8(+) T cells in the lungs and spleens of IL16 KO mice in response to IAV infection. Moreover, the expression of major histocompatibility complex II which represents the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) was upregulated in the lungs of IL16 KO mice. Taken together, our study suggests that IL16 deficiency enhanced Th1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte response as well as DC maturation upon IAV infection, which provides new insight into the host regulation of T cell immune responses during IAV infection.

Higher NT antibody titers were consistently obtained by addition of 20% guinea pig fresh serum to virus-serum mixtures in NT tests. Furthermore, the complement-requiring NT antibody titer increased in many serum samples when the virus-serum mixtures, rather than being incubated at 37 degrees C for 60 min, were incubated first at 4 degrees C for 48 hr and then with a complement at 37 degrees C for 60 min. The slow-reacting and complement-requiring NT antibody was detected as early as 8 days post-inoculation. It was detected in sera collected at 8 to 28 days post-inoculation and was sensitive to 2-mercaptoethanol treatment. Sera collected at 35 to 44 days post-inoculation contained 2-mercaptoethanol resistant NT antibodies. These results indicate that the modified NT test is useful for early serodiagnosis of PRRS virus infection through detection of higher NT antibody titers, and in detecting them earlier.

I								JOUR EXP MED				51	(6)			847	858		10.1084/jem.51.6.847				1930	1930	Filtration exps. indicated that the virus is not filterable in the ordinary sense. The particles are probably smaller than bacteria; filtration results suggest that its magnitude is consistent with the tunica bodies observed by Mooser. Negative filtrates failed to immunize. The virus is present in blood plasma, hardly if at all in leucocytes, and becomes closely associated with the erythrocytes, though it seems not to be contained in them. It becomes firmly associated with normal red cells when they are exposed to infectious plasma. In tissue culture, tunica material with Mooser bodies remains alive and virulent for [plus or minus] 10 days. Within glass capsules in the peritoneum of guinea pigs, the virus may remain alive for about the same time as in tissue cultures. Rough comparative virulence estimations between blood plasma, in which it would be hardly possible to find a limited number of Mooser bodies (even if present), and tunica material showed the plasma to be less infectious than the tunica material, in which considerable numbers of Mooser bodies were visible. The testicular swelling characteristic of Mexican typhus, and showing Mooser bodies[long dash]probably Rickettsia, may be absent in individual guinea pigs under ordinary conditions and when inoculated by other than the intra-peritoneal route. On re-inoculation into the peritoneum after non-orchitic passages, the swelling reappears. Whenever it did not so reappear, the strain had either degenerated in virulence or had been contaminated by intercurrent infection. It is believed that the tunica lesion is an integral part of this disease in guinea pigs. Convalescent blood from Mexican-typhus guinea pigs, mixed in the test-tube with virus, affords protection if the blood is taken between the 1st and 10th days after defervescence. After the 3rd wk., the blood no longer contains protective bodies, although the guinea pigs may still be immune. In 1 case, a serum was obtained, which was protective in such a test, but at the same time seemed still to contain virus. No complement-fixing antibodies were found when virus serum was used as antigen and convalescent serum as antibody, possibly due to the low concentration of virus in the serum. 2 guinea pigs negatively inoculated with virus-serum mixtures proved on re-inoculation to be immune. In one of these cases the protective serum-virus mixture was taken 1 day, in the other, 5 days, after temp. had returned to normal; and re-inoculations were done 36 and 40 days, respectively, after primary injection. In a number of exps., active immunization with formolized tunica material containing large numbers of Mooser bodies seems to have modified the course of subsequent inoculations toward protection. A single accidental human infection seemed particularly associated with tunica material. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From authors' summary																					BCI:BCI19340800008942	19869731

Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 Pathogenesis Is Independent of Caspase-1 and Caspase-11 in Mice and Impairs Interleukin-1 beta Production upon Extrinsic Stimulation in Culture								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	13			6562	6574		10.1128/JVI.00658-15				JUL 2015	2015	Gammaherpesviruses establish lifelong infections that are associated with the development of cancer. These viruses subvert many aspects of the innate and adaptive immune response of the host. The inflammasome, a macromolecular protein complex that controls inflammatory responses to intracellular danger signals generated by pathogens, is both activated and subverted during human gammaherpesvirus infection in culture. The impact of the inflammasome response on gammaherpesvirus replication and latency in vivo is not known. Caspase-1 is the inflammasome effector protease that cleaves the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-18. We infected caspase-1-deficient mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) and observed no impact on acute replication in the lung or latency and reactivation from latency in the spleen. This led us to examine the effect of viral infection on inflammasome responses in bone marrow-derived macrophages. We determined that infection of macrophages with MHV68 led to a robust interferon response but failed to activate caspase-1 or induce the secretion of IL-1 beta. In addition, MHV68 infection led to a reduction in IL-1 beta production after extrinsic lipopolysaccharide stimulation or upon coinfection with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Interestingly, this impairment occurred at the proIL-1 beta transcript level and was independent of the RTA, the viral lytic replication and transcription activator. Taken together, MHV68 impairs the inflammasome response by inhibiting IL-1 beta production during the initial stages of infection.IMPORTANCEGammaherpesviruses persist for the lifetime of the host. To accomplish this, they must evade recognition and clearance by the immune system. The inflammasome consists of proteins that detect foreign molecules in the cell and respond by secreting proinflammatory signaling proteins that recruit immune cells to clear the infection. Unexpectedly, we found that murine gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis was not enhanced in mice lacking caspase-1, a critical inflammasome component. This led us to investigate whether the virus actively impairs the inflammasome response. We found that the inflammasome was not activated upon macrophage cell infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68. Infection also prevented the host cell inflammasome response to other pathogen-associated molecular patterns, indicated by reduced production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta upon bacterial coinfection. Taken together, murine gammaherpesvirus impairment of the inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta in macrophages identifies one mechanism by which the virus may inhibit caspase-1-dependent immune responses in the infected animal.

J	ABE K								THE EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION OF COXSACKIE B3 VIRUS IN SUCKLING MICE								Journal of the Iwate Medical Association				42	5			673	688						1990	1990	Virological and pathological studies on infection of Coxsackie virus B 3 (CVB 3: Nancy strain) in suckling mice were performed. Twelve to 24 hours old suckling mice were inoculated. They were sacrificed 5 days after inoculation and each organ was examined. CVB 3 was isolated from the brain, heart, liver, small intestine and the other organs by cell culture. The infectious titer in the brain and liver were slightly higher than the other organs. Necrosis of bilateral hippocampus with minimal infiltration, mild degeneration with inflammatory infiltration of myocardial fiber and perivascular edema in the heart, moderate karyolysis and karyorrhexsis of liver cell nuclei were histologically observed. Some crystalline arraies (virus particles) were observed in hippocampus by electron microscopic study. Specific antigen of CVB3 was observed at the perinuclear region in liver cells and the hippocampus by indirect immunofluorescence test. These results indicate that CVB3 has special sensitivity to the brain, the heart and the livr of suckling mice. The brain presented localized necrosis. Viral hepatitis was caused by CVB3 by direct infection of the liver cells. It has been said that the heart muscle is sensitive to CVB3, but our experiments revealed that the heart damage was mild in spite of the fact that CVB 3 was isolated.

Paradoxically, neurons are classically regarded as MHC-I deficient. However, it is shown here that H2-encoded heavy chains (alpha Cs) and their associated light chain, beta 2 microglobulin, are present on the surfaces of primary sensory neurons recovered from sensory ganglia within 1 to 2 weeks of HSV infection. During this time, some neurons are found to be tightly associated with T cells in vivo. Prior data showed that termination of productive HSV infection in the peripheral nervous system is not dependent on cell-mediated lysis of infected neurons. Consistent with these data, immunogold electron microscopy showed that the density of cell surface H2 on neurons is an order of magnitude lower than on satellite glia, which is predicted to favor a noncytolytic CD8 cell response.

Bulletin of the World Health Organization				20				579	88						1959	1959	Staining with fluorescent antibody of street rabies antigens in smears made from the salivary glands of rabid animals is described.The salivary glands of 157 animals, including dogs, foxes, cats, pigs, cows, one squirrel and one rat were processed with fluorescent antibody. In addition, staining was carried out for Negri bodies and virus isolation studies were made on the brains and salivary glands. By virus isolation from the brains, a total of 55 animals were found to be rabid. Of these, 51 were shown to have demonstrable Negri bodies and 49 were found to excrete virus in the salivary gland. Forty-eight of these 49 were found to have antigens in the salivary glands which could be stained by fluorescent antibody techniques and demonstrated by microscopic examination of smears made from six different areas of the glands.

J	Lorenzo, Gema; Lopez-Gil, Elena; Warimwe, George M.; Brun, Alejandro								Understanding Rift Valley fever: Contributions of animal models to disease characterization and control								MOLECULAR IMMUNOLOGY				66	1	SI		78	88		10.1016/j.molimm.2015.02.001				JUL 2015	2015	Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis with devastating health impacts in domestic ruminants and humans. Effective vaccines and accurate disease diagnostic tools are key components in the control of RVF. Animal models reproducing infection with RVF virus are of upmost importance in the development of these disease control tools. Rodent infection models are currently used in the initial steps of vaccine development and for the study of virus induced pathology. Translation of data obtained in these animal models to target species (ruminants and humans) is highly desirable but does not always occur. Small ruminants and non-human primates have been used for pathogenesis and transmission studies, and for testing the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutic antiviral compounds. However, the molecular mechanisms of the immune response elicited by RVF virus infection or vaccination are still poorly understood. The paucity of data in this area offers opportunities for new research activities and programs. This review summarizes our current understanding with respect to immunity and pathogenesis of RVF in animal models with a particular emphasis on small ruminants and non-human primates, including recent experimental infection data in sheep.

To determine the in vivo function of the CNC protein Nrf3 (NF-E2-related factor 3), we generated mice deficient in this transcription factor. We performed targeted disruption of two Nrf3 exons coding for CNC homology, basic DNA-binding, and leucine zipper dimerization domains. Nrf3 null mice developed normally and revealed no obvious phenotypic differences compared to wild-type animals. Nrf3(-/-) mice were fertile, and gross anatomy as well as behavior appeared normal. The mice showed normal age progression and did not show any apparent additional phenotype during their life span. We observed no differences in various blood parameters and chemistry values. We infected wild-type and Nrf(-/-) mice with acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and found no differences in these animals with respect to their number of virus-specific CD8 and CD4 T cells as well as their B-lymphocyte response. To determine whether the mild phenotype of Nrf3 null animals is due to functional redundancy, we generated mice deficient in multiple CNC factors. Contrary to our expectations, an absence of Nrf3 does not seem to cause additional lethality in compound Nrf3(-/-)/Nrf2(-/-) and Nrf3(-/-)/p45(-/-) mice. We hypothesize that the role of Nrf3 in vivo may become apparent only after appropriate challenge to the mice.																					WOS:000220685400021	15060151

Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus) were infected intraperitoneally and intranasally with monkeypox virus (MPXV). A fulminant illness developed in all animals, and they died 6-9 days after infection. Virus was cultured from the blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, all of the organs tested contained relatively high titers of MPXV. The major pathologic findings were in the liver, which showed centrilobular necrosis, steatosis, and basophilic inclusion bodies in hepatocytes. Splenic necrosis was also observed, as well as interstitial inflammation in the lungs. The pathologic features of MPXV in ground squirrels are similar to that described with MPXV in macaques and severe variola (smallpox) virus infection in humans.

Experimental infection by Helicobacter hepaticus in mice causes chronic hepatitis and HCC and recently, more Helicobacter species (Helicobacter spp.) have been detected in the liver of patients suffering from cholestatic diseases and HCC arising from non-cirrhotic liver. We investigated whether Helicobacter spp. sequences could be detected in the liver of patients with cirrhosis and HCC compared to subjects with metastasis to liver from colon cancer.METHODS: Twenty-three liver samples from patients operated upon for HCC superimposed on hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related cirrhosis and 6 from patients with resected metastases from colorectal cancer, were tested by polymerase chain reaction for presence of genomic 16S rRNA of Helicobacter genus using specific primers. DNA sequencing and cag A gene analysis were also performed.RESULTS: Genomic sequences of Helicobacter spp. were found in 17 of 20 (85%) liver samples from patients with HCC and in 2 of 6 samples from patients with liver metastasis. In three samples of the first group the result was uncertain. H pylori was revealed in 16 out of 17 positive samples and Helicobacter pullorum in the other.CONCLUSION: Helicobacter spp., carcinogenic in mice, were found at a higher frequency in the liver of patients with HCV-related cirrhosis and HCC than those in patients without primary liver disease.

Methods for detecting Zika virus in feces: A case study in captive squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis)								PLOS ONE				13	12					e0209391	10.1371/journal.pone.0209391				DEC 20 2018	2018	A strain of Zika virus (ZIKV) of Asian origin associated with birth defects and neurological disorders has emerged and spread through the Americas. ZIKV was first isolated in the blood of nonhuman primates in Africa and has been detected in the blood, saliva, and urine of a few catarrhine species in both Africa and Asia, suggesting that nonhuman primates may serve as both a source and a reservoir of the virus. The recent introduction of ZIKV to human populations in the Americas presents the potential for the virus to spread into nonhuman primate reservoirs. Thus, it is critical to develop efficient and noninvasive detection methods to monitor the spread of the virus in wild nonhuman primate populations. Here, we describe a method for ZIKV detection in noninvasively collected fecal samples of a Neotropical primate. Fecal samples were collected from two captive squirrel monkeys (Saimiri boliviensis boliviensis) that were experimentally infected with ZIKV (Strain Mexico_1_44) and an additional two uninfected squirrel monkeys. Nucleic acids were extracted from these samples, and RT-qPCR was used to assay for the presence of ZIKV using primers flanking a 101 bp region of the NS5 gene. In both ZIKV-inoculated animals, ZIKV was detected 5-11 days post-infection, but was not detected in the uninfected animals. We compare the fecal results to ZIKV detection in serum, saliva, and urine samples from the same individuals. Our results indicate that fecal detection is a cost-effective, noninvasive method for monitoring wild populations of Neotropical primates as possible ZIKV reservoirs.

In infected cells, the ORF3 causes the accumulation of p53 by interacting with pPirh2 and possibly by disrupting the association of p53 and pPirh2 (J.Virol.81(2007)9560). Mutant PCV2 lacking the expression of ORF3 are infectious and replicate in cells in vitro, but do not cause apoptosis of the infected cells. The ORF3 of PCV2 has been shown to be involved in pathogenesis of the virus in mice model (J. Virol. 80(2006)5065). Here we report the experimental inoculation of ORF3 deficient PCV2 in its natural host, the piglets. The pathogenicity of the ORF3 deficient virus is attenuated in the piglets. The mutant virus did not cause any observable disease or perturbation of the lymphocyte count in the inoculated piglets and elicited an efficient immune response. When compared with the wildtype virus infection, the mutant virus infection was characterized by mild viremia and absence of pathological lesions. The findings highlight the role of ORF3 in the pathogenesis of PCV2 infection in its host. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000262605700019	19012942

We screened viruses with NA substitutions previously found during OS and ZAN selection in avian influenza viruses (AIVs) of the N3 to N9 subtypes for LAN susceptibility. Of the 72 NA substitutions, 19 conferred resistance to LAN, which ranged from 11.2to 549.8-fold-decreased inhibitory activity over that of their parental viruses. Ten NA substitutions reduced the susceptibility to all four NAIs, whereas the remaining 26 substitutions yielded susceptibility to one or more NAIs. To determine whether the in vitro susceptibility of multi-NAI-resistant AIVs is associated with in vivo susceptibility, we infected BALB/c mice with recombinant AIVs with R292K (ma81K-N3(R292K)) or Q136K (ma81K-N8(Q136K)) NA substitutions, which impart in vitro susceptibility only to LAN or OS, respectively. Both ma81KN3(R292K) and ma81K-N8(Q136K) virus-infected mice exhibited reduced weight loss, mortality, and lung viral titers when treated with their susceptible NAIs, confirming the in vitro susceptibility of these substitutions. Together, LAN resistance profiling of AIVs of a range of NA subtypes improves the understanding of NAI resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, the association of in vitro and in vivo NAI susceptibility indicates that our models are useful tools for monitoring NAI susceptibility of AIVs.IMPORTANCE The chemical structures of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) possess similarities, but slight differences can result in variable susceptibility of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) carrying resistance-associated NA substitutions. Therefore, comprehensive susceptibility profiling of these substitutions in AIVs is critical for understanding the mechanism of antiviral resistance. In this study, we profiled resistance to the anti-influenza drug laninamivir in AIVs with substitutions known to impart resistance to other NAIs. We found 10 substitutions that conferred resistance to all four NAIs tested. On the other hand, we found that the remaining 26 NA substitutions were susceptible to at least one or more NAIs and showed for a small selection that in vitro data predicted in vivo behavior. Therefore, our findings highlight the usefulness of screening resistance markers in NA enzyme inhibition assays and animal models of AIV infections.																					WOS:000601305100009	33055248

Gan Gan and Trubanaman viruses almost perfectly matched 2 recently isolated, purportedly novel viruses, Salt Ash and Murrumbidgee viruses, respectively. Kowanyama and Yacaaba viruses were identified as being related to members of a large clade containing pathogenic viruses. Taggert virus was confirmed as being a nairovirus; several viruses of this genus are pathogenic to humans. The genetic relationships and historical experimental infections in mice reveal the potential for these viruses to lead to disease emergence.																					WOS:000374726100009	27088588

Its possible usefulness was based on recent successful investigations on the diagnosis of the closely related pestiviruses, bovine virus diarrhoea or border disease virus. In contrast to these viruses, the diagnostic methods for CSFV require maximum sensitivities and specificities because of the consequences of a diagnosis on the actions taken by the animal health service. Also, in the face of an outbreak the number of samples to be examined increase dramatically, and therefore diagnostic methods which can be automated are required. The specificity of FACS was as expected and suitable. With respect to the sensitivity, further assays with CSFV isolates of low virulence need to be evaluated. Automated analytical devices and replacement of centrifugation steps could enhance the ability to process large numbers of samples. Useful tools such as filter plates and paramagnetic particles have been established and are commercially available for human diagnostic systems. The reduction in the time to produce a result to approximately half a day together with the power to eliminate non-specific reactions make this an attractive methode.

Taiwan Journal of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Husbandry					28			1	14						1976	1976	Guinea-pigs at 20 or 30 days gestation received i/v injections of Smedi-A porcine enterovirus; controls were injected with sterile culture fluid. Gestation was terminated by hysterectomy at two, three, four or five weeks after injection and the guinea-pigs were killed for viral examination. It seemed that the placenta was the only organ infected by virus, and endometritis, placentitis and placental necrosis were the only lesions. The virus caused lesions and death of about 15% of the fetuses within 2 weeks of infection.																					CABI:19772281558

Bedbugs can be infected by allowing them to feed on benzolized rats in whose blood Rickettsias have been shown to be present. Injection of the organs of such bedbugs 5 days after the last, and 9 days after the 1st, infectious feeding into guinea pigs produced typical Mexican typhus. Some of the guinea pigs infected with such organs, and passing through a typical typhus, proved to be immune to subsequent inoculation with the European form. Attempts to infect normal guinea pigs by allowing infected bedbugs to feed on them or by rubbing the feces into the uninjured skin have thus far been unsuccessful. The cycle proving that bedbugs can transmit the disease has not been completed, but it is a possibility when dealing with man, obviously more susceptible to the disease than any of these experimental animals. The ease with which the Rickettsias seem to survive in bedbugs suggests the desirability of investigating other common insects for a similar capacity of harboring typhus Rickettsias. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors' summary																					BCI:BCI19340800009033	19869795

Studies of Tensaw virus in Anopheles quadrimaculatus, A. albimanus and A. maculatus								MOSQUITO NEWS				27	(1)			1	5						1967	1967	A. quadrimaculatus, A. albimanus and A. maculatus mosquitoes were infected with Tensaw virus using the membrane feeding technique. Higher mean titers were seen in A. quadrimaculatus than in the other 2 mosquitoes and there appeared to be little or no relationship between the amount of virus ingested by this species and the resultant virus titers. Very low quantities of virus were sufficient to produce infection in the A. quadrimaculatus and A. albimanus mosquitoes, and infection thresholds were similar for these 2 species. Transmission of Tensaw virus was obtained by the feeding of A. quadrimaculatus and A. albimanus on suckling mice after 12 to 14 days of extrinsic incuEation. The amount of virus initially ingested did not appear to affect the transmission rate. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19684900090678		
R	Rapp, Emily; Tsoukas, Paul; Canna, Scott								Interleukin-18 and cytotoxic impairment are independent and synergistic causes virus-induced hyperinflammation in mice								Gene Expression Omnibus															2021-02-18	2020	To determine the effects of excess Il-18 on virus-induced immunopathology, we infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice with lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (lCMV, Armstrong). lCMV infection is self-limited in wild-type (WT) mice, but Prf1-/- mice develop prolonged viremia and fatal HlH. lCMV-infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice developed cachexia and hyperinflammation comparable to Prf1-/- mice, albeit with minimal mortality. We use RnA-sequencing to identify differences in the transcriptome of GP33 - specific CD8 T cells from these mice in comparison to a wild type mouse under the same conditions. We saw expression of Ifng was elevated about 4-fold in both Prf1-/- and Il18tg mice. Genes specifically upregulated in Il18tg CD8 T-cells included Csf2, Il1rl1, and Il12rb2. We also saw differences between Prf1-/- and WT/Il18tg CD8 T-cells that included Klrg1 and transcripts associated with CD8 T-cell exhaustion, including the inhibitory receptors lag3, Havcr2, and Tigit, and the transcription factors Tox and Prdm1. These data support that Il-18 as a potent, independent, and modifiable driver of life-threatening innate and adaptive hyperinflammation, and support the rationale for an Il-18-driven subclass of hyperinflammation.

Pathogenesis of Neonatal Herpes Simplex 2 Disease in a Mouse Model Is Dependent on Entry Receptor Expression and Route of Inoculation								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	1			474	481		10.1128/JVI.01849-12				JAN 2013	2013	Herpes simplex virus (HSV) pathogenesis in mice differs based on availability of the principal entry receptors herpesvirus entry mediator (HVEM) and nectin-1 in a manner dependent upon route of inoculation. After intravaginal or intracranial inoculation of adult mice, nectin-1 is a major mediator of neurologic disease, while the absence of either receptor attenuates disease after ocular infection. We tested the importance of receptor availability and route of infection on disease in mouse models of neonatal HSV. We infected 7-day-old mice lacking neither or one principal HSV receptor or both principal HSV receptors with HSV-2 via a peripheral route (intranasal), via a systemic route (intraperitoneal), or by inoculation directly into the central nervous system (intracranial). Mortality, neurologic disease, and visceral dissemination of virus were significantly attenuated in nectin-1 knockout mice compared with HVEM knockout or wild-type mice after intranasal inoculation. Mice lacking both entry receptors (double-knockout mice) showed no evidence of disease after inoculation by any route. Nectin-1 knockout mice had delayed mortality after intraperitoneal inoculation relative to wild-type and HVEM knockout mice, but virus was able to spread to the brain and viscera in all genotypes except double-knockout mice. Unlike in adult mice, HVEM was sufficient to mediate disease in neonatal mice after direct intracranial inoculation, and the absence of HVEM delayed time to mortality relative to that of wild-type mice. Additionally, in wild-type neonatal mice inoculated intracranially, HSV antigen did not primarily colocalize with NeuN-positive neurons. Our results suggest that differences in receptor expression between adults and newborns may partially explain differences in susceptibility to HSV-2.

The CD8+ T cell response to Theiler's virus requires antigen presentation by a hematopoietic antigen presenting cell but not migration of naive T cells to peripheral lymph nodes.								Abstracts of the General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology				103				E	113						2003	2003	Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) causes a demyelinating disease in the central nervous system (CNS) of susceptible mice that resembles multiple sclerosis in humans. The early stages of infection with TMEV are characterized by a massive infiltration of lymphocytes. Inflammation is resolved in resistant mice that clear the virus, whereas it is persistent in susceptible mice with chronic virus infection. Understanding how and where lymphocytes get activated and proliferate is important in identifying targets for therapy of immune-mediated demyelinating disease. We sought to determine the cellular and site-specific requirements for CD8+ T cell activation upon Theiler's virus infection in the brain. Specifically, we asked whether the brain is the site of activation and expansion of virus-specific lymphocytes. In order to determine the nature of the antigen presenting cell (APC) required for T cell activation, we performed bone marrow transplants from susceptible mice into resistant hosts and vice versa. It was found that the APC required for T cell activation is not a brain parenchymal cell, but a cell of hematopoietic origin. To identify the lymphoid organ required for T cell activation, we infected resistant lymphotoxin alpha knockout mice that lack peripheral lymphoid organs, or resistant mice that have been splenectomized. We found that the neither the spleen or the lymph nodes are required for the migration of virus-specific CD8+ T cells to the brain. These observations suggest that activation of virus-specific T cells may occur in the brain through interactions with a brain-resident APC of hematopoietic origin.					103rd American Society for Microbiology General Meeting103rd American Society for Microbiology General Meeting	May 18-22, 2003May 18-22, 2003	American Society for MicrobiologyAmerican Society for Microbiology	Washington, DC, USAWashington, DC, USA													BCI:BCI200300533515

While E5 is present in high-risk mucosotropic HPVs that cause anogenital and head and neck cancers, it is absent in cutaneous HPVs and the recently discovered mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1), which causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin and mucosal epithelia in laboratory mice. We infected K14E5 transgenic mice, which express the high-risk mucosotropic HPV16 E5 gene in stratified epithelia, with MmuPV1 to investigate the effects of E5 on papillomavirus-induced pathogenesis. Skin lesions in MmuPV1-infected K14E5 mice had earlier onset, higher incidence, and reduced frequency of spontaneous regression compared to those in non-transgenic mice. K14E5 mice were also more susceptible to cervicovaginal cancers when infected with MmuPV1 and treated with estrogen compared to non-transgenic mice. Our studies support the hypothesis that E5 contributes to papillomavirus-induced pathogenesis.																					WOS:000514219400001	31826841

The body weights and levels of antibody against PCV2 were examined. The increase in body weight of the control was significantly higher than those in Groups S and M, and the increase in body weight of Group S was significantly higher than Group M. Viral replication was detected in Groups S and M, but not detected in the control. The specific antibody against PCV2 were observed in Groups S and M. The level of antibody in Group M was significantly higher than Group S. No anti-PCV2 antibody was detected in the control. The pathological lesions were observed in Groups S and M. The lymph nodes of the mice in Groups S and M were affected by PCV2. It is suggested that mice can be experimentally infected with PCV2.																					CABI:20083189186

This result was compatible with that of phylogenetic analysis, which showed that trees of the eight genes were composed of two or three minor branch clusters. The PB2, PA, NP and M proteins of human H5N1 viruses were further characterized by the presence of previously reported amino acid sequences peculiar to those of human strains. The virulence of A/Hong Kong/483/97 (HK483) in mice exhibited a sharp contrast to that of AA-long Kong/156/97 (HK156). Virulence of the former even remained after constant repeated passage in eggs, while the latter rapidly decreased in virulence for mice after only a few passages in eggs. It became apparent that Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell-grown virus (HK156-CK) and its clones derived from mouse brain produced a fatal infection in mice through intranasal (i.n.) or intracerebral (i.e.) routes. Conversely, the pathogenicity shown by the egg-derived parental virus (HK156-E3) and its clones were considerably lower in mice after i.n. or i.e. infection. A series of experimental infections revealed that the marked differences in neurovirulence among viruses could be attributed to whether or not viruses were transmitted from the lung to the brain. In amino acid sequence comparison of the entire proteins, it was suggested that a total of six amino acid differences in the PB1 (residues 456 and 712), PA (residue 631), HA (residue 211), NP (residue 127) and NS1 (residue 101) proteins related closely to changes in pathogenicity or neurovirulence of the HK156 virus in mice, As a result, it was evident that less pathogenic and neurovirulent strains appeared through adaptation and selection of variants during passage in eggs.

Immunogenicity in mice and rabbits of DNA vaccines expressing woodchuck hepatitis virus antigens								VACCINE				26	32			4025	4033		10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.05.021				JUL 29 2008	2008	The licensed vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an effective means to prevent infection, but is not an effective therapeutic strategy to treat established chronic infections when used alone. In an animal model of chronic HBV infection (the woodchuck experimentally infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV)), the combination of conventional vaccine and potent antiviral drugs has shown Promise as a potential therapeutic intervention. This approach might be improved further through the application of newer vaccine technologies. In the present study, we evaluated electroporation (EP)-based intramuscular (i.m.) delivery of a codon-optimized DNA vaccine for the WHV Surface antigen (WHsAg) in mice and rabbits. In mice, this immunization procedure compared favorably to vaccination by i.m. injection of the DNA vaccine or i.m. administration of a recombinant WHsAg-alum vaccine, exhibiting characteristics expected to be beneficial for a therapeutic vaccine strategy. These included dose efficiency, consistency, vigorous induction of antibody responses to WHsAg, as well as a Th1 bias. Following scale-up to rabbits, a species that approximates the size of the woodchuck, the EP dosing regimen was markedly more effective than conventional i.m. injection of the DNA vaccine. Taken together, these results provide the foundation for studies of EP-based DNA immunization in the woodchuck in order to further assess its potential as an immunotherapeutic approach for treatment of chronic HBV infection in humans.

R	Kelvin, David J								Interferon response genes as immunopathogenic correlates of SARS coronavirus infection in mice (129/S6/SvEv)								European Nucleotide Archive															2015-06-18	2014	To further identify and understand the molecular and immunological correlates of pathology for SARS-CoV infection, we infected 129/S6/SvEv or B129 mice with the TOR2 strain of SARS-CoV. SARS-CoV was detected in the lung and nasal turbinates of infected mice peaking at 1 day post infection (DPI) in both tissues before decreasing rapidly to levels below detection at 7 DPI and 3 DPI, respectively. Pulmonary lesions in virus-infected animals included bronchiolar, peribronchiolar, and perivascular foci of mild to moderate subacute inflammation. Chronic inflammation included inflammatory macrophages, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Neutralizing antibodies appeared on 5 DPI (IgM); converting to IgG on 7 DPI. Despite the prevailing notion that SARS-CoV interferes with the induction of interferon (IFN) signaling, mice infected with SARS-CoV in vivo demonstrated significantly increased expression of innate antiviral interferon (IFN) response genes (IRGs) in the lungs during the first week of acute infection. By the end of the second week of infection, coordinated expression of MHC class I / II and antigen presentation genes occurred in correlation with declining viral titres. Collectively, the mouse data suggests that robust IFN-driven innate immune responses and a critical shift from innate to adaptive immune responses is necessary for clearance and recovery from SARS-CoV infection. Keywords: time course Overall design: In this study, we present the characterization of a 4- to 6-week old mouse (129/S6/SvEv) model for SARS-CoV (TOR-2) in conjunction with a functional genomics analysis of the lungs. The study design is a time course (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 14, 28 days post-infection) examination of the natural history and IFN-mediated host responses in SARS-CoV-infected mice. Three mice are included at each time point for a total of 21 datasets.

VZV reactivation from latency in sensory nerve ganglia is a direct consequence of VZV neurotropism. Investigation of VZV neuropathogenesis by infection of human dorsal root ganglion xenografts in immunocompromised (SCID) mice has provided a novel system in which to examine VZV neurotropism. Experimental infection with recombinant VZV mutants with targeted deletions or mutations of specific genes or regulatory elements provides an opportunity to assess gene candidates that may mediate neurotropism and neurovirulence. The SCID mouse human DRG xenograft model may aid in the development of clinical strategies in the management of herpes zoster as well as in the development of "second generation" neuroattenuated vaccines.

Western blotting analysis revealed that three mAbs (1145, IE10, and 11-17) recognized specifically to a single protein of 47 kDa (N), the mAb 3G4 reacted with, two SVCV0504 proteins of 69 kDa (G) and 47 kDa (N), while the mAb 1A9 reacted with three SVCV0504 proteins of 69 kDa (G), 50 kDa (P), and 47 kDa (N). By indirect ELISA, two mAbs (1H5 and 11-17) showed cross-reactivity with pike fry rhabdovirus (PFRV), but no cross-reactions with the Siniperca chuatsi rhabdovirus (SCRV), Scophthalmus maximus rhabdovirus (SMRV), Paralichthys olivaceus rhabdovirus (PoRV) were demonstrated with the five mAbs. Indirect immunofluorescence showed intense fluorescence in the cytoplasm of the SVCV0504-infected epithelioma papulosum cyprini (EPC) cells in areas corresponding to the location of granular structures. The sucrose gradient-purified SVCV0504 particles could be detected successfully by these mAbs using immunodot blotting. mAb 1A9 could completely neutralize 100 TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) of SVCV0504 at a dilution of 1:8. This is the first report of development of the neutralizing mAbs against SVCV. The mAb 1A9 was analyzed further and could be used to successfully detect viral antigens in the infected-EPC cell cultures or in cryosections from experimentally infected crucian carp (Carassius auratus) by immunohistochemistry assay. Furthermore, a flow cytometry procedure for the detection and quantification of cytoplasmic SVCV0504 in cell cultures was developed with mAb 1A9. At 28 h after inoculation with the virus (0.01 PFU/cell), 10.12% of infected cells could be distinguished from the uninfected cells. These mAbs will be useful in diagnostic test development and pathogenesis studies for fish rhabdovirus. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000256747800011	18378003

J	Wei, Tao; Grace, Miranda; Uberoi, Aayushi; Romero-Masters, James C.; Lee, Denis; Lambert, Paul F.; Munger, Karl								The Mus musculus Papillomavirus Type 1 E7 Protein Binds to the Retinoblastoma Tumor Suppressor: Implications for Viral Pathogenesis								MBIO				12	4					e02277-21	10.1128/mBio.02277-21				JUL-AUG 2021	2021	The species specificity of papillomaviruses has been a significant roadblock for performing in vivo pathogenesis studies in common model organisms. The Mus musculus papillomavirus type 1 (MmuPV1) causes cutaneous papillomas that can progress to squamous cell carcinomas in laboratory mice. The papillomavirus E6 and E7 genes encode proteins that establish and maintain a cellular milieu that allows for viral genome synthesis and viral progeny synthesis in growth-arrested, terminally differentiated keratinocytes. The E6 and E7 proteins provide this activity by binding to and functionally reprogramming key cellular regulatory proteins. The MmuPV1 E7 protein lacks the canonical LXCXE motif that mediates the binding of multiple viral oncoproteins to the cellular retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein, RB1. Our proteomic experiments, however, revealed that MmuPV1 E7 still interacts with RB1. We show that MmuPV1 E7 interacts through its C terminus with the C-terminal domain of RB1. Binding of MmuPV1 E7 to RB1 did not cause significant activation of E2F-regulated cellular genes. MmuPV1 E7 expression was shown to be essential for papilloma formation. Experimental infection of mice with MmuPV1 expressing an E7 mutant that is defective for binding to RB1 caused delayed onset, lower incidence, and smaller sizes of papillomas. Our results demonstrate that the MmuPV1 E7 gene is essential and that targeting noncanonical activities of RB1, which are independent of RB1's ability to modulate the expression of E2F-regulated genes, contribute to papillomavirus-mediated pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Papillomavirus infections cause a variety of epithelial hyperplastic lesions, or warts. While most warts are benign, some papillomaviruses cause lesions that can progress to squamous cell carcinomas, and approximately 5% of all human cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. The papillomavirus E6 and E7 proteins are thought to function to reprogram host epithelial cells to enable viral genome replication in terminally differentiated, normally growth-arrested cells. E6 and E7 lack enzymatic activities and function by interacting and functionally altering host cell regulatory proteins. Many cellular proteins that can interact with E6 and E7 have been identified, but the biological relevance of these interactions for viral pathogenesis has not been determined. This is because papillomaviruses are species specific and do not infect heterologous hosts. Here, we use a recently established mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) model to investigate the role of the E7 protein in viral pathogenesis. We show that MmuPV1 E7 is necessary for papilloma formation. The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (RB1) is targeted by many papillomaviral E7 proteins, including cancer-associated HPVs. We show that MmuPV1 E7 can bind RB1 and that infection with a mutant MmuPV1 virus that expresses an RB1 binding-defective E7 mutant caused smaller and fewer papillomas that arise with delayed kinetics.

J	Simmons, Jason D.; Wollish, Amy C.; Heise, Mark T.								A Determinant of Sindbis Virus Neurovirulence Enables Efficient Disruption of Jak/STAT Signaling								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				84	21			11429	11439		10.1128/JVI.00577-10				NOV 2010	2010	Previous studies with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and Sindbis virus (SINV) indicate that alphaviruses are capable of suppressing the cellular response to type I and type II interferons (IFNs) by disrupting Jak/STAT signaling; however, the relevance of this signaling inhibition toward pathogenesis has not been investigated. The relative abilities of neurovirulent and nonneurovirulent SINV strains to downregulate Jak/STAT signaling were compared to determine whether the ability to inhibit IFN signaling correlates with virulence potential. The adult mouse neurovirulent strain AR86 was found to rapidly and robustly inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 in response to IFN-gamma and/or IFN-beta. In contrast, the closely related SINV strains Girdwood and TR339, which do not cause detectable disease in adult mice, were relatively inefficient inhibitors of STAT1/2 activation. Decreased STAT activation in AR86-infected cells was associated with decreased activation of the IFN receptor-associated tyrosine kinases Tyk2, Jak1, and Jak2. To identify the viral factor(s) involved, we infected cells with several panels of AR86/Girdwood chimeric viruses. Surprisingly, we found that a single amino acid determinant, threonine at nsP1 position 538, which is required for AR86 virulence, was also required for efficient disruption of STAT1 activation, and this determinant fully restored STAT1 inhibition when it was introduced into the avirulent Girdwood background. These data indicate that a key virulence determinant plays a critical role in downregulating the response to type I and type II IFNs, which suggests that the ability of alphaviruses to inhibit Jak/STAT signaling relates to their in vivo virulence potential.

We previously proved that Th17 cells, besides having proinflammatory effects, were involved in AVMC by enhancing humoral response. However, the relationship between Th17 cells and CVB3 replication remains unknown. In this experiment, we infected BALB/c mice with CVB3 for establishing AVMC models and then found that, with the increase of viral replication, the expressions of splenic Th17 cells, serum IL-17, and cardiac IL-17 mRNA were elevated significantly, accompanied by the progressive cardiac injuries of AVMC. Furthermore, on day 5, the peak time for viral replication, correlation was positive between cardiac IL-17 mRNA and CVB3 RNA (correlation index = 0.835; p<0.01). Although the expressions of Th1 and CD8(+) T cells, which could secrete the antiviral cytokine IFN-gamma and damage the heart, were also elevated, along with Th17 cells, in AVMC, the neutralization of IL-17 further upregulated the percentages of splenic Th1 and CD8(+) T cells and the levels of cardiac IFN-gamma mRNA. The cardiac pathological changes were obviously improved after neutralization, with reduced viral replication followed by decreases in the cardiac inflammatory cytokines IL-17, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta. These data suggest that Th17 cells contribute to CVB3 replication in AVMC, and that IL-17 might be an important target for regulating the balance of antiviral immunities.

Monoclonal mouse anti-swine IgM was used as the capturing antibody, and rabbit anti-PRV hyperimmune gamma globulin was used as the indicating antibody. Sera from non-PRV-infected, experimentally infected, vaccinated and challenged, passively immune and challenged, and naturally infected swine were evaluated. The PRV MACELISA had a specificity of 95% and was as sensitive and reproducible as previously reported in direct assays. An antibody response was still detectable with the MACELISA 21 days after inoculation. The PRV MACELISA did not detect a consistent antibody response in sera from swine vaccinated with either killed-PRV or modified live-virus vaccines but did detect an antibody response in sera from passively immune pigs after challenge with virulent PRV. These results indicated that the PRV MACELISA may be useful for the rapid serodiagnosis of recent PRV infection in swine.																					WOS:A1992HA10000016	1311334

Phosphorylases and enolases in plasma during experimental virus hepatitis by MHV-3				Attivita fosforilasica ed enolasica del plasma nell'epatite virale sperimentale da MHV-3				GIORN MAI INFETT E PARASSIT				11	(4)			306	307						1959	1959	Phosphorylase activity is absent in the plasma of normal mice, but rises rapidly shortly after infection with the MHV-3 virus. Plasma levels reach a peak about 24 hours after infection and then decrease and disappear between 72 and 96 hours. Enolases are normally present in the plasma, but after experimental infection there is a gradual rise in enzyme activity with a peak at 72 to 96 hours. This time interval corresponds to maximal liver necrosis from the experimental infection in mice. The type of activity curve shown by enolases is similar to those previously reported for transaminases, phosphoglucomutases and fumarases. However, the activity curve and regulatory mechanism for phosphorylases appear to differ from all enzyme systems previously studied. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: MDS																					BCI:BCI19593400008213

Infection of Calves with Bovine Norovirus GIII.1 Strain Jena Virus: an Experimental Model To Study the Pathogenesis of Norovirus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				85	22			12013	12021		10.1128/JVI.05342-11				NOV 2011	2011	The experimental infection of newborn calves with bovine norovirus was used as a homologous large animal model to study the pathogenesis of norovirus infection and to determine target cells for viral replication. Six newborn calves were inoculated orally with Jena virus (JV), a bovine norovirus GIII. 1 strain, and six calves served as mock-inoculated controls. Following infection, calves were euthanized before the onset of diarrhea (12 h postinoculation [hpi]), shortly after the onset of diarrhea (18 to 21 hpi), and postconvalescence (4 days pi [dpi]). Calves inoculated with JV developed severe watery diarrhea at 14 to 16 hpi, and this symptom lasted for 53.5 to 67.0 h. Intestinal lesions were characterized by severe villus atrophy together with loss and attenuation of villus epithelium. Viral capsid antigen (JV antigen) was detected by immunohistochemistry in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells on villi. In addition, granular material positive for JV antigen was detected in the lamina propria of villi. Lesions first appeared at 12 hpi and were most extensive at 18 to 19 hpi, extending from midjejunum to ileum. The intestinal mucosa had completely recovered at 4 dpi. There was no indication of systemic infection as described for norovirus infection in mice. JV was found in intestinal contents by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as early as 12 hpi. Fecal shedding of the virus started at 13 hpi and stopped at 23 hpi or at necropsy (4 dpi), respectively. Throughout the trial, none of the control calves tested positive for JV by ELISA or RT-PCR.																					WOS:000296422700044	21880760

In horses and other natural animal hosts, infections with BDV cause meningoencephalitis and behavioral disturbances. Experimental infection of adult mice takes a nonsymptomatic course, an observation previously believed to indicate that this animal species is not suitable for pathogenesis studies. We now demonstrate that BDV frequently induces severe neurological disease in infected newborn mice. Signs of neurological disease were first observed 4 to 6 weeks after intracerebral infection. They included a characteristic nonphysiological position of the hind limbs at an early stage of the disease and paraparesis at a later stage. Histological examination revealed large numbers of perivascular and meningeal inflammatory cells in brains of diseased mice and, unexpectedly, no increase in immunoreactivity to glial fibrillar acidic protein. The incidence and severity of BDV-induced disease varied dramatically among mouse strains. While only 13% of the infected C57BL/6 mice showed disease symptoms, which were mostly transient, more than 80% of the infected MRL mice developed severe neurological disorder. In spite of these differences in susceptibility to disease, BDV replicated to comparable levels in the brains of mice of the various strains used. Intracerebral infections of newborn beta 2-microglobulin-deficient C57BL/6 and MRL mice, which both lack CD8(+) T cells, did not result in meningoencephalitis or neurological disease, indicating that the BDV-induced neurological disorder in mice is a cytotoxic T-cell-mediated immunopathological process. With this new animal model it should now be possible to characterize the disease-inducing immune response to BDV in more detail.																					WOS:000073090100101	9557728

Recently, epidemic outbreaks of EV71 with significant mortality have been reported in the Asia-Pacific region, and EV71 infection has become a serious public health concern worldwide. However, there is little information available concerning EV71 neuropathogenesis, and no vaccines or anti-EV71 drugs have been developed. Previous studies of this disease have used monkeys and neonatal mice that are susceptible to some EV71 strains as models. The monkey model is problematic for ethical and economical reasons, and mice that are more than a few weeks old lose their susceptibility to EV71. Thus, the development of an appropriate small animal model would greatly contribute to the study of this disease. Mice lack EV71 susceptibility due to the absence of a receptor for this virus. Previously, we identified the human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (hSCARB2) as a cellular receptor for EV71. In the current study, we generated a transgenic (Tg) mouse expressing hSCARB2 with an expression profile similar to that in humans. Tg mice infected with EV71 exhibited ataxia, paralysis, and death. The most severely affected cells were neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and cerebrum. The pathological features in these Tg mice were generally similar to those of EV71 encephalomyelitis in humans and experimentally infected monkeys. These results suggest that this Tg mouse could represent a useful animal model for the study of EV71 infection.																					WOS:000323886200060	23959904

The 1/160 diluted viruses in the IBDV vaccines and the infected bursa of fabricius were observed, while other pathogens such as AIV, NDV, IBV, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pasteurella multocida, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae were not found by the AC-ELISA. 78 samples included the bursa of fabricius, spleens and livers which were experimentally infected with very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) and classic viruses in the vaccines were assayed. It was shown that 24 samples were positive, with 96% (75/78) agreement between AC-ELISA and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), indicating that the AC-ELISA with high sensitivity and specificity can be used to diagnose IBD.

R			University of Pittsburgh						Interleukin-18 and cytotoxic impairment are independent and synergistic causes virus-induced hyperinflammation in mice								European Nucleotide Archive															2021-01-11	2020	To determine the effects of excess IL-18 on virus-induced immunopathology, we infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV, Armstrong). LCMV infection is self-limited in wild-type (WT) mice, but Prf1-/- mice develop prolonged viremia and fatal HLH. LCMV-infected Il18-transgenic (Il18tg) mice developed cachexia and hyperinflammation comparable to Prf1-/- mice, albeit with minimal mortality. We use RNA-sequencing to identify differences in the transcriptome of GP33 - specific CD8 T cells from these mice in comparison to a wild type mouse under the same conditions. We saw expression of Ifng was elevated about 4-fold in both Prf1-/- and Il18tg mice. Genes specifically upregulated in Il18tg CD8 T-cells included Csf2, Il1rl1, and Il12rb2. We also saw differences between Prf1-/- and WT/Il18tg CD8 T-cells that included Klrg1 and transcripts associated with CD8 T-cell exhaustion, including the inhibitory receptors Lag3, Havcr2, and Tigit, and the transcription factors Tox and Prdm1. These data support that IL-18 as a potent, independent, and modifiable driver of life-threatening innate and adaptive hyperinflammation, and support the rationale for an IL-18-driven subclass of hyperinflammation.

Intravenous injection of PB2-as, as a complex with DMRIE-C, a cationic liposome, was most effective for prolonging the mean survival time in days (MSDs) and increasing the survival rates of mice infected with the influenza A virus. In addition, the liposomal PB2-as significantly inhibited viral growth in lung tissues. These results suggest that PBS-as encapsulated with DMRIE-C may be active against the influenza A virus infection through the inhibition of virus replication in the mouse lung.

In contrast to the rat model, little is known about the pathogenesis of spontaneous ED in sheep and horses. The present study describes the brain lesions of 12 ovine and 11 equine cases of naturally occurring ED. A set of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies was used in order to determine the cells operative in encephalitic lesions and to detect expression of MHC-I and MHC-II products in the brains of affected animals. In all cases investigated, a reaction pattern similar to that reported for the acute phase of ED in experimentally infected rats was noted. In brief, the majority of inflammatory cells in perivascular infiltrates (PVI) as well as parenchymal and meningeal infiltrates were CD3+. CD4+ cells outnumbered CD8+ cells in PVI as well as in the parenchyma. Macrophages (defined by lysozyme immunoreactivity) were seen less often and B-cells or plasma cells (cells positive for lambda or kappa light chains) were demonstrated at lower numbers. TCR-1+ cells were found on very rare occasions in PVI of some sheep. MHC-I and MHC-II products were constantly expressed on inflammatory cells but inconsistently on astrocytes and neurons. Neuronal degeneration was not a major feature. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.																					WOS:000073558600005	9613435

In spite of repeated sexual exposure, some individuals remain seronegative, and a small fraction of them produce immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA autoantibodies directed against CCR5, which is probably the cause of the CCR5-minus phenotype observed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of these subjects. These antibodies recognize the 89-to-102 extracellular loop of CCR5 in its native conformation. The aim of this study was to induce infection-preventing mucosal anti-CCR5 autoantibodies in individuals at high risk of HIV infection. Thus, we generated chimeric immunogens containing the relevant CCR5 peptide in the context of the capsid protein of Flock House virus, a presentation system in which it is possible to engineer conformationally constrained peptide in a highly immunogenic form. Administered in mice via the systemic or mucosal route, the immunogens elicited anti-CCR5 IgG and IgA (in sera and vaginal fluids). Analogous to exposed seronegative individuals, mice producing anti-CCR5 autoantibodies express significantly reduced levels of CCR5 on the surfaces of CD4(+) cells from peripheral blood and vaginal washes. In vitro studies have shown that murine IgG and IgA (i) specifically bind human and mouse CD4(+) lymphocytes and the CCR5-transfected U87 cell line, (ii) down-regulate CCR5 expression of CD4(+) cells from both humans and untreated mice, (iii) inhibit Mip-1 beta chemotaxis of CD4(+) CCR5(+) lymphocytes, and (iv) neutralize HIV R5 strains. These data suggest that immune strategies aimed at generating anti-CCR5 antibodies at the level of the genital mucosa might be feasible and represent a strategy to induce mucosal HIV-protective immunity.

The lesions are characterized by vascular congestion, edema and interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) infiltrates. When infected mice were treated with different amounts of lidocaine (a local anesthetic, chemically defined as a tertiary amide compound), reduction in intensity of the pancreatic necrosis and in the number of PMN were observed. Even though lidocaine could interfere with FMDV post-replicative cytolytic mechanisms, it appears that protection against pancreatic necrosis is by attenuation of PMN presentation in the infected tissue.

Markers for Predicting Death as an Outcome for Mice Used in Infectious Disease Research								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				61	6			492	498						DEC 2011	2011	Our goal in this study was to identify objective criteria that could be used to predict an outcome of death in mice subjected to experimental inoculation with infectious organisms. We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected from 4 independent studies that used several infectious agents (influenza virus strains A/HK/x31[H3N2] and A/Puerto Rico/8/34[H1N1], Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Candida albicans) and mouse strains (A/J, DBA/2J, C57BL/6J, BALB/cByp. Postinoculation periods ranged from 5 to 21 d, with survival of 30% to 60% of the subjects. In all studies, mice were implanted with either a subcutaneous identification microchip or an intraabdominal radiofrequency transmitter to allow remote measurement of body temperature. After inoculation, mice were weighed and monitored regularly until death occurred or euthanasia was performed. Hypothermia was the most valuable characteristic for distinguishing mice that would survive or succumb to the infection. In addition, weight loss was useful in some of the models. In some cases, the derived measure of the product of temperature and body weight provided the best differentiation of mice in the 2 outcome categories. Therefore, the utility of these measures varied substantially depending on the specific model. This study demonstrates that specific endpoint markers are not uniformly applicable to different models. Rather, such markers should be developed and tested in the context of the model in which they will be used. The use of validated markers for eventual death can signal the need for preemptive euthanasia to alleviate terminal distress and permit timely collection of biologic samples.

Macrophages Are Targeted by Rotavirus in Experimental Biliary Atresia and Induce Neutrophil Chemotaxis by Mip2/Cxcl2								PEDIATRIC RESEARCH				67	4			345	351		10.1203/PDR.0b013e3181d22a73				APR 2010	2010	Biliary atresia is an obstructive cholangiopathy of unknown etiology. Although the adaptive immune system has been shown to regulate the obstruction of bile ducts in a rotavirus-induced mouse model, little is known about the virus-induced inflammatory response. Here, we hypothesized that cholangiocytes secrete chemoattractants in response to rotavirus. To test this hypothesis, we infected cholangiocyte and macrophage cell lines with rhesus rotavirus type A (RRV), quantified cytokines and chemokines and measured the migration of splenocytes. We also used PCR and immunostaining to search for new cellular targets of RRV in the liver. We found that RRV-infected cholangiocytes induced the mRNA expression for chemokines, but conditioned media failed to promote chemotaxis of splenocytes. Analyzing livers after viral challenge, we detected RRV in hepatic macrophages and demonstrated that media from RRV-infected macrophages have high concentrations of cytokines and chemokines and induced chemotaxis of neutrophils. Most notably, addition of anti-Mip2/Cxcl2 antibodies depleted this chemokine in the conditioned media and completely prevented neutrophil chemotaxis. In conclusion, infected cholangiocytes did not promote chemotaxis of inflammatory cells. Investigating alternate cellular targets of RRV, we detected the virus in hepatic macrophages and found that infected macrophages promoted neutrophil chemotaxis by release of Mip2/Cxcl2 in response to RRV.

Experimental genetic changes in those sequences in gp120 that transform R5 HIV-1 variants into otherwise isogenic X4 viruses make them highly cytopathic(6,7). Thus, it is now believed that R5 variants are less cytopathic for T cells than are X4 variants. However, it is not known why CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection does not lead to a massive CD4(+) T-cell depletion, as occurs in CXCR4-mediated HIV-1 infection. Here we demonstrate that R5 HIV-1 isolates are indeed highly cytopathic, but only for CCR5(+)/CD4(+) T cells. Because these cells constitute only a small fraction of CD4(+) T cells, their depletion does not substantially change the total CD4(+) T-cell count. These results may explain why the clinical stage of HIV disease correlates with viral tropism.																					WOS:000078851600043	10086394

To better characterize this new aquatic alphavirus and to make molecular tools available, a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against SDV non-structural and structural proteins has been generated by immunizing mice with SDV-specific recombinant proteins overexpressed in Escherichia coli as antigens. So far, mAbs against nsP1, nsP3, E2 and Ell SDV proteins have been produced and their reactivity has been characterized by Western blot, radioimmunoprecipitation and indirect immunofluorescence assays. In addition, protein domains recognized by each mAb have been determined by immunofluorescence assay on truncated expressed SDV-derived proteins.

Society for Neuroscience Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner				2003				Abstract No. 917.4	Abstract No. 917.4						2003	2003	There is increasing experimental evidence for a role of endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) in the regulation or modulation of movement. Using an experimental model of viral-induced motor disorders based on Borna Disease virus (BDV), we have examined neurochemical aspects of endocannabinoid function in dyskinetic rats. Rats experimentally infected with BDV develop a hyperkinetic syndrome characterized by spontaneous dyskinesias, dystonias, stereotypies, behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants, dopaminergic hyperactivity and loss of striatal D2 receptors in the indirect striatal outflow pathway. Using a HPLC/MS isotope dilution assay, we quantified endocannabinoid levels in the basal ganglia and found a significant anandamide elevation in nucleus subthalamicus (STN) and a modest increase in the substantia nigra (SN) of infected rats. These results are consistent with a dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system in the extrapyramidal circuit of BD rats. When certain features of BD rats, i.e. dopaminergic stimulation and D2 receptor blockade, were reproduced in normal uninfected rats by simultaneous administration of L-DOPA and the D2 antagonist raclopride, we observed similar anandamide elevations in STN and SN, but not in other basal ganglia areas. Thus, viral and pharmacologic manipulations that reduce activity in the indirect striatal outflow pathway and presumably increase pallidal-STN GABA transmission, are accompanied by increases in anandamide in the STN, consistent with a role for anandamide as a local retrograde transmitter for suppressing inhibition. Characterization of the neurochemical changes underlying motor circuit dysregulation during dyskinesias will enhance understanding of mechanisms and treatments for these disorders.					33rd Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience33rd Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience	November 08-12, 2003November 08-12, 2003	Society of NeuroscienceSociety of Neuroscience	New Orleans, LA, USANew Orleans, LA, USA													BCI:BCI200400206388

In mouse models, gamma delta T cells have been previously demonstrated to influence allergen-driven airways hyper-reactivity (AHR) and can have antiviral activity, implicating them as prime candidates in the pathogenesis of asthma exacerbations. To explore this, we have used human and mouse models of experimental RV-induced asthma exacerbations to examine gamma delta T-cell responses and determine their role in the immune response and associated airways disease. In humans, airway gamma delta T-cell numbers were increased in asthmatic vs. healthy control subjects during experimental infection. Airway and blood gamma delta T-cell numbers were associated with increased airways obstruction and AHR. Airway gamma delta T-cell number was also positively correlated with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) virus load and BAL eosinophils and lymphocytes during RV infection. Consistent with our observations of RV-induced asthma exacerbations in humans, infection of mice with allergic airways inflammation increased lung gamma delta T-cell number and activation. Inhibiting gamma delta T-cell responses using anti-gamma delta TCR (anti-gamma delta T-cell receptor) antibody treatment in the mouse asthma exacerbation model increased AHR and airway T helper type 2 cell recruitment and eosinophilia, providing evidence that gamma delta T cells are negative regulators of airways inflammation and disease in RV-induced asthma exacerbations.

An avian, oncogenic retrovirus replicates in vivo in more than 50% of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes from an endangered grouse								VIROLOGY				386	2			380	386		10.1016/j.virol.2009.01.027				APR 10 2009	2009	Reoccurring infection of reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV), an avian oncogenic retrovirus, has been a major obstacle in attempts to breed and release an endangered grouse, the Attwater's prairie chicken (Tympanicus cupido attwateri). REV infection of these birds in breeding facilities was found to result in significant decreases in the CD4(+) and increases in the CD8(+) lymphocyte populations, although experimental infection of birds resulted in only increases in the CD8(+) lymphocytes. Because our indirect immunofluorescent assay readily detected infection of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes, a triple labeling flow cytometric procedure was developed to quantify the individual lymphocytes infected in vivo with REV. Lymphocytes were gated with a biotinylated pan-leukocyte marker bound to streptavidin R-PE-Cy5. Chicken CD4 or CD8 specific mouse MAb directly labeled with R-PE identified the phenotype and with permeabilizing of cells, infection was indirectly labeled with rabbit IgG specific for the REV gag polypeptide and FITC conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody. More than 50% of the total lymphocytes and of the total CD4(+) or CD8(+) lymphocytes supported in vivo viral expression in all infected birds examined. Remarkably, this level of infection was detected in the absence of visible clinical signs of illness. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000267310200017	19237181

ST6Gal I, a glycosyltransferase expressed by B cells, catalyzes the addition of alpha-2,6 sialic acid to galactose, a modification found on N-linked glycoproteins such as CD22, a negative regulator of B cell activation. We show that SNA lectin, which binds a-2,6 sialic acid linked to galactose, shows high binding on plasma blasts and germinal center B cells following viral infection, suggesting ST6Gal I expression remains high on activated B cells in vivo. To understand the relevance of this modification on the antiviral B cell immune response, we infected ST6Gal I-/- mice with influenza A/HKx31. We demonstrate that the loss of ST6Gal I expression results in similar influenza infectivity in the lung, but significantly reduced early influenza-specific IgM and IgG levels in the serum, as well as significantly reduced numbers of early viral-specific Ab-secreting cells. At later memory time points, ST6Gal I-/- mice show comparable numbers of IgG influenza-specific memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, with similarly high antiviral IgG titers, with the exception of IgG2c. Finally, we adoptively transfer purified B cells from wild-type or ST6Gal I-/- mice into B cell-deficient (mu MT-/-) mice. Recipient mice that received ST6Gal I-/- B cells demonstrated reduced influenza-specific IgM levels, but similar levels of influenza-specific IgG, compared with mice that received wild-type B cells. These data suggest that a B cell intrinsic defect partially contributes to the impaired antiviral humoral response. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182: 4721-4727.

We have demonstrated that a species of African dormice, Graphiurus kelleni, is susceptible to a lethal infection of MPXV and that MPXV replicated in multiple organs of this species. Following intranasal administration, MPXV replicated locally in the nasal mucosa causing necrosis and hemorrhage with subsequent systemic spread to lymph nodes, spleen, liver, and other tissues where it caused severe necrosis and/or hemorrhage leading to death. The dormouse model was validated for testing prophylactic (Dryvax vaccine) and therapeutic (cidofovir) test articles against intranasal challenges with MPXV. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The pH of Activation of the Hemagglutinin Protein Regulates H5N1 Influenza Virus Replication and Pathogenesis in Mice								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	9			4826	4834		10.1128/JVI.03110-12				MAY 2013	2013	After receptor binding and internalization during influenza virus entry, the hemagglutinin (HA) protein is triggered by low pH to undergo irreversible conformational changes that mediate membrane fusion. To investigate how mutations that alter the activation pH of the HA protein influence the fitness of an avian H5N1 influenza virus in a mammalian model, we infected C57BL/6J or DBA/2J mice and compared the replication and virulence of recombinant A/chicken/Vietnam/C58/04 (H5N1) HA-Y23(1)H mutant, wild-type, and HA-H24(1)Q and HA-K58(2)I mutant viruses that have HA activation pH values of 6.3, 5.9, 5.6, and 5.4, respectively. The HA-Y23(1)H mutant virus was highly susceptible to acid inactivation in vitro and was attenuated for growth and virulence in mice, suggesting that an H5N1 HA protein triggered at pH 6.3 is too unstable for the virus to remain fit. Wild-type and HA-H24(1)Q viruses were similar in pathogenicity and grew to similar levels in mice, ducks, and cell cultures derived from both avian and mammalian tissues, suggesting that H5N1 HA proteins triggered at pH values in the range of 5.9 to 5.6 broadly support replication. The HA-K58(2)I mutant virus had greater growth and virulence in DBA/2J mice than the wild type did, although the mutant virus was highly attenuated in ducks. The data suggest that adaptation of avian H5N1 influenza virus for infection in mammals is supported by a decrease in the HA activation pH to 5.4. Identification of the HA activation pH as a host-specific infectivity factor is expected to aid in the surveillance and risk assessment of currently circulating H5N1 influenza viruses.

Our results show that MLT protects mice infected with the virus. The mortality rate was reduced from 100% to 16% merely by increasing the dose from 0 to 1000 mu g/MLT per kg body weight MLT significantly postponed the onset of the disease and death by several days. In surviving mice very high titres of VEE virus IgM antibodies were found seven weeks after virus inoculation. MLT significantly reduced VEE virus levels in blood and brain of infected mice and increased the survival rate when the length of pretreatment was augmented from 3 to 7 or 10 days before virus inoculation. Serum levels of interleukin-2 were not affected by MLT administration. In control mice receiving MLT as well as in infected mice treated or non-treated with MLT, interferon gamma levels in sera were increased. Interleukin-4 concentrations were found to be elevated in sera of non-infected mice receiving MLT, but did not differ from controls in infected mice treated or non-treated with the hormone. MLT reduced the degree of cell destruction produced by VEE virus in culture plates of chicken embryo fibroblasts. The protective effect of MLT warrants further investigation of the possibility of using this hormone for the treatment of humans and equines infected with VEE virus.

Following the previous success in our virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine in mouse model, in this study we determined the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a VLP-based vaccine containing B-cell epitope (748)YSNIGVCK(755) from the spike protein of PEDV incorporated into the hepatitis B virus core capsid (HBcAg), in a comprehensive pregnant gilt vaccination and piglet challenge model. The results showed that the vaccine was able to induce significantly higher virus neutralization response in gilt milk, and provide alleviation of clinical signs for piglets experimentally infected with PEDV. Piglets from pregnant gilt that was vaccinated with the VLP vaccine had faster recovery from the clinical disease, less small intestinal lesions, and higher survival rate at 10 days post-challenge (DPC).

J	Prado, C. O.								Standardization of a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for equine herpesvirus type 1 detection in paraffin-embeded tissues.				Padronizacao de uma Reacao em Cadeia pela Polimerase (PCR) para deteccao do herpesvirus equino tipo 1 em tecidos incluidos em parafina.				Padronizacao de uma Reacao em Cadeia pela Polimerase (PCR) para deteccao do herpesvirus equino tipo 1 em tecidos incluidos em parafina								107 pp.	107 pp.						2011	2011	The eguine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) belongs to Varicellovirus genus, Alphaherpesvirinae subfamily of the Herpesviridae Family. It is an enveloped virus, double stranded linear DNA, composed of 76 distinct genes. The EHV-1 is responsible for great losses in horsebread world. Responsible for neonatal death, mieloencephalopaty, rinopneumonite and abortion, it is widely distributed into brasilian equine population. The purpose of this study was to standardize a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for EHV-1 detection in paraffin-embedded tissues allowing retrospective studies based on the collection histopatological samples. Thus, 12 mice (CH3/Rockfeller) with 21 days of age were inoculated with 3 different isolates of EHV-1, 2 from Argentina and one from Brazil. These mice were observed for 4 days and, after sacrifice by overdose of a combination of ketamine and xylazina, it were subjected to necropsy and collected the lung and central nervous system (SNC). The collected tissues were divided into 2 approximately equal parts: 1 one stored at -20°C until processing, and another set at 10% buffering formalin and later paraffin-embedded. The extraction was performed with continuous 9 fragments of 4 m each, using the extration protocol with proteinase K/fenol/cloroformio. The assessment of analytical sensitivity of PCR were determined using 8 dilutions for all 3 virus isolates. The viral DNA amplification was performed using primers targeted to ORF64. In order to rule out the possible presence of PCR inhibitors and to ensure adeguate extraction of DNA, primers directed to the gene for beta-actin were included It was possible to amplify viral DNA until 10-1 dilution, corresponding to 10-1 to 10-2 DICT50/25 L With the standardized PCR, it was possible to detect the EHV-1 DNA in: (a) 100% (12/12) of lung frozen sample and 100% (12/12) of the paraffin-embedded lung; (b) 91% (11/12) of the frozen CNS and 41% (5/12) CNS paraffin-embedded. Moreover, the standardized PCR was tested in a collection of paraffin-embedded specimens from Pathological Anatomy Laboratory od Biological Institute - Sao Paulo State, taken 5 cases of the abortion in horses. It were possible to detect EHV-1 DNA in: (a) 1 sample from a case in that originally was possible to isolate the EHV-1, (b) 4/4 sample originally negative diagnosed. Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that the standardized PCR performed well for detection viral DNA in paraffin-embedded tissues of experimentally infected animals, and probably a higher diagnostic sensitivity than the methods used for diagnosis of EHV-1 in the collection samples tissues tested for equine.

Atherosclerosis is responsible for most of this pathology and is an inflammatory disease with multiple cytokines and adhesion molecules expressed during atherogenesis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), monocytes, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) have all been implicated in human atherogenesis. A transgenic mouse overexpressing MCP-I in the myocardium and pulmonary arteries develops myocarditis and pulmonary vascular inflammation. We infected MCP-I transgenic mice with a sublethal dose of murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) to look for evidence of accelerated inflammation in vascular tissues overexpressing MCP-1 to determine if MCMV could interact with monocytes and MCP-1 in a manner similar to What may occur in atherogenesis. MCMV infection of MCP-I transgenic mice caused ascites, myocarditis, and pulmonary artery inflammation. which was not present in mock-infected MCP-1 or MCMV-infected wild-type mice. Inflammatory infiltrates in these tissues consisted of macrophages and T lymphocytes similar to the infiltrates been in atherosclerosis. Virus presence in inflamed tissues was demonstrated by infecting transgenic mice with MCMV recombinant virus containing the gene sequence for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Human CMV could be involved in atherogenesis in a similar manner by interacting with monocytes and MCP-1 specifically expressed in vascular walls.																					WOS:000172772400020	11739289

To begin exploring the correlates of HVS infectivity and neutralization, we designed and implemented a new reporter assay. Using this assay, we could demonstrate that HVS neutralizing antibodies are present at high levels in naturally infected squirrel monkeys and are strongly induced after pathogenic, experimental infection of common marmosets. Further, we demonstrated that viral entry is influenced by cellular glycosaminoglycans and that, similar to HHV-8, soluble heparin is capable of blocking infectivity. We next cloned and characterized the positional homologue of HHV-8 K8.1, HVS Orf51. N-glycosidase F treatment indicates that like K8.1, Orf51 is a glycoprotein. Found in the viral particle, it localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum of expressing cells. Like K8.1, Orf51 could bind to agarose-conjugated heparin, implicating this molecule in viral attachment to cells. These studies provide the groundwork for additional experiments into the role that this protein may be playing in viral pathogenicity, persistence, and cell tropism. (C)2004 Elsevier Inc.

Neonatal rats infected with BDV do not mount an aggressive response to the virus like their adult counterparts, but instead develop a persistent BDV infection with less overt clinical sequelae. Recently, the cerebellum, a neural structure associated with regulation of motor behavior, and perhaps with higher cognitive functions, has been demonstrated to be a target of neonatal BDV infections in rats (Bautista ct al, 1995). In the present study neonatal rats were infected with BDV and their cerebella were analyzed histologically and - immunohistochemically at 7 months of age. The cerebella of infected animals were reduced in size but normal foliation and laminar organization was present. However, as visualized with immunohistochemistry for the Purkinje cell-specific antigen calbindin, there were numerous gaps within the Purkinje cell layer and in the molecular layer which contains the Purkinje cell dendritic trees. We estimated the number of Purkinje cells and found there was an approximately 75% loss of PC in adult rats neonatally infected with BDV. These results suggest that neonatal BDV infection may either (1) target the PC and cause the death of these cells directly or (2) acts indirectly by triggering an immune response which is then responsible for the loss of these cells.

J	Gilden, D H; Devlin, M E; Burgoon, M P; Owens, G P								The search for virus in multiple sclerosis brain.								Multiple sclerosis (Houndmills, Basingstoke, England)				2	4			179	83						1996-Nov	1996	Plaque-periplaque areas from MS brain tissue were explanted and propagated in tissue culture. The same in vitro techniques that successfully rescued measles virus from SSPE brain, papovavirus from PML brain, and HSV from normal human trigeminal ganglia, were applied. MS brain cells were also inoculated into chimpanzees, multiple rodent species, and embryonated hens eggs. No neurologic disease developed in experimentally infected animals, and no cytopathic effect was observed in explanted cells, or after cocultivation or fusion of MS brain cells with indicator cells. Further analysis of explanted and cocultivated cells by indirect immunofluorescence with various antiviral antisera prepared against viruses associated with post-infectious encephalomyelitis, as well as antisera to other ubiquitous viruses, failed to detect viral antigen. Finally, attempts to detect a latent enveloped virus in MS brain cells by 'superinfecting' MS brain cells in culture with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) did not reveal a VSV non-neutralizable fraction. Nevertheless, since oligoclonal bands (OGBs) in the CSF of patients with chronic infectious diseases of the CNS are directed against the causative agent, it is likely that OGBs in MS CSF are antibody directed against the agent or antigen that triggered disease. Although the relevant antibody may be scarce relative to irrelevant antibody in MS CSF, and only small amounts of an MS-specific antigen may be present in brain, this report provides a rationale for strategies proposed in our companion report by Owens et al which will allow detection of an MS-specific antigen or its cognate RNA in brain.

Myxoma Virus Infection Promotes NK Lysis of Malignant Gliomas In Vitro and In Vivo								PLOS ONE				8	6					e66825	10.1371/journal.pone.0066825				JUN 10 2013	2013	Myxoma virus (MYXV) is a well-established oncolytic agent against different types of tumors. MYXV is also known for its immunomodulatory properties in down-regulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I surface expression (via the M153R gene product, a viral E3-ubiquitin ligase) and suppressing T cell killing of infected target cells. MHC I down-regulation, however, favors NK cell activation. Brain tumors including gliomas are characterized by high MHC I expression with impaired NK activity. We thus hypothesized that MYXV infection of glioma cells will promote NK cell-mediated recognition and killing of gliomas. We infected human gliomas with MYXV and evaluated their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. MYXV enhanced NK cell-mediated killing of glioma cells (U87 cells, MYXV vs. Mock: 51.73% vs. 28.63%, P =.0001, t test; U251 cells, MYXV vs. Mock: 40.4% vs. 20.03%, P.0007, t test). Using MYXV M153R targeted knockout (designated vMyx-M153KO) to infect gliomas, we demonstrate that M153R was responsible for reduced expression of MHC I on gliomas and enhanced NK cell-mediated antiglioma activity (U87 cells, MYXV vs. vMyx-M153KO: 51.73% vs. 25.17%, P =.0002, t test; U251 cells, MYXV vs. vMyx-M153KO: 40.4% vs. 19.27, P =.0013, t test). Consequently, NK cell-mediated lysis of established human glioma tumors in CB-17 SCID mice was accelerated with improved mouse survival (log-rank P =.0072). These results demonstrate the potential for combining MYXV with NK cells to effectively kill malignant gliomas.																					WOS:000320440500071	23762498

Comparative Neuropathology of Major Indian Bluetongue Virus Serotypes in a Neonatal BALB/c Mouse Model								JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY				162				18	28		10.1016/j.jcpa.2018.06.001				JUL 2018	2018	Bluetongue virus (BTV) is neurotropic in nature, especially in ruminant fetuses and in-utero infection results in abortion and congenital brain malformations. The aim of the present study was to compare the neuropathogenicity of major Indian BTV serotypes 1, 2, 10, 16 and 23 by gross and histopathological lesions and virus distribution in experimentally infected neonatal BALB/c mice. Each BTV serotypc (20 mu l of inoculum containing 1 x 10(5) tissue culture infectious dose [TCID](50)/ml of virus) was inoculated intracerebrally into 3-day-old mice, while a control group was inoculated with mock-infected cell culture medium. Infection with BTV serotypes 1, 2 and 23 led to 65-70% mortality at 7-9 days post infection (dpi) and caused severe necrotizing encephalitis with neurodegenerative changes in neurons, swelling and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, midbrain and brainstem. In contrast, infection with BTV serotypes 10 and 16 led to 25-30% mortality at 9-11 dpi and caused mild neuropathological lesions. BTV antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry, direct fluorescence antibody technique and confocal microscopy in the cytoplasm of neuronal cells of the hippocampus, grey matter of the cerebral cortex and vascular endothelial cells in the midbrain and brainstem of BTV-1, -2, -10, -16 and -23 infected groups from 3 to 20 dpi. BTV nucleic acid was detected in the infected brain tissues from as early as 24 h up to 20 dpi by VP7 gene segment-based one-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. This study of the relative neurovirulence of BTV serotypes is likely to help design suitable vaccination and control strategies for the disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Pneumocystis carinii Infection Causes Lung Lesions Historically Attributed to Rat Respiratory Virus								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				61	1			45	52						FEB 2011	2011	Idiopathic lung lesions characterized by dense perivascular cuffs of lymphocytes and a lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia have been noted in research rats since the 1990s. Although the etiology of this disease has remained elusive, a putative viral etiology was suspected and the term 'rat respiratory virus' (RRV) has been used in reference to this disease agent. The purpose of this study was to determine whether Pneumocystis carinii infection in immunocompetent rats can cause idiopathic lung lesions previously attributed to RRV. In archived paraffin-embedded lungs (n = 43), a significant association was seen between idiopathic lung lesions and Pneumocystis DNA detected by PCR. In experimental studies, lung lesions of RRV developed in 9 of 10 CD rats 5 wk after intratracheal inoculation with P. carinii. No lung lesions developed in CD rats (n = 10) dosed with a 0.22-mu m filtrate of the P. carinii inoculum, thus ruling out viral etiologies, or in sham-inoculated rats (n = 6). Moreover, 13 of 16 CD rats cohoused with immunosuppressed rats inoculated with P. carinii developed characteristic lung lesions from 3 to 7 wk after cohousing, whereas no lesions developed in rats cohoused with immunosuppressed sham-inoculated rats (n = 7). Both experimental infection studies revealed a statistically significant association between lung lesion development and exposure to P. carinii. These data strongly support the conclusion that P. carinii infection in rats causes lung lesions that previously have been attributed to RRV.																					WOS:000287621100007	21819681

Although TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is thought to be immune mediated, there is also evidence that supports a role for the virus in directly inducing demyelination. In order to clarify the function of DA virus genes, we generated a transgenic mouse that had tamoxifen-inducible expression of the DA L-coding region in oligodendrocytes (and Schwann cells), a cell type in which the virus is known to persist. Tamoxifen-treated young transgenic mice usually developed an acute progressive fatal paralysis, with abnormalities of the oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells and demyelination, but without significant lymphocytic infiltration; later treatment led to transient weakness with demyelination and persistent expression of the recombined transgene. These findings demonstrate that a high level of expression of DA L can cause the death of myelin-synthesizing cells and death of the mouse, while a lower level of L expression (which can persist) can lead to cellular dysfunction with survival. The results suggest that expression of DA L plays an important role in the pathogenesis of TMEV-IDD. Virus-induced infection and death of oligodendrocytes may play a part in the demyelination of other diseases in which an immune-mediated mechanism has been stressed, including multiple sclerosis.

Two strains of E. coli, namely Enterotoxigenic, ETEC and Enterohemorrhagic EHEC are the most important causes of this disease in developing countries. EHEC is a major causative agent of bloody diarrhea and hemorrhagic uremic syndrome, while ETEC is the most important cause of diarrhea in neonates and travelers. Objectives: To evaluate the immunologic properties of a subunit vaccine candidate comprising the main immunogenic epitopes from these two bacterial strains. Methods: The construct comprised of LTB and CfaB antigens from ETEC, and Intimin and Stx2B antigens from EHEC, was designed, analyzed and synthesized using bioinformatics methods. The chimeric gene was sub-cloned in the expression vector and expressed in E. coli host. The purified chimera protein was injected subcutaneously into the experimental animals. The production of specific antibodies was confirmed by immunological methods, and the protection capacity was evaluated by the challenge of immunized mice with the pathogenic bacteria. Results: Chimeric recombinant protein was able to increase IgG titer. Neutralization assay indicated that the antibodies generated against LtB moiety were able to neutralize ETEC toxin. In animal challenge study, all non-immune mice died within 3 days after the injection of toxin, but all immunized mice survived from Stx toxin. Conclusions: The immunity to both ETEC and EHEC bacteria is significant, and this structure can be considered as a candidate for vaccine production against these bacterial strains.

Blood				100	11 			1707	Abstract No. 1707						November 16, 2002	2002	Haemophilia A is an inherited X-linked lifelong bleeding disorder caused by genetic abnormalities of the coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) gene and gene therapy is respected to the next generation therapy for haemophilia A. To establish haemophilia A gene therapy, we developed simian immunodeficiency virus agmTYO1 (SIVagmTYO1)-based vectors carrying the human FVIII transgene (SIVhFVIII) and demonstrated that transplantation of CD34 positive (CD34+) cells transduced by SIVhFVIII could be used for gene therapy of hemophilia A. We could transduce cord blood derived CD34+ cells (CB-CD34+) cells efficiently using SIVagm vectors carrying the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) transgene in a dose dependent manner, reaching the maximum (99.6+-0.1%) at MOI 5x103 vg/cell and 274.3+-20.1 ng of human coagulation factor VIII (hFVIII) production from 106 CB-CD34+ cells during 24hr incubation was achieved by transducing CB-CD34+ cells by SIVhFVIII in vitro. 60 day after transplantation of SIVhFVIII-transduced CB-CD34+ cells (5x105) into nonobese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice, 7.4+-2.5% of the mouse peripheral white blood cells were human CD45 positive, and 42.8 % and 22.9 % of the mouse bone marrow cells were human CD45 positive and human CD34 positive, respectively, suggesting that successful engraftment of SIVhFVIII-transduced CD34+ cells in NOD/SCID mice was achieved. Therapeutic level production of human FVIII (minimum 1.2+-0.9 ng/mL, maximum 3.6+-0.8 ng/mL) were sustained for at least 60 days in vivo. The RT-PCR analysis and the immunofluorescent study showed that transcripts of the hFVIII transgene and hFVIII molecules were present in bone marrow cells on day 60 after transplantation. There was no significant difference in lineage marker expression of human hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and the spleen between SIVhFVIII-transduced cell transplanted NOD/SCID mice and non-transduced cell transplanted NOD/SCID mice, suggesting that stable human FVIII gene transduction by SIV vector does not alter the capability of CB-CD34+ cells to repopulate and expand in the mouse hematopoietic microenvironment. In conclusion, transplantation of SIVhFVIII-transduced CB-CD34+ cells enabled their engraftment in NOD/SCID mice, constitutive expression of therapeutic transgene expression, and FVIII production in vivo. SIVagmTYO1 is not pathogenic to its natural hosts or to experimentally infected Asian macaques. Furthermore, the risk of development of the replication competent lentivirus particles in HIV carrier patients may be significantly lower than HIV-1 based vector because of the low sequence homology between HIV-1 and SIVagmTOY1. In this regard, SIVagmTYO1-based vectors have an advantage regarding safety issues and clinical application of gene therapy. These data suggest that transplantation of ex vivo transduced hematopoietic stem cells by non-pathogenic SIVhFVIII without exposure of subjects to viral vectors is safe and useful for gene therapy of haemophilia A.					44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology	December 06-10, 2002December 06-10, 2002	American Society of HematologyAmerican Society of Hematology	Philadelphia, PA, USAPhiladelphia, PA, USA													BCI:BCI200300336307

In subregions of adjacent sections corresponding to ISPCR-labeled and unlabeled areas, HSV specificity was verified using solution PCR and Southern blots. In serial sections, ISPCR results were compared to lesions, HSV antigen and, in selected samples, to viral sequence detection by in situ hybridization. By ISPCR, HSV-specific labeling was limited to HSV-infected neonates and experimentally infected mouse controls. ISPCR-labeled cells corresponded to regions that were histologically abnormal and contained HSV antigen or in situ hybridization signal in some foci; in others, labeled cells were in areas with no evident lesions or antigen. Results suggest two routes of HSV spread to the CNS: (i) blood-borne infection, with HSV DNA in splenic lymphocytes, circulating cells, meningeal vessel walls and cells in intraventricular hemorrhage, and (ii) neural spread, with HSV detected in brain stem sensory neurons. In the brain of one neonate surviving acute infection, detection of HSV nucleic acid sequences suggests a latent or persistent viral genome. With other methods, this highly sensitive ISPCR technique permits a more complete definition of HSV infection in these infants and provides new insights into disease mechanisms. Fuller understanding of HSV persistence and recurrent neurological disease in survivors will require further studies using these and other techniques in human tissues and in animal models.

In the paper, three highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza viruses were isolated from three species of migratory birds in Qinghai Province of China in 2006. The analysis of the genome sequences indicated that the three isolates shared high homology with each other (94% to 99%). Three isolates shared a common ancestor and were closest to strains isolated from Qinghai and Siberia in 2005, but distinct from poultry viruses found in Southeast Asia. In experimental infection, all three viruses were highly pathogenic to chickens and mice. The results suggest that highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 viruses still exist in the migratory birds and could spread to other regions with wild bird migration.

C57BL/6 mice were induced to immunocompromised state by intraperitoneal injection of LP-BM5 MuLV and revealed the typical splenomegaly and lymphatic enlargement of axillar and inguinal regions on necropsy 4 weeks after viral infection. Although there was no significant difference in the mortality rate of MAIDS mouse according to the culture temperature, it was very different in the mortality rate from strain to strain of Acanthamoeba. A. healyi OC-3A strain isolated from the brain of a GAE patient showed the highest mortality rate and A. culbertsoni A-1 strain from tissue culture was the second. KA/S3 and KA/S2 strains isolated from soil revealed very low virulence. The mice infected by intranasal inoculation of Acanthamoeba showed relatively chronic course than intravenous inoculation. The gross findings of lungs and brains from infected mice were variable among mice. On the microscopic observations, the lungs showed much more severe inflammation and necrosis than the brains microscopically. This MAIDS model would be useful to study the opportunistic protozoan infections of AIDS patients. In the light of these results, the pathogenic potential and the virulence of Acanthamoeba may be determined genetically.																					BCI:BCI199800184635	9529860

The recent northerly spread of BTV serotype 8 in Europe resulted in outbreaks characterized by clinical signs in cattle, including unusual teratogenic effects. Vaccination has been shown to be crucial for controlling the spread of vector-borne diseases such as BTV. With the aim of developing a novel subunit vaccine targeting BTV-8 that allows differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals, five His-tagged recombinant proteins, VP2 and VP5 of BTV-8 and NS1, NS2, and NS3 of BTV-2, were expressed in baculovirus or Escherichia coli expression systems for further study. Optimized purification protocols were determined for VP2, NS1, NS2, and NS3, which remained stable for detection for at least 560 to 610 days of storage at +4 degrees C or -80 degrees C, and Western blotting using sera from vaccinated or experimentally infected cattle indicated that VP2 and NS2 were recognized by BTV-specific antibodies. To characterize murine immune responses to the four proteins, mice were subcutaneously immunized twice at a 4-week interval with one of three protein combinations plus immunostimulating complex ISCOM-Matrix adjuvant or with ISCOM-Matrix alone (n = 6 per group). Significantly higher serum IgG antibody titers specific for VP2 and NS2 were detected in immunized mice than were detected in controls. VP2, NS1, and NS2 but not NS3 induced specific lymphocyte proliferative responses upon restimulation of spleen cells from immunized mice. The data suggest that these recombinant purified proteins, VP2, NS1, and NS2, could be an important part of a novel vaccine design against BTV-8.																					WOS:000332036900022	24451327

These functions are transduced following binding of Epo to a specific cell surface receptor, the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), a member of a new cytokine receptor superfamily of receptors. An activating mutation in the murine EpoR has been described (cEpoR) and confers growth factor-independent growth upon an IL-3-dependent pro-B cell. To determine the effect of an activating mutation in the EpoR upon erythropoiesis specifically and hematopoiesis generally, we infected hematopoietic progenitors and mice with a recombinant erythroleukemic spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV), lacking its pathogenic env gene but expressing cEpoR (SFFVcEpoR). In vitro, infection with SFFVcEpoR resulted in factor-independent growth and development of CFU-Es yet had no effect on BFU-E growth, mixed colony gowth, or myeloid colony growth. Mice infected with SFFVcEpoR, but not a virus expressing wild type EpoR (SFFVEpoR), developed erythrocytosis and splenomegaly.					15TH SYMP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOC FOR COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON LEUKEMIA AND RELATED DISEASES15TH SYMP OF THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOC FOR COMPARATIVE RESEARCH ON LEUKEMIA AND RELATED DISEASES	OCT 06-11, 1991OCT 06-11, 1991	INT ASSOC COMPARAT RES LEUKEMIA & RELATED DIS; ASSOC ITALIANA RIC CANC; LEUKEMIA SOC AMER; NCI; FIDIA RES LABS; BANCO SAN MARCO; AMMINISTRAZIONE PROV PADOVA; CITY PADOVA; UNIV PADOVAINT ASSOC COMPARAT RES LEUKEMIA & RELATED DIS; ASSOC ITALIANA RIC CANC; LEUKEMIA SOC AMER; NCI; FIDIA RES LABS; BANCO SAN MARCO; AMMINISTRAZIONE PROV PADOVA; CITY PADOVA; UNIV PADOVA	PADUA, ITALYPADUA, ITALY													WOS:A1992JD26600036	1318465

J	Fickenscher, H; Fleckenstein, B								Herpesvirus saimiri								PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				356	1408			545	567		10.1098/rstb.2000.0780				APR 29 2001	2001	Herpesvirus saimiri (saimiriine herpesvirus 2) is the classical prototype of the gamma (2)-herpesviruses or rhadinoviruses, which also contains a human member, the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. The T-lymphotropic Herpesvirus saimiri establishes specific replicative and persistent conditions in different primate host species. Virtually all squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) are persistently infected with this virus. In its natural host, the virus does not cause disease, whereas it induces fatal acute T-cell lymphoma in other monkey species after experimental infection. The virus can be isolated by cocultivation of permissive epithelial cells with peripheral blood cells from naturally infected squirrel monkeys and from susceptible New World monkeys during the virus-induced disease. Tumour-derived and in vitro-transformed T-cell lines from New World monkeys release virus particles. Herpesvirus ateles is a closely related virus of spider monkeys (Ateles spp.) and has similar pathogenic properties to Herpesvirus saimiri in other New World primate species.Similar to other rhadinoviruses, the genome of Herpesvirus saimiri harbours a series of virus genes with pronounced homology to cellular counterparts including a D-type cyclin, a G-protein coupled receptor, an interleukin-17, a superantigen homologue, and several inhibitors: of the complement cascade and of different apoptosis pathways. Preserved function has been demonstrated for most of the homologues of cellular proteins. These viral functions are capability of the virus. However, they are considered relevant for the pathogenic persistence of Herpesvirus saimiri in its natural host. A terminal region of the non-repetitive coding part of the virus genome is essential for pathogenicity and T-cell transformation. Based on the pathogenic phenotypes and the different alleles of this variable region, the virus strains have been assigned to three subgroups, termed A, B and C. In the highly oncogenic subgroup C strains, the two virus genes stpC and tip are transcribed from one bicistronic mRNA and are essential for transformation and leukaemia induction. stpC fulfils the typical criteria of an oncogene; its product interacts with Ras and tumour necrosis factor-associated factors and induces mitogen-activated protein kinase and nuclear factor kappa B activation. Tip interacts with the RNA transport factor Tap, with signal transduction and activation of transcription factors, and with the T-cellular tyrosine kinase Lck, which is activated by this interaction and phosphorylates Tip as a substrate.It is of particular interest that certain subgroup C virus strains such as C488 are capable of transforming human T lymphocytes to stable growth in culture. The transformed human T cells harbour multiple copies of the viral genome in the form of stable, non-integrated episomes. The cells express only a few virus genes and do not produce virus particles. The transformed cells maintain the antigen specificity and many other essential functions of their parental T-cell clones. Based on the prescribed functional phenotype of the transformed T cells, Herpesvirus saimiri provides useful tools for T-cell immunology; for gene transfer and possibly also for experimental adoptive immunotherapy.

J	Ridley, RM; Baker, HF								The nature of transmission in prion diseases								NEUROPATHOLOGY AND APPLIED NEUROBIOLOGY				23	4			273	280						AUG 1997	1997	Replicating biological information is usually stored only within nucleic acid. The existence of 'strains' of agent in prion disease (scrapie, BSE, CTD has been taken to indicate an independent genome within the transmissible agent. Other replicable information exists, however, both in biology and elsewhere, including, for example, the 'meme' (the neural correlate of ideas which replicate in human brains by communication) and the computer virus. From this broader viewpoint, we explore the possibility that 'strain' differences in prion disease reflect biological information stored within the prion protein rather than in nucleic acid. Much of the disease variation in mice (used as evidence for strain differences) can be accounted for by the primary structures of the prion protein of the host (the experimentally infected mouse) and the donor mouse (from which infectious tissue is taken). Information determining residual disease variation (when these factors have been excluded) map reside in different conformational states of host prion protein, Prion protein can adopt different conformational and glycosylation states. The information which these states contain is only partially conserved on transmission between animals, permitting the appearance of both 'strain stability' and 'strain mutation'. Different sources of replicating, biological information including information in the 'agent' (the abnormal form of prion protein) and in the host prion gene (PRNP) are in evolutionary competition, We argue that, in the prion diseases, replicating information is not carried in nucleic acid in either the host or the 'agent' but is carried within the conformational state of the abnormal form of prion protein.

Across large parts of Eurasia TBEV is found in three traditional subtypes: the European, the Siberian and the Far-eastern subtype. Small mammalian animals play an important role in the transmission cycle as they enable the spread of TBEV among the vector tick population. To assess the impact of TBEV infection on its natural hosts, outbred bank voles (Myodes glareolus) were inoculated with one out of four European TBEV strains. Three of these TBEV strains were recently isolated in Germany. The forth one was the TBEV reference strain Neudo center dot rfl. Sampling points at 7, 14, 28, and 56 days post inoculation allowed the characterization of the course of infection. At each time point, six animals per strain were euthanized and eleven organ samples (brain, spine, lung, heart, small and large intestine, liver, spleen, kidney, bladder, sexual organ) as well as whole blood and serum samples were collected. The majority of bank voles (92/96) remained clinically unaffected after the inoculation with TBEV, but still developed a systemic infection during the first week, which transitioned to a viraemia and an infestation of the brain in some animals for the remainder of the first month. Viral RNA was found in whole blood samples of several animals (50/96), but only in a small fraction of the corresponding serum samples (4/50). From the whole blood, virus was successfully reisolated in cell culture until 14 days after inoculation. Less than five percent of all inoculated bank voles (4/96) displayed signs of distress in combination with a rapid weight loss and had to be euthanized prematurely. Overall, the recently isolated TBEV strains showed marked differences, such as a more frequent development of long-term viraemia and a higher detection rate of viral RNA in various organs, in comparison to the reference strain Neudo center dot rfl. Overall, our data suggest that the bank vole is a potential amplifying host in the TBEV transmission cycle and appears to be highly adapted to circulating TBEV strains.

Similar to other animal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 contains a functional furin cleavage site in its spike protein, which may broaden the SARS-CoV-2 host range and affect pathogenesis. Whether ongoing zoonotic infections are possible in addition to efficient human-to-human transmission remains unclear. In contrast, human-to-animal transmission can occur based on evidence provided from natural and experimental settings. Carnivores, including domestic cats, ferrets and minks, appear to be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 in contrast to poultry and other animals reared as livestock such as cattle and swine. Epidemiologic evidence supported by genomic sequencing corroborated mink-to-human transmission events in farm settings. Airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between experimentally infected cats additionally substantiates the possibility of cat-to-human transmission. To evaluate the COVID-19 risk represented by domestic and farmed carnivores, experimental assessments should include surveillance and health assessment of domestic and farmed carnivores, characterization of the immune interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and carnivore coronaviruses, determination of the SARS-CoV-2 host range beyond carnivores and identification of human risk groups such as veterinarians and farm workers. Strategies to mitigate the risk of zoonotic SARS-CoV-2 infections may have to be developed in a One Health framework and non-pharmaceutical interventions may have to consider free-roaming animals and the animal farming industry.

Development of monoclonal antibodies against chicken IgM and its application in immunity studies								Indian Journal of Biotechnology				6	2			187	193						APR 2007	2007	Immunoglobulin M (IgM) from specific pathogen free (SPF) chicken serum was purified and used for production of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for subsequent application in the detection of primary immune response to infectious agents. Chicken IgM was fractionated by gel filtration technique using Sephadex G-200. Purity of the fractionated IgM was confirmed by agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) and immunoelectrophoresis (IE) using rabbit anti-chicken serum. In polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), under non-reducing conditions, a single band was noticed and under reduced conditions, a band with molecular weight of 74 kDa was observed. Cell fusion was carried out with spleenocytes from immunized BALB/c mice and Sp2/0 cells, and the high positive clones were selected and characterized for isotype and cross-reactivity with IgY in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Three MAbs chosen for characterization were of IgG1 isotype and they did not cross-react with standard IgY in ELISA. Concentrated IgM MAbs developed in this study were used in ELISA for the measurement of immune response in sequentially collected serum samples of birds, experimentally infected with egg drop syndrome (EDS-76) virus. The purified virus was coated onto the ELISA plates, followed by the addition of sera samples to be tested, MAbs against chicken IgM, anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate and substrate. The assay revealed an increase in IgM response in individual birds from 5-12 d with a peak on 9th d postinoculation (PI), followed by an increase in IgG on 12-25 d PI. IgM antibodies against infectious bursal disease (IBD) virus were tested in 34 field serum samples. Comparison with AGPT revealed a marginal increase in sensitivity with IgM ELISA for detection of IBD virus specific IgM.																					BCI:BCI200700359828

Recently, we found that entry of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) into skin cells depends on dynamin, although our results supported that viral internalization occurs via both direct fusion with the plasma membrane and via endocytic pathways. To further explore the role of dynamin for efficient HSV-1 entry, we utilized conditional dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 double-knockout (DKO) fibroblasts as an experimental tool. Strikingly, HSV-1 entered control and DKO fibroblasts with comparable efficiencies. For comparison, we infected DKO cells with Semliki Forest virus, which is known to adopt clathrin-mediated endocytosis as its internalization pathway, and observed efficient virus entry. These results support the notion that the DKO cells provide alternative pathways for viral uptake. Treatment of cells with the dynamin inhibitor dynasore confirmed that HSV-1 entry depended on dynamin in the control fibroblasts. As expected, dynasore did not interfere with viral entry into DKO cells. Electron microscopy of HSV-1-infected cells suggests viral entry after fusion with the plasma membrane and by endocytosis in both dynamin-expressing and dynamin-deficient cells. Infection at low temperatures where endocytosis is blocked still resulted in HSV-1 entry, although at a reduced level, which suggests that nonendocytic pathways contribute to successful entry. Overall, our results strengthen the impact of dynamin for HSV-1 entry, as only cells that adapt to the lack of dynamin allow dynamin-independent entry.IMPORTANCE The human pathogen herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) can adapt to a variety of cellular pathways to enter cells. In general, HSV-1 is internalized by fusion of its envelope with the plasma membrane or by endocytic pathways, which reflects the high adaptation to differences in its target cells. The challenges are to distinguish whether multiple or only one of these internalization pathways leads to successful entry and, furthermore, to identify the mode of viral uptake. In this study, we focused on dynamin, which promotes endocytic vesicle fission, and explored how the presence and absence of dynamin can influence viral entry. Our results support the idea that HSV-1 entry into mouse embryonic fibroblasts depends on dynamin; however, depletion of dynamin still allows efficient viral entry, suggesting that alternative pathways present upon dynamin depletion can accomplish viral internalization.

RIG-I Signaling via MAVS Is Dispensable for Survival in Lethal Influenza Infection In Vivo								MEDIATORS OF INFLAMMATION				2018						6808934	10.1155/2018/6808934				2018	2018	Retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is an important regulator of virus-induced antiviral interferons (IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines. It requires interaction with an adaptor molecule, mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), to activate downstream signaling pathways. To elucidate the mechanism(s) by which RIG-I-dependent recognition of IAV infection in vivo triggers innate immune responses, we infected mutant mice lacking RIG-I or MAVS with influenza A virus (IAV) and measured their innate immune responses. As has previously been demonstrated with isolated deletion of the virus recognition receptors TLR3, TLR7, and NOD2, RIG-I or MAVS knockout (KO) did not result in higher mortality and did not reduce IAV-induced cytokine responses in mice. Infected RIG-I KO animals displayed similar lung inflammation profiles as did WT mice, in terms of the protein concentration, total cell count, and inflammatory cell composition in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. RNA-Seq results demonstrated that all types of mice exhibited equivalent antiviral and inflammatory gene responses following IAV infection. Together, the results indicated that although RIG-I is important in innate cytokine responses in vitro, individual deletion of the genes encoding RIG-I or MAVS did not change survival or innate responses in vivo after IAV infection in mice.

In this study, viral transcription has been analysed in a persistently infected B-cell line and abundant and preferential transcription of open reading frame M3 has been identified. Significantly, in situ hybridization analysis of latently infected mouse spleens with probes corresponding to 20 MHV-68 ORFs demonstrated active transcription of a single ORF, corresponding to M3. The kinetics and pattern of transcription of M3 were compared with that of the virally encoded tRNAs (vtRNAs), previously demonstrated to constitute a marker far latent infection in the spleen. Transcription of vtRNAs in splenic tissue could be first detected at 7 days post-inoculation (p.i.) in scattered cells in periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS). At 10 days p.i., vtRNA transcription was widespread and localized not only to cells in PALS but also to cells within developing germinal centres and from 21 days p.i. expression was detected exclusively within lymphoid follicles. Transcription of vtRNAs could be detected as late as 70 days p.i. In contrast, the histological localization of M3 transcription, which was first detected at 7 days p.i. in scattered cells in PALS, never changed and transcription could not be detected beyond 21 days p.i. These results suggest that M3 is an ORF that is expressed early during the establishment of latency in vivo.																					WOS:000078135200013	9934687

The experimental infection allows the measurement of viral replication in the liver by macroscopic lesions and the evaluation of mortality from encephalitis. Mice intravenously inoculated with a highly virulent clinical HSV-1 isolate were orally treated by gavage over a period of 3 days starting on day 2 post infection. The reference drug acyclovir (ACV) was administered subcutaneously. Necrotic hepatitis was significantly (p < 0.01) reduced by treatment with FCV, VACV and ACV at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day divided into 3 doses. No significant effect was achieved with BVDU at 200 mg/kg per day. Treatment with FCV at 50 mg/kg per day, ACV at 100 mg/kg per day, and VACV at 200 mg/kg per day significantly (p < 0.001) decreased mortality in mice. BVDU treatment at 200 mg/kg per day did not reduce mortality but significantly prolonged (p < 0.05) the survival time.																					WOS:A1997XQ43100003	9268766

A Live Olfactory Mouse Cytomegalovirus Vaccine, Attenuated for Systemic Spread, Protects against Superinfection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				95	21					e01264-21	10.1128/JVI.01264-21				NOV 2021	2021	Vaccination against the betaherpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a public health goal. However, HCMV has proved difficult to vaccinate against. Vaccination against single HCMV determinants has not worked, suggesting that immunity to a wider antigenic profile may be required. Live attenuated vaccines provide the best prospects for protection, but the question remains as to how to balance vaccine virulence with safety. Animal models of HCMV infection provide insights into identifying targets for virus attenuation and understanding how host immunity blocks natural, mucosal infection. Here, we evaluated the vaccine potential of a mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) vaccine deleted of a viral G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), designated M33, that renders it attenuated for systemic spread. A single noninvasive olfactory Delta M33 MCMV vaccine replicated locally, but as a result of the loss of the M33 GPCR, it failed to spread systemically and was attenuated for latent infection. Vaccination did not prevent host entry of a superinfecting MCMV but spread from the mucosa was blocked. This approach to vaccine design may provide a viable alternative for a safe and effective betaherpesvirus vaccine.IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most common cause of congenital infection for which a vaccine is not yet available. Subunit vaccine candidates have failed to achieve licensure. A live HCMV vaccine may prove more efficacious, but it faces safety hurdles which include its propensity to persist and to establish latency. Understanding how pathogens infect guide rational vaccine design. However, HCMV infections are asymptomatic and thus difficult to capture. Animal models of experimental infection provide insight. Here, we investigated the vaccine potential of a mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) attenuated for systemic spread and latency. We used olfactory vaccination and virus challenge to mimic its natural acquisition. We provide proof of concept that a single olfactory MCMV that is deficient in systemic spread can protect against wild-type MCMV superinfection and dissemination. This approach of deleting functional counterpart genes in HCMV may provide safe and effective vaccination against congenital HCMV disease.																					WOS:000708639000013	34431701

To determine if these antibodies ma) interfere with virus isolation, we simulated the isolation procedure using Aedes aegypti (L.) that we infected with the 16681 strain of dengue type 2 virus by intrathoracic inoculation. At 7 d postinfection, we allowed females to engorge on immunized or normal mouse blood. Virus in a mixture of anti-dengue-e antibodies and dengue-2 virus became inactive after incubation at 37 degrees C for 1 h, but remained infective without incubation. Therefore, at ambient conditions antibodies would not interfere with virus isolation from field-collected Ac, aegypti from endemic areas. In addition, DEN antibodies enhanced virus replication when inoculated into Ae. aegypti, but not C6/36 cells. The mechanism for this in vitro antibody enhancement of infection remains unclear.																					WOS:000089625300023	10916310

Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic analysis of the purified samples revealed the presence of oily one major species of viral protein of about 60 kilodaltons after Coomassie staining. The same band, presumably that of the capsid protein, was detected by western blotting using a mouse hyperimmune serum. This capsid protein was synthesized in MDCK cells as early as 2 hr post-inoculation. Experimental infection of dogs resulted in the production of anti-CaCV antibodies which were detected by microneutralization test and western blotting. Likewise, serosurvey revealed not only the presence of neutralizing antibodies but also reactivity of the field sera against the capsid protein of the purified virus. These results indicate that the capsid protein of CaCV No. 48 strain is immunogenic and could be detected by antibodies in western blotting.																					BCI:BCI199799473802

Sequence analysis of the open reading frame (ORF) in the MMTV 3' long terminal repeat indicated that the two MMTV, MMTV (II TES2) and MMTV (II TES14), encode superantigens specific for V beta 2(+) T cells and V beta 14(+) T cells, respectively. In an experiment of subcutaneous injection of II TES milk, both T cells bearing TCR V beta 2 and V beta 14 proliferated vigorously in the draining lymph node from BALB/c mice (H-2(d)I-E(+)), whereas only V beta 14(+) T cells showed significant proliferation in C57BL/6 mouse (B6H-2(b)I-E(-)) lymph nodes. These findings indicated that the superantigen encoded by MMTV (II TES2) required MHC class II I-E molecules exclusively for Ag presentation, but MMTV (II TES14) stimulated V beta 14(+) T cells even in the absence of I-E molecules. Semiquantitative analysis of MMTV proviruses using PCR revealed that B6 mice were not infected with MMTV (II TES2) by injection of this MMTV alone. However, injection of II TES milk containing both MMTV (II TES14) and MMTV (II TES2) induced infection of B6 mice with MMTV (II TES2) besides MMTV (II TES14), in spite of no expansion of V beta 2(+) T cells in this mouse strain. These results suggested that I-E-negative mice were concomitantly infected with MMTV (II TES2) with the help of I-E independent T cell activation mediated by MMTV (II TES14).

Because histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of paraffin-embedded tissues play an important role in recognizing infectious agents in tissue samples, six in-house polyclonal antibodies raised against three representative enteroviruses using an indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry were examined. This panel of polyclonal antibodies recognized three serotypes of enterovirus. Two of the polyclonal antibodies were raised against denatured virus particles from enterovirus A71, one was raised against the recombinant VP1 protein of coxsackievirus B3, and the other for poliovirus type 1 were raised against denatured virus particles, the recombinant VP1 protein and peptide 2C. Western blot analysis revealed that each of these antibodies recognized the corresponding viral antigen and none cross-reacted with non-enteroviruses within the family Picornaviridae. However, all cross-reacted to some extent with the antigens derived from other serotypes of enterovirus. Indirect immunofluorescence assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that the virus capsid and non-structural proteins were localized in the cytoplasm of affected culture cells, and skeletal muscles and neurons in neonatal mice experimentally-infected with human enterovirus. The antibodies also recognized antigens derived from recent clinical isolates of enterovirus A71, coxsackievirus B3 and poliovirus. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that representative antibodies tested showed the same recognition pattern according to each serotype. Thus, the panel of in-house anti-enterovirus polyclonal antibodies described herein will be an important tool for the screening and pathological diagnosis for enterovirus infections, and may be useful for the classification of different enterovirus serotypes, including coxsackieviruses A and B, echoviruses, enterovirus A71 and poliovirus.

Iraqi Journal of Veterinary Medicine				42	1			72	78						2018	2018	Equine herpesvirus type1 was classified as a member of the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. It was reported to cause respiratory, reproductive and neurologic infection in horses. The reproductive form of the disease induces abortion in pregnant mare, while the neurologic form is associated with paralysis of infected horses. This study was designed for molecular detection of Equine herpesvirus type1 by polymerase chain reaction. Blood buffy coat samples were collected from 25 horses (Equus feruscaballus) and 25 donkeys (Equus asinus) admitted to local private veterinary clinics around Baghdad and Baaquba cities. DNA was extracted from such samples by the use of DNA extraction kit of COLLECTAGENET. The samples were subjected to conventional PCR test using specific primers for gB gene of equine herpesvirus-1. Forward primer (F) (5′ TAACTGAGATCT AACCGAC 3′) and reverse primer (R) (CATATATAGCTATCACGTCC 3′). One buffy coat sample from aborted mare and one buffy coat sample from a donkey suffering from acute respiratory clinical signs were inoculated in mice to follow the fate of equine herpesvirus-1 in nasal turbinates, cervical lymph nodes and lungs of these mice. The results showed that only 4 samples from horses and 2 samples from donkeys were positive to polymerase chain reaction. Experimentally infected mice did not show any clinical signs but they were positive to polymerase chain reaction, and the virus easily terminated, probably due to low dose of the virus and host specificity. It can be concluded that local horses and donkeys, somewhere have had infected with equine herpesvirus-1, and became latent carriers for the virus. Furthermore, microbiological and epidemiological studies on local Equine herpesvirus type1 and Equine herpesvirus type 4 are recommended.																					CABI:20193172571

A well-studied example is the tick-borne infection by the gram-negative spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia in humans and other mammals, causing severe symptoms of chronic inflammation and subsequent tissue damage (Lyme Disease), particularly in large joints and the central nervous system, but also in the heart and other tissues of untreated patients. Although killed efficiently by human phagocytic cells in vitro, Borrelia exhibits a remarkably high infectivity in mice and men. In experimentally infected mice, the first immune response almost clears the infection. However, approximately 1 week post infection, the bacterial population recovers and reaches an even larger size before entering the chronic phase.We developed a mathematical model describing the bacterial growth and the immune response against Borrelia burgdorferi in the C3H mouse strain that has been established as an experimental model for Lyme disease.The peculiar dynamics of the infection exclude two possible mechanistic explanations for the regrowth of the almost cleared bacteria. Neither the hypothesis of bacterial dissemination to different tissues nor a limitation of phagocyte capacity were compatible with experiment. The mathematical model predicts that Borrelia recovers from the strong initial immune response by the regrowth of an immune-resistant sub-population of the bacteria. The chronic phase appears as an equilibration of bacterial growth and adaptive immunity. This result has major implications for the development of the chronic phase of Borrelia infections as well as on potential protective clinical interventions.

Experimental Infection of Rhesus Macaques and Common Marmosets with a European Strain of West Nile Virus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				8	4						10.1371/journal.pntd.0002797				APR 2014	2014	West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that infects humans and other mammals. In some cases WNV causes severe neurological disease. During recent years, outbreaks of WNV are increasing in worldwide distribution and novel genetic variants of the virus have been detected. Although a substantial amount of data exists on WNV infections in rodent models, little is known about early events during WNV infection in primates, including humans. To gain a deeper understanding of this process, we performed experimental infections of rhesus macaques and common marmosets with a virulent European WNV strain (WNV-Ita09) and monitored virological, hematological, and biochemical parameters. WNV-Ita09 productively infected both monkey species, with higher replication and wider tissue distribution in common marmosets compared to rhesus macaques. The animals in this study however, did not develop clinical signs of WNV disease, nor showed substantial deviations in clinical laboratory parameters. In both species, the virus induced a rapid CD56(dim)CD16(bright) natural killer response, followed by IgM and IgG antibody responses. The results of this study show that healthy rhesus macaques and common marmosets are promising animal models to study WNV-Ita09 infection. Both models may be particularly of use to evaluate potential vaccine candidates or to investigate WNV pathogenesis.Author SummaryWest Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne virus that can infect mammals, including humans. Most infected humans do not develop disease, but in about 20% of cases humans develop WNV-related disease symptoms, varying in severity from fever to a sometimes life-threatening neuro-invasive disease. The number of WNV infections in Europe has increased in recent years and is caused by viruses that are genetically different from the viruses that caused the WNV epidemic in North America. In this study, we have experimentally infected two different monkey species, rhesus macaques and common marmosets, with the European WNV isolate Ita09 to evaluate the early events after infection and the onset of the disease. Both species were equally susceptible to infection with WNV-Ita09, but differences between species were observed. Compared to rhesus macaques, common marmosets had higher virus loads in blood, and presented a wider distribution of the virus in various organs. Based on the analysis of virological, immunological, biochemical and hematological parameters, we conclude that rhesus macaques as well as common marmosets are potentially useful animal models to evaluate vaccine candidates or to investigate WNV pathogenesis.

To test this hypothesis, 258 ICR mice were inoculated with HSV type 1 (KOS strain). After the induced infection, 86 mice (33.3%) died, 77 (29.8%) showed Behcet's disease-like symptoms, and 95 (36.8%) had a healthy, normal appearance or just a single symptom. The symptoms included skin ulcers on the earlobe, neck, abdomen, back or face (57.1%); eye syndromes (39.0%); partial hair loss (33.8%); genital ulcers (19.5%); bullae (11.7%); arthritis (5.2%); gastrointestinal ulcer (5.2%); and tongue ulcers (3.9%). The induced Behcet's disease-like symptoms are similar to the clinical manifestations of ulcers, uveitis, and arthritis which have been significant in diagnosing Behcet's disease in patients.

How these host responses work together to prevent virus pathogenicity, and how immune imbalance predisposes to disease, remain poorly understood. Here, we describe three ongoing lines of enquiry that are shedding new light on these issues. These focus on: (i) patients with infectious mononucleosis or its fatal equivalent, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease; (ii) EBV infection in a range of new, genetically defined, primary immune deficiency states; and (iii) experimental infection in two complementary animal models, the rhesus macaque and the human haemopoietic stem cell reconstituted mouse.

New genotypes of Liao ning virus (LNV) in Australia exhibit an insect-specific phenotype								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				99	4			596	609		10.1099/jgv.0.001038				APR 2018	2018	Liao ning virus (LNV) was first isolated in 1996 from mosquitoes in China, and has been shown to replicate in selected mammalian cell lines and to cause lethal haemorrhagic disease in experimentally infected mice. The first detection of LNV in Australia was by deep sequencing of mosquito homogenates. We subsequently isolated LNV from mosquitoes of four genera (Culex, Anopheles, Mansonia and Aedes) in New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia; the earliest of these Australian isolates were obtained from mosquitoes collected in 1988, predating the first Chinese isolates. Genetic analysis revealed that the Australian LNV isolates formed two new genotypes: one including isolates from eastern and northern Australia, and the second comprising isolates from the south-western corner of the continent. In contrast to findings reported for the Chinese LNV isolates, the Australian LNV isolates did not replicate in vertebrate cells in vitro or in vivo, or produce signs of disease in wild-type or immunodeficient mice. A panel of human and animal sera collected from regions where the virus was found in high prevalence also showed no evidence of LNV-specific antibodies. Furthermore, high rates of virus detection in progeny reared from infected adult female mosquitoes, coupled with visualization of the virus within the ovarian follicles by immunohistochemistry, suggest that LNV is transmitted transovarially. Thus, despite relatively minor genomic differences between Chinese and Australian LNV strains, the latter display a characteristic insect-specific phenotype.

New Orleans, La.								94	109						1968	1968	The short-cut methods of tissue-culture virology have not yet been successfully adapted to naturally occurring or low-dose experimental infections with the RNA tumor viruses. Further progress in the search for such agents in less artificial populations than commercially produced chickens and selectively inbred mice, will depend upon new methods for their detection, and for their propagation from natural and low-dose-induced experimental lesions. The investigation of these unique virus-host interactions represents a problem apart, and a separate subdis-cipline of general virology. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19684900100490

Experimental Infection of Potential Reservoir Hosts with Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus, Mexico								EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES				15	4			519	525		10.3201/eid1504.081008				APR 2009	2009	In 1993, an outbreak of encephalitis among 125 affected equids in coastal Chiapas, Mexico, resulted in a 50% case-fatality rate. The outbreak was attributed to Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) subtype IE, not previously associated with equine disease and death. To better understand the ecology of this VEEV strain in Chiapas, we experimentally infected 5 species of wild rodents and evaluated their competence as reservoir and amplifying hosts. Rodents from 1 species (Baiomys musculus) showed signs of disease and died by day 8 postinoculation. Rodents from the 4 other species (Liomys salvini, Oligoryzomys fulvescens, Oryzomys couesi, and Sigmodon hispidus) became viremic but survived and developed neutralizing antibodies, indicating that multiple species may contribute to VEEV maintenance. By infecting numerous rodent species and producing adequate viremia, VEEV may increase its chances of long-term persistence in nature and could increase risk for establishment in disease-endemic areas and amplification outside the disease-endemic range.

J	Van Reeth, K; Van Gucht, S; Pensaert, M								In vivo studies on cytokine involvement during acute viral respiratory disease of swine: troublesome but rewarding								VETERINARY IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOPATHOLOGY				87	3-4	SI		161	168	PII S0165-2427(02)00047-8	10.1016/S0165-2427(02)00047-8				SEP 10 2002	2002	The early cytokines interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1, -6 and -8 (IL-1, -6, -8) are produced during the most early stage of an infection. The activities of these cytokines have been studied extensively in vitro and in rodents, but in vivo studies on the role of these cytokines in infectious diseases of food animals are few. This review concentrates on in vivo studies of cytokine involvement in infectious respiratory diseases of swine, with an emphasis on viral infections. First evidence for the role of early cytokines in pneumonia in swine came from experimental infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The role of TNF-alpha and IL-1 in the symptoms and pathology of porcine pleuropneumonia has recently been proven by use of an adenovirus vector expressing the anti-inflammatory IL-10. In the authors' laboratory, studies were under-taken to investigate the relationship between viral respiratory disease and bioactive lung lavage levels of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6. Out of three respiratory viruses-porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV)-only SIV induced acute respiratory disease and severe lung damage by itself. Disease and lung pathology were tightly associated with the simultaneous production of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6. In challenge studies of SIV-vaccinated pigs, levels of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha and IL-6, but not IL-1 were correlated with clinical and virological protection. Multifactorial respiratory disease was reproduced by combined inoculations with PRCV or PRRSV followed by LPS from Escherichia coli. In comparison with the respective single inoculations, which were subclinical, there was a true potentiation of disease and production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6. TNF-alpha and IL-6 were best correlated with disease. In further studies, we will use more specific strategies to dissect the role of cytokines during viral infections. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This report shows that the MHV3 titers in the peritoneal exudate (PE) of H-III mice, 3 days after infection, were more than 2 log greater than in the resistant L(III) mice, the interferon gamma (IFN gamma) titers in the PE of both mouse populations being not significantly different. The treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells induced susceptibility among L(III) mice. The depletion of CD4(+) T-cell subset in L(III) mice was evidenced by, and led to a significant reduction in, the IFN gamma synthesis in their PEs with a 100 fold increase in MHV3 titers. When lymph node cells (LNC) were harvested from MHV3-infected mice and stimulated ''in vitro'' with MHV3 inactivated by ultraviolet radiation (uv-MHV3), only LNC from L(III) mice were capable of proliferating and synthesizing significant amounts of interleukin 2 (IL-2). The LNC proliferation and IL-2 synthesis were inhibited by treatment with mAbs against CD4 or CD8 molecules. The MHV3 infection induced in both lines of mice a profound depression of the mitogenic response of LNC to phytohemaglutinin (PHA). A correlation between the specific T-cell response and the resistance to MHV3 infection is discussed.																					WOS:A1995RK39400007	7646354

An in vitro experimental infection indicated that the chimeric CDVs possessing the H gene derived from the mouse-adapted CDV acquired infectivity for neural cells. These cells lack the CDV receptors that have been identified to date (SLAM and nectin-4), indicating that the H protein defines infectivity in various cell lines. The recombinant viruses were administered intracerebrally to 1-week-old mice. Fatal neurological signs of disease were observed only with a recombinant CDV that possessed both the H and P genes of the mouse-adapted strain, similar to the parental mouse-adapted strain, suggesting that both genes are important to drive virulence of CDV in mice. Using this recombinant CDV, we traced the intracerebral propagation of CDV by detecting EGFP. Widespread infection was observed in the cerebral hemispheres and brainstems of the infected mice. In addition, EGFP fluorescence in the brain slices demonstrated a sequential infectious progression in the central nervous system: CDV primarily infected the neuroependymal cells lining the ventricular wall and the neurons of the hippocampus and cortex adjacent to the ventricle, and it then progressed to an extensive infection of the brain surface, followed by the parenchyma and cortex. In the hippocampal formation, CDV spread in a unidirectional retrograde pattern along neuronal processes in the hippocampal formation from the CA1 region to the CA3 region and the dentate gyrus. Our mouse model demonstrated that the main target cells of CDV are neurons in the acute phase and that the virus spreads via neuronal transmission pathways in the hippocampal formation.IMPORTANCECDV is the etiological agent of distemper in dogs and other carnivores, and in many respects, the pathogenesis of CDV infection in animals resembles that of measles virus infection in humans. We successfully generated a recombinant CDV containing the H and P genes from a mouse-adapted neurovirulent strain and expressing EGFP. The recombinant CDV exhibited severe neuro-virulence with high mortality, comparable to the parental mouse-adapted strain. The mouse-infectious model could become a useful tool for analyzing CDV infection of the central nervous system subsequent to passing through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier and infectious progression in the target cells in acute disease.

Out of 18 female rats who nursed the infected young, 5 fell ill and died during the course of 10-26 days. The disease became apparent among the young rats 2-6 days before the beginning of the illnesses in the females who were nursing them. Histologically, degenerative and inflammatory changes were detected in the brains of the infected females, along with hyperplasia and focal necrosis in the glands of the mesentery. In 2 of the rats which were examined, virus was isolated from the brain, and in one case from the glands of the mesentery. The remaining 13 femeles were sacrificed after 3 months of observation. Histologically, lesions of the central nervous system characteristic of poliomyelitis were detected in 8 of these. In another series of experiments, 3 healthy rats were added to 10 perorally-infected 4-5 week old rats on the 1st, 7th and 21st day after infection. The contact lasted for 3 days. Poliomyelitis virus was isolated from the excreta of the experimentally infected rats and 2 of the rats became ill. In the rats exposed to the infected rats on the 1st and 7th day, histological examination revealed changes which were characteristic of poliomyelitis. One of these exposed rats developed the paralytic disease. The rats who were exposed on the 21st day were clinically healthy after 3 months and were then killed. The author considers that the transfer of virus to the exposed rats took place via the excreta of the experimentally infected rats.																					BCI:BCI19583200013093

CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice were quickly depleted of CD4(+) thymocytes and both CD45RA(+) naive and CD45RA(-) memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes, while CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice were preferentially depleted of CD45RA(-) memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Staining of HIV-1 p24 antigen revealed that CCR5-tropic HIV-1 preferentially infected effector memory T lymphocytes (T-EM) rather than central memory T lymphocytes. In addition, the majority of p24(+) cells in CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice were activated and in cycling phase. Taken together, Our findings indicate that productive infection mainly takes place in the activated T-EM in cycling phase and further suggest that the predominant infection in T-EM Would lead to the depletion of memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes in CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice.

Experimental studies suggest a lethal synergism between influenza and certain bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae, but the precise processes involved are unclear. To address the mechanisms and determine the influences of pathogen dose and strain on disease, we infected groups of mice with either the H1N1 subtype influenza A virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) or a version expressing the 1918 PB1-F2 protein (PR8-PB1-F2(1918)), followed seven days later with one of two S. pneumoniae strains, type 2 D39 or type 3 A66.1. We determined that, following bacterial infection, viral titers initially rebound and then decline slowly. Bacterial titers rapidly rise to high levels and remain elevated. We used a kinetic model to explore the coupled interactions and study the dominant controlling mechanisms. We hypothesize that viral titers rebound in the presence of bacteria due to enhanced viral release from infected cells, and that bacterial titers increase due to alveolar macrophage impairment. Dynamics are affected by initial bacterial dose but not by the expression of the influenza 1918 PB1-F2 protein. Our model provides a framework to investigate pathogen interaction during coinfections and to uncover dynamical differences based on inoculum size and strain.

Changes in influenza virus associated with adaptation to passage in chick embryos								AUSTRAL JOUR EXP BIOL AND MED SCI				21	(2)			55	69		10.1038/icb.1943.7				1943	1943	Strains of influenza virus A isolated in the Victorian epidemic of May 1942 have shown a uniform change in character on passage in chick embryos. The original (O) form is obtainable in the amniotic fluid of embryos inoculated with infective human filtrates. If passage is made without special precautions a derivative (D) form replaces the O form within 1-2 passages. The forms differ in 2 main characteristics. (1) Hemagglutination tests show with O forms a much higher titre with guinea pig than with fowl red cells. D forms agglutinate both types of cell to similar titres. (2) The 0 form will not induce infection when inoculated into the allantoic cavity; strains in the D form readily do so. Other minor points of difference concern the range of red cell species agglutinated, the ability to immunize mice when administered intranasally and the susceptibility of the 2 forms to inhibition by human tears in hemagglutination tests. There are slight serol. differences between the 2 forms. When an amniotic fluid containing O virus is titrated in serial dilutions inoculated amniotically in chick embryos, the higher dilutions only give rise to O-type fluids, lower dilutions give D-type virus. The results of such "titration-passages" are considered to prove that the 0 to D change is a discontinuous mutation. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: F. M. Burnet																					BCI:BCI19441800001219

We found that H9N2 viruses from North America differ from those of Asia. The North American viruses, which infect primarily domestic turkeys, replicated poorly in inoculated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein genes indicated that the Asian H9N2 influenza viruses could he divided into three sublineages. Initial biological characterization of at least one virus from each lineage was done in animals. Early isolates of one lineage (A/Chicken/Beijing/1/94, H9N2) caused as high as 80% mortality rates in inoculated chickens, whereas all other strains were nonpathogenic. Sequence analysis showed that some isolates, including the pathogenic isolate, had one additional basic amino acid (A-R/K-S-S-R-) at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Later isolates of the same lineage (A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97, H9N2) that contains the PB1 and PB2 genes similar to Hong Kong/97 H5N1 viruses replicated in chickens, ducks, mice, and pigs but were pathogenic only in mice. A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2), from a second lineage that possesses the replicative complex similar to Hong Kong/97 H5N1 virus, replicated in chickens and ducks without producing disease signs, was pathogenic in mice, and spread to the brain without adaptation. Examples of the third Asian H9N2 sublineage (A/Chicken/Korea/323/96, Duck/Hong Kong/Y439/97) replicated in chickens, ducks, and mice without producing disease signs. The available evidence supports the notion of differences in pathogenicity of H9N2 viruses in the different lineages and suggests that viruses possessing genome segments similar to 1997 H5N1-like viruses are potentially pathogenic in mammals.

Bovine adenovirus type-1 (BAdV-1) is one of the common bovine viral pathogens. For quantitative detection of BAdV-1 during the manufacture of biologics and medical devices, a TaqMan probe real-time PCR method was developed. Specific primers and TaqMan probe for amplifying and detecting BAdV-1 DNA were designed.Specificity, limit of detection (LOD), and robustness of the method was validated according to international guideline on the validation of nucleic acid amplification tests for the pathogen detection. The sensitivity of the assay was found to be 7.44 × 101 TCID50/ml. The real-time PCR method was reproducible, very specific to BAdV-1, and robust. Moreover, the method was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-K1 cells artificially infected with BAdV-1, a commercial CHO master bank, and bovine type 1 collagen. The overall results indicate that this rapid, specific, sensitive, and robust assay can be reliably used for quantitative detection of BAdV-1 contamination during the manufacture of biologics and medical devices using bovine-derived raw materials.				소의 혈액, 세포, 조직, 기관 등이 생물의약품, 조직공학제제, 세포치료제, 의료기기의 원재료로 널리 사용되고 있다. 소유래 성분 원재료에 다양한 바이러스가 오염된 사례가 있기때문에 소유래 물질을 원재료로 사용한 제제의 바이러스 안전성 검증이 필수적으로 요구된다.

BMC Infectious Diseases				14	276			(20 May 2014)	(20 May 2014)						2014	2014	Background: Early differential diagnosis between acute bacterial and viral meningitis is problematic. We aimed to investigate whether the detection of lipocalin 2, a protein of the acute innate immunity response, may be used as a marker for acute bacterial meningitis. Methods: Transgenic mice expressing the human transferrin were infected by intraperitoneal route and were imaged. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was sampled up to 48 hours post- infection to measure lipocalin 2. We also tested a collection of 90 and 44 human CSF with confirmed acute bacterial or acute viral meningitis respectively. Results: Lipocalin 2 was detected after 5 h in CSF during experimental infection in mice. Lipocalin 2 levels were significantly higher (p<0.0001) in patients with confirmed acute bacterial meningitis (mean 125 pg/mL, range 106-145 pg/mL) than in patients with acute viral meningitis (mean 2 pg/mL, range 0-6 pg/mL) with a sensitivity of 81%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 71% in diagnosing acute bacterial meningitis. Conclusions: Increased levels of lipocalin 2 in cerebrospinal fluid may discriminate between acute bacterial and viral meningitis in patients with clinical syndrome of meningitis.

The liver, spleen, kidney, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon of each mouse from all three groups were collected for reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) detection, indirect immunofluorescence observation and histopathologic examination. The sera from nude mice were tested for anti-HEV IgG by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Activities of liver enzymes, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), as well as total bilirubin (TBIL) were also measured in the sera of the nude mice.Results: HEV antigens and HEV RNA were detected in liver, spleen, kidney, jejunum, ileum and colon both by indirect immunofluorescence and by RT-nPCR in all of the inoculated and in one of the contact-exposed nude mice. Histopathological changes were observed in the liver and spleen of these mice. Infected mice showed increased levels of AST, ALP, and anti-HEV IgG in sera. The livers of contact-exposed mice showed obvious histopathological damage.Conclusion: Nude mice could be readily infected by HEV isolated from pigs. The nude mouse may therefore be a useful animal model for studying the pathogenesis of HEV.																					WOS:000268568100001	19523236

BMC Infectious Diseases				9	93			(13 June 2009)	(13 June 2009)						2009	2009	Background: Several animal species can reportedly act as reservoirs for Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a zoonotic pathogen. HEV and antibody to the virus have been detected in a variety of animals including rodents. Pig and rat models for HEV have been established for HEV, but a nude mouse has not yet been developed. Methods: Balb/c nude mice were inoculated with swine HEV, both orally and via intravenous injection to insure infection. Negative control and experimental contact-exposed groups of mice were also included in the study. The liver, spleen, kidney, jejunum, ileum, cecum and colon of each mouse from all three groups were collected for reverse transcription nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) detection, indirect immunofluorescence observation and histopathologic examination.

An estimated 500,000 cases of Oropouche fever have occurred in Brazil in the last 30 years, with recorded cases also in Panama, Peru, Suriname and Trinidad. We have developed an experimental model of Oropouche virus infection in neonatal BALB/c mouse by subcutaneous inoculation. The vast majority of infected animals developed disease on the 5th day post infection, characterized mainly by lethargy and paralysis, progressing to death within 10 days. Viral replication was documented in brain cells by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and virus titration. Multi-step immunohistochemistry indicated neurons as the main target cells of OROV infection. Histopathology revealed glial reaction and astrocyte activation in the brain and spinal cord, with neuronal apoptosis. Spleen hyperplasia and mild meningitis were also found, without viable virus detected in liver and spleen. This is the first report of an experimental mouse model of OROV infection, with severe involvement of the central nervous system, and should become useful in pathogenesis studies, as well as in preclinical testing of therapeutic interventions for this emerging pathogen.

Similarities between the intrauterine alterations induced by Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus and rubella virus are pointed out. Findings described by Wenger in 1967 were those of massive cerebral necrosis in fetuses of women presumably suffering of encephalitis and they are commented along with the development of an animal experimental model at the end of 1970- 1980. Pathogenesis of the intrauterine infection seemed to be related to changes in the placental vessels, vascular changes in the central nervous system were also described in rats surviving Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis experimental infection; similar changes were described in the brain of children with post rubella syndrome. The need for multidisciplinary studies in the endemic areas of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis in order to detect secuelae of the viral effects in utero is emphasized. Finally, some experimental animal models are proposed to examine diverse aspects on intrauterine effect of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus.																					WOS:A1992JY08600005	1457535

Greater than 90% of all deaths from influenza A virus (IAV) occur in the elderly (>65 years of age). To address this age-related susceptibility to SARS-CoV and IAV, we infected C57BL/6 (B6) mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (MA15) or IAV (PR8), both of which cause severe disease in aged mice. Intranasal pretreatment of aged mice with poly(I.C) (a TLR3 agonist) and, to a lesser extent, CpG, R848, or lipopolysaccharide (TLR9, TLR7/8, or TLR4 agonists), provided a high level of protection [90% to 100% survival rate after poly(I.C) treatment] against lethal MA15 or IAV challenge and reduced pathological changes and virus loads in the lungs at early times after infection. Poly(I.C) pretreatment upregulated beta interferon (IFN-beta), IFN-gamma, IL-1 beta, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene expression in the lungs. Intranasal pretreatment with IFN-beta or IFN-gamma but not IL-1 beta or TNF also protected aged mice, consistent with the notion that poly(I.C) pretreatment functioned, at least in part, by inducing IFN-beta and IFN-gamma. We also identified a potential cellular target for poly(I.C) by showing that treatment inhibited virus replication in primary human airway epithelial cells. These results suggest that intranasal poly(I.C) should be evaluated as a prophylactic agent in aged individuals at high risk for contracting SARS-CoV or IAV infections.

M.; Nikolich-Zugich, Janko								Quantitative restoration of immune defense in old animals determined by naive antigen-specific CD8 T-cell numbers								AGING CELL										e13582	10.1111/acel.13582		MAR 2022			2022	Older humans and animals often exhibit reduced immune responses to infection and vaccination, and this often directly correlates to the numbers and frequency of naive T (Tn) cells. We found such a correlation between reduced numbers of blood CD8+ Tn cells and severe clinical outcomes of West Nile virus (WNV) in both humans naturally exposed to, and mice experimentally infected with, WNV. To examine possible causality, we sought to increase the number of CD8 Tn cells by treating C57BL/6 mice with IL-7 complexes (IL-7C, anti-IL-7 mAb bound to IL-7), shown previously to efficiently increase peripheral T-cell numbers by homeostatic proliferation. T cells underwent robust expansion following IL-7C administration to old mice increasing the number of total T cells (>fourfold) and NS4b:H-2D(b)-restricted antigen-specific CD8 T cells (twofold). This improved the numbers of NS4b-specific CD8 T cells detected at the peak of the response against WNV, but not survival of WNV challenge. IL-7C-treated old animals also showed no improvement in WNV-specific effector immunity (neutralizing antibody and in vivo T-cell cytotoxicity). To test quantitative limits to which CD8 Tn cell restoration could improve protective immunity, we transferred graded doses of Ag-specific precursors into old mice and showed that injection of 5400 (but not of 1800 or 600) adult naive WNV-specific CD8 T cells significantly increased survival after WNV. These results set quantitative limits to the level of Tn reconstitution necessary to improve immune defense in older organisms and are discussed in light of targets of immune reconstitution.

Manufacturing processes for the biologics have the risk of viral contamination. Therefore viral validation is essential in ensuring the safety of the products. Bovine parvovirus (BPV) is one of the common bovine pathogens and has widely been known as a possible contaminant of biologics. In order to establish the validation system for the BPV safety of biologics, a real-time PCR method was developed for quantitative detection of BPV contamination in raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products. Specific primers for amplification of BPV DNA were selected, and BPV DNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green 1. The sensitivity of the assay was caculated to be 1.3 x 10(-1) TCID50/mL. The real-time PCR method was validated to be reproducible and very specific to BPV. The established real-time PCR assay was Successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with BPV. BPV DNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culture supernatant. Also the real-time PCR assay Could detect 1.3 x 10(0) TCID50/mL of BPV artificially contaminated in bovine collagen. The overall results indicated that this rapid, specific, sensitive, and robust assay can be reliably used for quantitative detection of BPV contamination during manufacture of biologics.

The combined roles of these two receptor families in the course of experimental infections have been assessed in MyD88- and IRAK-4-deficient mice for almost fifteen years. These animals have been shown to be susceptible to 46 pathogens: 27 bacteria, eight viruses, seven parasites, and four fungi. Humans with inborn MyD88 or IRAK-4 deficiency were first identified in 2003. They suffer from naturally occurring life-threatening infections caused by a small number of bacterial species, although the incidence and severity of these infections decrease with age. Mouse TLR- and IL-1R-dependent immunity mediated by MyD88 and IRAK-4 seems to be vital to combat a wide array of experimentally administered pathogens at most ages. By contrast, human TLR- and IL-1R-dependent immunity mediated by MyD88 and IRAK-4 seems to be effective in the natural setting against only a few bacteria and is most important in infancy and early childhood. The roles of TLRs and IL-1Rs in protective immunity deduced from studies in mutant mice subjected to experimental infections should therefore be reconsidered in the light of findings for natural infections in humans carrying mutations as discussed in this review.

Vaccinia Virus Uses Retromer-Independent Cellular Retrograde Transport Pathways To Facilitate the Wrapping of Intracellular Mature Virions during Virus Morphogenesis								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				90	22			10120	10132		10.1128/JVI.01464-16				NOV 2016	2016	Poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus (VACV), undertake a complex cytoplasmic replication cycle which involves morphogenesis through four distinct virion forms and includes a crucial wrapping step whereby intracellular mature virions (IMVs) are wrapped in two additional membranes to form intracellular enveloped virions (IEVs). To determine if cellular retrograde transport pathways are required for this wrapping step, we examined VACV morphogenesis in cells with reduced expression of the tetrameric tethering factor known as the GARP (Golgi-associated retrograde pathway), a central component of retrograde transport. VACV multistep replication was significantly impaired in cells transfected with small interfering RNA targeting the GARP complex and in cells with a mutated GARP complex. Detailed analysis revealed that depletion of the GARP complex resulted in a reduction in the number of IEVs, thereby linking retrograde transport with the wrapping of IMVs. In addition, foci of viral wrapping membrane proteins without an associated internal core accumulated in cells with a mutated GARP complex, suggesting that impaired retrograde transport uncouples nascent IMVs from the IEV membranes at the site of wrapping. Finally, small-molecule inhibitors of retrograde transport strongly suppressed VACV multistep growth in vitro and reduced weight loss and clinical signs in an in vivo murine model of systemic poxviral disease. This work links cellular retrograde transport pathways with the morphogenesis of poxviruses and identifies a panel of novel inhibitors of poxvirus replication.IMPORTANCE Cellular retrograde transport pathways traffic cargo from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network and are a key part of the intracellular membrane network. This work reveals that the prototypic poxvirus vaccinia virus (VACV) exploits cellular retrograde transport pathways to facilitate the wrapping of intracellular mature virions and therefore promote the production of extracellular virus. Inhibition of retrograde transport by small-molecule inhibitors reduced the replication of VACV in cell culture and alleviated disease in mice experimentally infected with VACV. This research provides fundamental new knowledge about the wrapping step of poxvirus morphogenesis, furthers our knowledge of the complex cellular retrograde pathways, and identifies a new group of antipoxvirus drugs.

Clinically, all animals inoculated by the nasal route and similar to 25% inoculated by the oral and peritoneal routes showed neurological signs on days 3, 6, and 9 postinoculation (PI), respectively. Neurological signs were not observed in animals administered EHV-9 by the IV and ocular routes. With the exception of animals administered EHV-9 by the IV route, all infected animals had lymphocytic meningoencephalitis. Although there were a number of differences in the severity and distribution of the lesions depending on the route of inoculation, the basic features of lymphocytic meningoencephalitis caused by EHV-9 were common. Lesions consisted of neuronal necrosis, perivascular aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils, gliosis, intranuclear inclusion bodies, and diffuse lymphocytic infiltrates in the meninges. Viral antigen was detected in degenerated neurons in infected animals inoculated by the nasal, ocular, oral, and peritoneal routes. The distribution of EHV-9 antigen was somewhat dependent on inoculation route. There were no microscopic abnormalities or viral antigen in animals treated by the IV route. This study provides new data about experimental EHV-9 infection in hamsters through routes other than the IV route. These results suggest that in the animals infected by the oral, ocular, and peritoneal routes, EHV-9 might travel to the brain through nerves, other than by the olfactory route, after initial propagation at the site of viral entry.

The mechanisms that underlie the age-dependent risk for IPF are unknown. Based on studies that suggest an association of IPF and gamma herpesvirus infection, we infected young (2-3 mo) and old (>= 18 mo) C57BL/6 mice with the murine gamma herpesvirus 68. Acute murine gamma herpesvirus 68 infection in aging mice resulted in severe pneumonitis and fibrosis compared with young animals. Progressive clinical deterioration and lung fibrosis in the late chronic phase of infection was observed exclusively in old mice with diminution of tidal volume. Infected aging mice showed higher expression of transforming growth factor-beta during the acute phase of infection. In addition, aging, infected mice showed elevation of proinflammatory cytokines and the fibrocyte recruitment chemokine, CXCL12, in bronchoalveolar lavage. Analyses of lytic virus infection and virus reactivation indicate that old mice were able to control chronic infection and elicit antivirus immune responses. However, old, infected mice showed a significant increase in apoptotic responses determined by in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay, levels of caspase-3, and expression of the proapoptotitc molecule, Bcl-2 interacting mediator. Apoptosis of type II lung epithelial cells in aging lungs was accompanied by up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, binding immunoglobulin protein, and splicing of X-box-binding protein 1. These results indicate that the aging lung is more susceptible to injury and fibrosis associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis of type II lung epithelial cells, and activation of profibrotic pathways.

This neurotropic, negative and single-stranded enveloped RNA virus spreads via axonal and transsynaptic pathways quite specifically into olfactoric and limbic structures. The symptoms in BDV-infected animals range from unapparent or subtle clinical manifestations to fatal neurological disorders. The severe and fulminant course of the infection, which is often accompanied by neurobehavioral and "emotional" disturbances, occurs sporadically and, at least in experimentally infected animals (rats), is thought to be mediated by immunopathology. Increases in serum-BDV antibodies have also been detected in neuropsychiatric patients. In addition, viral antigen and viral RNA have been observed in acutely ill major depressive patients, leading to the conclusion that BDV was causally related to psychiatric disorders, in particular to affective disorders. A number of studies have meanwhile furnished evidence of abnormal immune functions in mentally ill patients. In addition, stress has been shown to decrease immune responses to viral infections. On the basis of these findings it is hypothesized that human BDV infection represents a co-factor in the development or course of psychiatric diseases. Stress may cause immunosuppression and thus induce activation of persisting BDV in the limbic system, resulting in an inflammatory reaction of these structures. These neuropathological changes might influence the serotonergic or dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. In addition, a specific affinity of BDV structural elements for aspartate and glutamate receptors in the hippocampal formation might directly induce an imbalance of these transmitter system interactions, causing affective and behavioral disturbances. The possible interactions between stress-induced immunosuppression, BDV infection and affective disorders in humans, and the theoretical and clinical aspects of this concept are discussed.

Two mAbs each were obtained for the HeV N and NiV N, respectively. All four mAbs displayed specific reactivity with the recombinant N proteins of both viruses by western blot, which was further confirmed by immunofluorescent antibody assay using fixed insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses expressing either the HeV or NiV N protein. Epitope mapping using a 12-mer random peptide phage display library revealed two linear antigenic sites of the henipavirus N proteins, KLxR (aa 17-20) and FKREM (aa 446-450), which have not been reported previously. Two of the mAbs were able to specifically recognize HeV antigens by immunohistochemical staining of lung tissue sections of a horse experimentally infected with HeV.

A novel challenge model to evaluate the efficacy of hepatitis C virus vaccines in mice								VACCINE				32	27			3409	3416		10.1016/j.vaccine.2014.04.014				JUN 5 2014	2014	An effective hepatitis C virus (HCV) vaccine should elicit robust humoral and cell mediated immunity (CMI). A small animal challenge model is required to assess the efficacy of vaccines which elicit CMI. In this study, HCV proteins were expressed in hepatocytes of immunocompetent mice after hydrodynamic injection of a plasmid encoding the HCV NS3/4A protein. This vector, constructed as the "challenge", was optimized for long term, specific gene expression in hepatocytes. To monitor HCV antigen expression in transfected hepatocytes, the plasmid also encoded secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP), which was detected in the mouse serum. The design of this novel challenge plasmid was based on studies using luciferase and SEAP as reporter molecules to examine the kinetics of the proteins expressed in hepatocytes and secreted into blood. We designed two constructs to control SEAP expression. In one construct, SEAP expression was controlled by the EMCV IRES, while in the other, a SEAP and luciferase polyprotein was cleaved by the FMDV2A proteinase. We found that SEAP expressed after FMDV2A self cleavage was more sensitive and showed a higher correlation with luciferase expressed in liver. The NSIMA challenge model using the FMDV2A design provided a window period of 50 days to monitor changes in SEAP expression after hydrodynamic injection of DNA. In a challenge experiment, mice which received an adenovirus-based HCV vaccine showed accelerated clearance of SEAP and thus, of NS3/4A positive hepatocytes compared with a mock vaccinated group, that coincided with an increased number of CD8(+) lymphocytes in the liver.

The present study examines the outcome of an experimental EHDV-7 infection of Holstein cattle and East Frisian sheep. Apart from na ve animals that had not been exposed to BTV, it included animals that had been experimentally infected with either BTV-6 or BTV-8 two months earlier. In addition, EHDV-infected cattle were subsequently challenged with BTV-8.Samples were tested with commercially available ELISA and real-time RT-PCR kits and a custom NS3-specific real-time RT-PCR assay. Virus isolation was attempted in Vero, C6/36 and KC cells (from Culicoides variipennis), embryonated chicken eggs and type I interferon receptor-deficient IFNAR-I- mice.EHDV-7 productively infected Holstein cattle, but caused no clinical signs. The inoculation of East Frisian sheep, on the other hand, apparently did not lead to a productive infection. The commercial diagnostic kits performed adequately. KC cells proved to be the most sensitive means of virus isolation, but viremia was shorter than 2 weeks in most animals. No interference between EHDV and BTV infection was observed; therefore the pre-existing immunity to some BTV serotypes in Europe is not expected to protect against a possible introduction of EHDV, in spite of the close relation between the viruses.

Normal rat joints were enzymatically digested and single cell suspensions obtained. Control cells included human RA synovial fibroblasts and endothelial cells. We infected cells with an adenoviral vector bearing the lacZ marker gene, encoding beta-galactosidase (gal), under the control of the chicken beta actin promotor and the cytomegalovirus enhancer. To examine in vivo gene delivery, we infected non-arthritic and arthritic female Lewis rats ankles intra-articularly with, AxCAlacZ (1 X 10(10) PFU/joint). Control rats were sham injected. Rat joints were embedded in OCT and cryosections prepared and examined for the ability to express gal. In ex vivo experiments, twenty four hours after AxCAlacZ injection at MOI 5 compared to sham injected cells, the majority of virally infected synovial cells expressed gal while sham infected rat cells did not. In in vivo experiments, normal or AIA rats were sacrified at 0 to 28 days after infection. In virally infected animals. gal expression was visible grossly in the intra-articular space. Gal was detected histologically, particularly in the synovial lining layer, up to 28 days post-viral infection. In normal rats injected with AxCAlacZ, no inflammatory synovial infiltrates were noted during this time period. These results indicate that rodent models such as AIA may serve as useful models in which to conduct both ex vivo and in vivo experimental gene therapy trials.

Immune Predictors of Mortality After Ribonucleic Acid Virus Infection								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				221	6			882	889		10.1093/infdis/jiz531				MAR 15 2020	2020	Background. Virus infections result in a range of clinical outcomes for the host, from asymptomatic to severe or even lethal disease. Despite global efforts to prevent and treat virus infections to limit morbidity and mortality, the continued emergence and re-emergence of new outbreaks as well as common infections such as influenza persist as a health threat. Challenges to the prevention of severe disease after virus infection include both a paucity of protective vaccines as well as the early identification of individuals with the highest risk that may require supportive treatment.Methods. We completed a screen of mice from the Collaborative Cross (CC) that we infected with influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, and West Nile virus.Results. The CC mice exhibited a range of disease manifestations upon infections, and we used this natural variation to identify strains with mortality after infection and strains exhibiting no mortality. We then used comprehensive preinfection immunophenotyping to identify global baseline immune correlates of protection from mortality to virus infection.Conclusions. These data suggest that immune phenotypes might be leveraged to identify humans at highest risk of adverse clinical outcomes upon infection, who may most benefit from intensive clinical interventions, in addition to providing insight for rational vaccine design.

The complete genome of avian HEV contains three open-reading frames (ORFs) in which ORF2 protein is part of virus particles and thus contains primary epitopes. Antigenic epitopes of avian HEV ORF2 protein have been described but those associated with the ORF3 have not. To analyze the antigenic domains and epitopes in the ORF3 protein of a Chinese isolate of avian FIEV (CaHEV), we generated a series of antigens comprised of the complete ORF3 and also five truncated overlapping ORF3 peptides. The antibodies used in this study were mouse antisera and monoclonal antibodies against ORF3, positive chicken sera from Specific Pathogen Free chickens experimentally infected with CaHEV and clinical chicken sera. Using these antigens and antibodies, we identified three antigenic domains at amino acids (aa) 1-28,55-74 and 75-88 in which aa 75-88 was a dominant domain. The dominant domain contained at least two major epitopes since field chickens infected with avian HEV produced antibodies against the domain and epitopes. These results provide useful information for future development of immunoassays for the diagnosis of avian HEV infection. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The recent licensing of a dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) developed by Sanofi has brought to the fore the safety issue of vaccine-induced infection enhancement. Areas covered: This article focuses on two new yeast-produced tetravalent dengue envelope domain III-displaying virus-like particulate vaccine candidates reported in early 2018 and reviews the rationale underlying their design, and pre-clinical data which suggest that these may offer promising alternate options. Expert commentary: These are the only vaccine candidates so far to have demonstrated the induction of primarily serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies to all dengue virus serotypes in experimental animals. Interestingly, these antibodies lack infection-enhancing potential when evaluated using the AG129 mouse model.																					WOS:000458848700001	30587054

J	Bae, Eun Hye; Park, Sung-Han; Jung, Yong-Tae								Role of a third extracellular domain of an ecotropic receptor in Moloney murine leukemia virus infection								JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				44	4			447	452						AUG 2006	2006	The murine ecotropic retroviral receptor has been demonstrated to function as a mouse cationic amino acid transporter 1 (mCAT1), and is comprised of multiple membrane-spanning domains. Feral mouse (Mus dunni) cells are not susceptible to infection by the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), although they can be infected by other ecotropic murine leukemia viruses, including Friend MLV and Rauscher MLV. The relative inability of MoMLV to replicate in M. dunni cells has been attributed to two amino acids (V-214 and G(236)) located within the third extracellular loop of the M. dunni CATI receptor (dCAT1). Via the exchange of the third extracellular loop of the mCAT1 cDNA encoding receptor from the permissive mouse and the corresponding portion of cDNA encoding for the nonpermissive M. dunni receptor, we have identified the most critical amino acid residue, which is a glycine located at position 236 within the third extracellular loop of dCAT1.We also attempted to determine the role of the third extracellular loop of the M. dunni CATI receptor with regard to the formation of the syncytium. The relationship between dCAT1 and virus-induced syncytia was suggested initially by our previous identification of two MLV isolates (S82F in Moloney and S84A in Friend MLV), both of which are uniquely cytopathic in M. dunni cells. In an attempt to determine the relationship existing between dCAT1 and the virally-induced syncytia, we infected 293-dCAT1 or chimeric dCAT1 cells with the S82F pseudotype virus. The S82F pseudotype virus did not induce the formation of syncytia, but did show increased susceptibility to 293 cells expressing dCAT1. The results of our study indicate that S82F-induced syncytium formation may be the result of cell-cell fusion, but not virus-cell fusion.																					WOS:000240266700011	16953181

THE RAT NEURON-SPECIFIC ENOLASE PROMOTER								VIRUS RESEARCH				35	1			81	89		10.1016/0168-1702(94)00083-O				JAN 1995	1995	Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) can transduce genes into non-proliferating cells such as neurons that are refractory to other means of gene transfer. We have been interested to examine the potential usefulness of HSV-1 as a gene transfer vehicle to analyze neuron-specific regulatory sequences. In this study, we have used a replication-defective HSV-1-based vector deleted for the essential immediate early gene 3 (IE3) to transduce a 1.8 kb promoter fragment from the rat neuron-specific enolase gene (nse) linked to the firefly luciferase reporter gene (luc). It has previously been shown that the same promoter fragment is capable of directing neuron-specific expression of a linked reporter gene in transgenic mice. As an internal control for infection and gene expression, we also inserted the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene driven by the SV40 early promoter/enhancer into the thymidine kinase locus of the same vector. We infected (i) non-neuronal BHK-C13 cells which do not express the endogenous nse gene, (ii) differentiated and non-differentiated pheochromocytoma PC12 cells as well as (iii) N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells, all of which do express endogenous nse. All three cell types produced luciferase upon infection, indicating that the same nse promoter fragment that has previously been shown to be regulated in a cell-specific manner in transgenic mice, was not regulated cell type-specifically in the context of the HSV-1 genome. Therefore, the nse promoter fragment may either be incomplete (and genomic sequences in the transgenic mice may have compensated for this deficiency), or the function of the present control elements is affected by adjacent HSV sequences and is thus template-dependent.

J	Byrne, SN; Halliday, GM; Johnston, LJ; King, NJC								Interleukin-1 beta but not tumor necrosis factor is involved in West Nile Virus-induced Langerhans cell migration from the skin in C57BL/6 mice								JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE DERMATOLOGY				117	3			702	709		10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01454.x				SEP 2001	2001	Langerhans cells are bone marrow-derived epidermal dendritic cells. They migrate out of the epidermis into the lymphatics and travel to the draining lymph nodes where they are responsible for the activation of T cells in the primary immune response. Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-1 beta, have previously been shown to be responsible for Langerhans cell migration in response to contact sensitizers in BALB/C mice; however, which cytokines are responsible for mediating Langerhans cell migration in response to a replicating cutaneously acquired virus such as the West Nile Virus, are not known. We have devised a method for identifying Langerhans cells in the draining lymph nodes using E-cadherin labeling and flow cytometry. We infected tumor necrosis factor-deficient gene knockout mice (tumor necrosis factor(-/-)) intradermally with West Nile Virus and found that levels of Langerhans cell emigration and accumulation in the draining lymph nodes were similar to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. This was borne out by the finding that high levels of systemic neutralizing anti-tumor necrosis factor antibody failed to inhibit the migration of Langerhans cells from the epidermis and their accumulation in the draining lymph nodes in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In West Nile Virus-infected, tumor necrosis factor(-/-) mice treated with systemic neutralizing anti-interleuldn-1 beta antibodies, however, migration of Langerhans cells from the epidermis and their accumulation in the draining lymph nodes were significantly inhibited compared with control antibody-treated, infected animals. The results indicate that Langerhans cell migration, accumulation in the draining lymph nodes and the initiation of lymph node shut-down in response to a cutaneous West Nile Virus infection is dependent on interleukin-1 beta and can occur in the absence of tumor necrosis factor.

Clinical Course and Pathology in Rats (Rattus norvegicus) After Experimental Cowpox Virus Infection by Percutaneous and Intranasal Application								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				49	6			941	949		10.1177/0300985812439077				NOV 2012	2012	Recently, several cases of human cowpox virus (CPXV) infections were reported in France and Germany, which had been acquired through close contact with infected pet rats. The animals exhibited respiratory signs or skin lesions and died shortly after purchase. After natural infection of white rats with CPXV in the USSR in 1978, a peracute pulmonary form, a milder dermal form, and a mixed form exhibiting features of both have been described. To the best of the authors' knowledge, 3 experimental cowpox virus infection studies using rats have been performed to date; however, neither results of histomorphological examinations nor immunohistochemical analyses have yet been reported in rats after experimental infections. To investigate the impact of the infection route on the clinical course, the development of lesions, and tropism, rats were infected intradermally, intranasally, or by a combination of both routes. The authors found a correlation between clinical manifestation, pathology, and infection routes. Intradermal and contact exposure yielded a mild dermal form, characterized by the development of vesiculopustular dermatitis. In contrast, intranasally infected animals died peracutely, showing severe dyspnea. Occasionally, a combination of the dermal and the respiratory form occurred after intranasal infection. Immunohistochemically, CPXV antigen was detected in the epithelial and mesenchymal cells of the upper respiratory tract and affected skin lesions and rarely in mesenchymal cells of lymph nodes. This is the first histomorphological and immunohistochemical analysis of CPXV in rats after experimental infection.																					WOS:000310853200008	22411549	
J	PETRISHCHEVA, P. A.; SHUBLADZE, A. K.								The Vectors of the Autumn Encephalitis in the Maritime District.								Arch. Sci. biol.				59	pt. 1-2			72	77						1940	1940	In view of the fact that the virus of autumn encephalitis in the Maritime Province of the Russian Far East had been isolated from unidentified mosquitos, an extensive attempt to ascertain the vectors there was undertaken in 1939. Lists are given of the species studied in the various phases of the investigation. About 51, 000 mosquitos belonging to 11 species were taken in foci of the disease and suspensions of them were injected intranasally into mice. The only species found infected were Culex pipiens, L., and C. tritaeniorhynchus, Giles; the infective batch of the former had been taken while attacking workmen 30 days before the first cases of the disease occurred (mid-September) and that of the latter, all of which were engorged, were collected on a horse 8 days after the occurrence of the first case of encephalitis in the locality. No infection was detected in over 20, 000 mosquitos caught in rooms of encephalitic patients; these included C. pipiens and C. tritaeniorhynchus, but consisted chiefly of Ae'desspp., of which A. dorsalis, Mg., represented 70 per cent.In laboratory experiments with Anopheles maculipennis var. messeae, Fini., and C. pipiens taken in hibernation quarters near Moscow, the virus was preserved hrboth species for 14-17 days. Similar experiments were made in the Maritime Province with nearly 11, 000 mosquitos belonging to 18 species, most of which were abundant in the foci of the disease. These mosquitos were bred or collected under conditions that excluded the possibility of natural infection, and were fed on a 10 per cent, suspension of the brains of infected mice, and in many instances also allowed to engorge on infected mice. Suspensions of the mosquitos were then inoculated into mice, and infection was thus demonstrated in 4 batches out of 7 of Aedesjaponicus, Theo., 2 out of 6 of C. bitaeniorhynchus, Giles, and 1 out of 15 of C. tritaeniorhynchus, the total numbers of these mosquitos in the batches being 110, 390 and 1, 520; the virus was preserved in A. japonicus and C. tritaeniorhynchus for 20 days. It was not transmitted to mice by the feeding of artificially infected mosquitos or mosquitos collected in a focus of the disease.It is pointed out that in the Maritime Province, mosquitos capable of transmitting the virus may be present from the end of July, and immunization of the population against the disease should be carried out as quickly as possible, at any rate before the end of June. In view of the readiness with which A. japonicus acquires infection and attacks man, its control is of special importance for preventing the spread of the disease to fresh localities.In subsidiary experiments, no infection could be demonstrated in mosquito larvae of various species when they were fed on the macerated brains of infected mice, in the resulting adults, in larvae or pupae collected in a focus of the disease, or in eggs, larvae or pupae that were the offspring of females fed on infected mouse brain or collected in the rooms of patients [cf.

Previous studies indicated that while IAV commonly causes pancreatitis and pancreatic damage in naturally and experimentally infected animals, the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of IAV infection are less reported. In the present study, we showed for the first time that both avian-like (alpha-2,3-linked) and human-like (alpha-2,6-linked) sialic acid (SA) receptors were expressed by the mouse pancreatic cancer cell line PAN02 and the human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1. Using growth kinetics experiments, we also showed that PAN02 and PANC-1 cells supported the productive replication of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza while exhibited the limited replication of IAV subtypes H1N1 and H7N2 in vitro. The in vivo infection of H5N1 in pancreatic cells was confirmed by the histopathological and immunohistochemical staining of pancreas tissue from mice. Other than H1N1 and H7N2, severe damage and extensive positive signals were observed in pancreas of H5N1 infected mice. All three virus subtypes induced apoptosis but also triggered the infected PAN02 and PANC-1 cells to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including interferon (IFN)-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-6. Notably, the subtypes of H5N1 could significantly upregulate these cytokines and chemokines in both two cells when compared with H1N1 and H7N2. The present data provide further understanding of the pathogenesis of H5N1 IAV in pancreatic cells derived from humans and mammals and may also benefit the development of new treatment against H5N1 influenza virus infection.

The first IFNs to be identified were classified as type I IFNs (IFN-alpha/beta and related molecules), two other types have since been identified: type II IFN (IFN-gamma) and type III IFNs (IFN-lambda). Each IFN binds to one of three type-specific receptors. In the mouse model of experimental infections in vivo, IFN-alpha/beta are essential for immunity to most viruses tested, whereas IFN-gamma is important for immunity to a smaller number of viruses, together with bacteria, fungi, and parasites, consistent with IFN-gamma acting as the 'macrophage activating factor.' The precise role of IFN-lambda remains unclear. In recent years, inborn errors affecting the production of, or the response to, IFNs have been reported in human patients, shedding light onto the function of IFNs in natura. Disorders of IFN-gamma production, caused by IL12B, IL12RB1, and specific NEMO mutations, or of IFN-gamma responses, caused by IFNGR1, IFNGR2, and dominant STAT1 mutations, confer predisposition to mycobacterial disease in patients resistant to most viruses. By contrast, disorders of IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-lambda production, caused by UNC93B1 and TLR3 mutations, confer predisposition to herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in otherwise healthy patients. Consistently, patients with impaired responses to IFN-alpha/beta, IFN-gamma, and presumably IFN-lambda (carrying recessive mutations in STAT1), or with impaired responses to IFN-alpha/beta and impaired IFN-gamma production (carrying mutations in TYK2), or with impaired production of IFN-alpha/beta, IFN-gamma, and IFN-lambda (carrying specific mutations in NEMO), are vulnerable to mycobacterial and viral infections, including HSE. These experiments of nature suggest that the three types of IFNs play at least two different roles in host defense. IFN-gamma is essential for anti-mycobacterial immunity, whereas IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-lambda are essential for anti-viral immunity. Future studies in humans aim to define the specific roles of IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-lambda types and individual molecules in host defense in natura.																					WOS:000260538100004	19161414

Experimental intranasal infection of BALB/c mice with MHV-S caused leukocytosis and increased number of alveolar macrophages. Atypical blastic leukocytes were observed. The number of alveolar macrophages correlated with the amount of MHV-S in lungs. Macrophages have been identified as the major reservoir of latent virus inperitoneal exudate cells (PECs). Using indirect immunofluorescence method we have found the number of CD14 positive cells correlating with the number of MHV-S antigen positive PECs MHV-S infected leukocytes were found to have significantly reduced phagocytic activity. As evaluated by quantification of digested Candida albicans we observed slightly increased phagocytic index of infected leukocytes compared to controls. Taken together, we proved a decrease in ability of these cells to phagocyte due to MHV-S infection.																					WOS:000232717000005

J	Han, Yu-Jung; Kwon, Young-Je; Lee, Kyung-Hyun; Choi, Eun-Jin; Choi, Kyoung-Seong								Experimental infection with non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 in mice induces inflammatory cell infiltration in the spleen								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				161	9			2527	2535		10.1007/s00705-016-2952-2				SEP 2016	2016	Previously, our study showed that oral inoculation of mice with cytopathic (cp) bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) led to lymphocyte depletion and increased numbers of megakaryocytes in the spleen as well as thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. In the present study, to investigate the possible differences in the detection of viral antigen, histopathological lesions, and hematologic changes between non-cytopathic (ncp) BVDV1 and cp BVDV1, mice were orally administered low and high doses of ncp BVDV1 and were necropsied at days 0, 2, 5, and 9 postinfection (pi). None of the ncp BVDV1-infected mice exhibited clinical signs of illness, unlike those infected with cp BVDV1. Statistically significant thrombocytopenia was observed during ncp BVDV1 infection, and lymphopenia was found only in mice infected with a high dose at day 9 pi. Interestingly, ncp BVDV1 infection increased the numbers of basophils, eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes in some infected mice. Viral antigen was detected in the lymphocytes of the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, Peyer's patches, and bone marrow by immunohistochemistry. Lymphoid depletion was evident in the mesenteric lymph nodes of mice infected with a high dose and also found in the Peyer's patches of some infected mice. Infiltration of inflammatory cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, and an increased number of megakaryocytes were seen in the spleen. These results suggest that the distribution of viral antigens is not associated with the presence of histopathological lesions. Inflammatory cell infiltration was observed in the spleens as a result of viral replication and may be attributable to the host reaction to ncp BVDV1 infection. Together, these findings support the possibility that mice can be used as an animal model for BVDV infection.																					WOS:000381973200019	27376375	
J	Lee, Kyung-Hyun; Han, Du-Gyeong; Kim, Suhee; Choi, Eun-Jin; Choi, Kyoung-Seong								Experimental infection of mice with noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus 2 increases the number of megakaryocytes in bone marrow								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				15						115	10.1186/s12985-018-1030-7				JUL 28 2018	2018	Background: Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) causes significant economic losses worldwide in the cattle industry through decrease in productive performance and immunosuppression of animals in herds. Recent studies conducted by our group showed that mice can be infected with BVDV-1 by the oral route. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical signs, hematological changes, histopathological lesions in lymphoid tissues, and the distribution of the vital antigen after oral inoculation with a Korean noncytopathic (ncp) BVDV-2 field isolate in mice.Methods: Mice were orally administered a low or high dose of BVDV-2, blood and tissue samples were collected on days 2, 5, and 9 postinfection (pi). We monitoied clinical signs, hematological changes, histopathological lesions, and tissue distribution of a viral antigen by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PGR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and then compared these parameters with those in ncp BVDV-1 infections.Results: None of the infected mice developed any clinical signs of the illness. Significant thrombocytopenia was found in both low- and high-dose-inoculated mice on day 2 pi. Leukopenia was apparent only in low-dose-inoculated mice on day 2 pi, whereas lymphopenia was not observed in any ncp BVDV-2 infected animal. Viral RNA was found in the spleen in of low- and high-dose-inoculated mice by RT-PCR. According to the results of IHC, the viral antigen was consistently detected in lymphocytes of bone marrow and spleen and less frequently in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), mesenteric lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches. Despite the antigen detection in BALT and mesenteric lymph nodes, histopathological lesions were not observed in these tissues. Lympholysis, infiltration by inflammatory cells, and increased numbers of megakaryocytes were seen in Peyer's patches, spleens, and bone marrow, respectively. In contrast to ncp BVDV-1 infection, lympholysis was found in the spleen of ncp BVDV-2 infected mice. These histopathological lesions were more severe in high-dose-inoculated mice than in low-dose-inoculated mice.Conclusions: Our results provide insight into the pathogenesis of ncp BVDV-2 infection in mice. Collectively, these results highlight significant differences in pathogenesis between ncp BVDV-1 and ncp BVDV-2 infections in a murine model.																					WOS:000440005300001	30055639

We infected > 2,500 mice with the SL3-3 murine leukemia virus; in 22 resulting tumors, we found provirus integrations nearby or within the gene that contains the mir-17-92 microRNA (miRNA) cistron. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we showed that expression of miRNA was increased in these tumors, indicating that retroviral infection can induce expression of oncogenic miRNAs. Our results demonstrate that retroviral mutagenesis can be a potent tool for miRNA discovery.																					WOS:000242689800054	17121985

Repeated infections are common and can be severe in young, elderly, and immunocompromised persons due to short-lived protective humoral immunity. In turn, few protective T cell epitopes have been identified in humans. Thus, we infected transgenic mice expressing the common human HLA MHC-I allele B*07:02 (HLA-B7) with HMPV and screened a robust library of overlapping and computationally predicted HLA-B7 binding peptides. Six HLA-B7-restricted CD8(+) T cell epitopes were identified using ELISPOT screening in the F, M, and N proteins, with M195-203 (M195) eliciting the strongest responses. MHC-tetramer flow cytometric staining confirmed HLA-B7 epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells migrated to lungs and spleen of HMPV-immune mice. Immunization with pooled HLA-B7-restricted peptides reduced viral titer and protected mice from virulent infection. Finally, we confirmed that CD8(+) T cells from HLA-B7 positive humans also recognize the identified epitopes. These results enable identification of HMPV-specific CD8(+) T cells in humans and help to inform future HMPV vaccine design.																					WOS:000709931300051	34675220

That link is supported by a small number of studies using HAdV-36 infection of animals that are not natural hosts for HAdVs. In this study, we infected mice with mouse adenovirus type 1 (MAV-1), a mouse pathogen, to determine whether MAV-1 infected adipose tissue and was associated with adipose tissue inflammation and obesity. We detected MAV-1 in adipose tissue during acute MAV-1 infection, but we did not detect virus-induced increases in adipose tissue cytokine expression or histological evidence of adipose tissue inflammation during acute infection. MAV-1 did not persist in adipose tissue at later times, and we did not detect long-term adipose inflammation, increased adipose tissue mass, or body weight in infected mice. Our data indicate that MAV-1 is not associated with obesity in infected mice.																					WOS:000425575400012	29141203

R			Ciml						Dissecting the molecular programs governing interferon production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells during a viral infection in vivo								European Nucleotide Archive															2020-09-08	2020	Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the major source of type I and type III interferons (IFN-I/III) during viral infections, in response to triggering of endosomal Toll Like Receptors (TLRs) 7 or 9 by viral single-stranded RNA or unmethylated CpG DNA, respectively. Interestingly, this function is restricted to a minor fraction of pDC (Zucchini et al. Int. Immunol. 2008). In this project, we aimed at identifying the molecular pathways involved in inducing IFN-I/III production in this minor faction of pDC during in vivo infection by the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). To achive this goal, we infected with MCMV Ifnb1Eyfp mice, in which IFN-producing pDC can be detected by YFP expression (Scheu et al. PNAS 2008). Thanks to this model, we were able to sort three distinct subsets of pDC: CD86-YFP- (not activated, non IFN-producing), CD86+YFP- (activated, non IFN-producing) and CD86+YFP+ (activated, IFN-producing) and to perform microarray analysis. This allowed us to select genes differentially expressed among these three subsets and to mine these data in order to identify the related signaling pathways. Overall design: Ifnb1Eyfp mice were infected or not with MCMV. Splenic pDC were isolated 36 hours after infection. The following pDC subsets were sorted: CD86-YFP-; CD86+YFP- and CD86+YFP+. The last subset was sorted exclusively from infected mice, while the other two were sorted from both uninfected and infected mice. We performed two independent sortings by pooling splenocytes of 4 (uninfected) or 10-12 (infected) Ifnb1Eyfp mice for each sorting. For each subset we sorted 10,000 cells.

Identification of a Divergent Lineage Porcine Pestivirus in Nursing Piglets with Congenital Tremors and Reproduction of Disease following Experimental Inoculation								PLOS ONE				11	2					e0150104	10.1371/journal.pone.0150104				FEB 24 2016	2016	Congenital tremors is a sporadic disease of neonatal pigs characterized by action-related repetitive myoclonus. A majority of outbreaks of congenital tremors have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were to 1) detect potential pathogen(s) in samples from piglets with congenital tremors and 2) develop an infection model to reproduce disease. Using next-generation sequencing, a divergent lineage pestivirus was detected in piglets with congenital tremors. The virus was originally most closely related to a bat pestivirus but is now more closely related to a recently published novel porcine pestivirus provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus. A quantitative real-time PCR detected the virus in samples from neonatal piglets with congenital tremors from two separate farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To fulfill the second objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with either serum containing the pestivirus or PBS (control) by intravenous and intranasal routes simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic vesicles by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. Inoculations were performed at either 45 or 62 days of gestation. All sows inoculated with the novel pestivirus farrowed piglets affected with congenital tremors while PBS-inoculated control piglets were unaffected. Tremor severity for each piglet was scored from videos taken 0, 1 and 2 days post-farrowing. Tremor severity remained relatively constant from 0 to 2 days post-farrowing for a majority of piglets. The prevalence of congenital tremors in pestivirus-inoculated litters ranged from 57% (4 out of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 out of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors but was not detected in control piglets. Samples positive by PCR in greater than 90% of piglets sampled included brainstem (37 out of 41), mesenteric lymph node (37 out of 41), tracheobronchial lymph node (37 out of 41), and whole blood (19 out of 20). Although the first description of congenital tremors was in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremors following experimental inoculation with a divergent lineage porcine pestivirus. Studies investigating disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors due to this pestivirus.

The rheumatic symptoms in human BFV infection are very similar to those of RRV. Although RRV disease has been studied extensively, little is known about the pathogenesis of BRV infection. We sought to establish a mouse model for BFV to facilitate our understanding of BFV infectivity, tropism and pathogenesis, and to identify key pathological and immunological mechanisms of BFV infection that may distinguish between infections with BRV and RRV. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report the first study assessing the virulence and replication of several BRV isolates in a mouse model. We infected newborn Swiss outbred mice with BFV and established that the BFV2193 prototype was the most virulent strain. BFV2193 infection resulted in the highest mortality among all BRV variant isolates, comparable to that of RRV. In comparison with RRV, C57BL/6 mice infected with BRV showed delayed onset, moderate disease scores and early recovery of the disease. BFV replicated poorly in muscle and did not cause the severe myositis seen in RRV-infected mice. The mRNAs for the inflammatory mediators TNF-alpha, IL-6, CCL2 and arginase-1 were highly upregulated in RRV-but not BRV-infected muscle. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a mouse model of BFV infection, which we have used to demonstrate differences between BR! and RRV infections and to further understand disease pathogenesis. With an increasing number of BFV cases occurring annually, a better understanding of the disease mechanisms is essential for future therapeutic development.

Recent evidence suggests that TNFR-1 and Fas and TRAIL receptors can also trigger an alternative form of cell death that is morphologically distinct from apoptosis. Because distinct molecular components including the serine/threonine protein kinase receptor-interacting protein ( RIP) are required, we have referred to this alternative form of cell death as "programmed necrosis." We show that TNFR-2 signaling can potentiate programmed necrosis via TNFR-1. When cells were pre-stimulated through TNFR-2 prior to subsequent activation of TNFR-1, enhanced cell death and recruitment of RIP to the TNFR-1 complex were observed. However, TNF-induced programmed necrosis was normally inhibited by caspase-8 cleavage of RIP. To ascertain the physiological significance of RIP and programmed necrosis, we infected Jurkat cells with vaccinia virus (VV) and found that VV-infected cells underwent programmed necrosis in response to TNF, but deficiency of RIP rescued the infected cells from TNF-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, TNFR-2(-/-) mice exhibited reduced inflammation in the liver and defective viral clearance during VV infection. Interestingly, death effector domain-containing proteins such as MC159, E8, K13, and cellular FLIP, but not the apoptosis inhibitors Bcl-x(L), p35, and XIAP, potently suppressed programmed necrosis. Thus, TNF-induced programmed necrosis is facilitated by TNFR-2 signaling and caspase inhibition and may play a role in controlling viral infection.																					WOS:000187206300095	14532286

To directly test the effects of RSV LRI, we infected adult and weanling BALB/c mice with RSV (A2) or vehicle. Respiratory system impedance was used to assess baseline airway function and responses to iv methacholine (MCh) at 4, 8, 24 and 34 weeks post infection. In vitro airway responses were measured 24 weeks post infection using electrical field stimulation and MCh. Mice infected as adults showed no alterations in airway function. Mice infected as weanlings had increased MCh responses 24 weeks post infection. However, the increased response was not present 34 weeks post infection nor accompanied by alterations in in vitro responses or airway morphometry. This study did not detect long-lasting changes in airway function following RSV infection in mice. These data do not provide support for alterations in airway structure or function being responsible for the observed relationship between RSV infection in infants and asthma in later life.

Sequence analysis indicated that the PCMV MCP gene is 4,026 nucleotides in length encoding a protein of 1,341 amino acid residues. The predicted molecular weight of the PCMV MCP is 151,456 Da, equivalent to those of other herpesvirus MCP counterparts. Phylogenetic analysis using herpesviral MCP gene sequences confirmed that PCMV is a betaherpesvirus with higher homology with human herpesvirus-6 and -7 than human and mouse cytomegaloviruses. The serum of pig experimentally infected with PCMV did not react with bacterially expressed MCP, suggesting that the PCMV MCP may not be related to the humoral immune response in the course of PCMV infection. Also, we established polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocols using primers corresponding to MCP gene sequences fur detection of PCMV infection. The PCR protocol would be effective for the diagnosis of slow-growing PCMV infection, for which traditional methods involving virus-isolation are not useful.

The majority of recent cases were traced back to contacts with infected domestic cats or pet rats. The aim of the present study was to evaluate a three-dimensional (3D) skin model as a possible replacement for animal experiments. We monitored CPXV lesion formation, viral gene expression and cell cycle patterns after infection of 3D skin cultures with two CPXV strains of different pathogenic potential: a recent pet rat isolate (RatPox09) and the reference Brighton red strain. Infected 3D skin cultures exhibited histological alterations that were similar to those of mammal skin infections, but there were no differences in gene expression patterns and tissue damage between the two CPXV strains in the model system. In conclusion, 3D skin cultures reflect the development of pox lesions in the skin very well, but seem not to allow differentiation between more or less virulent virus strains, a distinction that is made possible by experimental infection in suitable animal models.

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is spread throughout the world and represents one of the biggest problems for the livestock production and food security in Russia. However, recent genome-wide association studies have shown that sensitivity/resistance to BLV is polygenic.The aim of this study was to create a catalog of cattle genes and genes of other mammalian species involved in the pathogenesis of BLV-induced infection and to perform gene prioritization using bioinformatics methods. Based on manually collected information from a range of open sources, a total of 446 genes were included in the catalog of cattle genes and genes of other mammals involved in the pathogenesis of BLV-induced infection. The following criteria were used to prioritize 446 genes from the catalog: (1) the gene is associated with leukemia according to a genome-wide association study; (2) the gene is associated with leukemia according to a case-control study; (3) the role of the gene in leukemia development has been studied using knockout mice; (4) protein-protein interactions exist between the gene-encoded protein and either viral particles or individual viral proteins; (5) the gene is annotated with Gene Ontology terms that are over-represented for a given list of genes; (6) the gene participates in biological pathways from the KEGG or REACTOME databases, which are over-represented for a given list of genes; (7) the protein encoded by the gene has a high number of protein-protein interactions with proteins encoded by other genes from the catalog. Based on each criterion, a rank was assigned to each gene. Then the ranks were summarized and an overall rank was determined. Prioritization of 446 candidate genes allowed us to identify 5 genes of interest which can affect the sensitivity/resistance of cattle to leukemia.																					WOS:000455025900020

Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PTGV) is one of the major adventitious porcine viruses causing contaminated during the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. Therefore, rapid and sensitive detection of PTGV is essential in ensuring the safety of biopharmaceuticals. A TaqMan probe real-time RT-PCR method was developed for the quantitative detection of PTGV contamination in cell substrates, raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products, as well as PTGV clearance validation. Specific primers for the amplification of PTGV RNA were selected, and PTGV RNA was quantified by use of a specific TaqMan probe. Specificity, limit of detection (LOD), and robustness of the method was validated according to international guidelines on the validation of nucleic acid amplification tests. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 1.10 × 100 TCID50/ml. The real-time RT-PCR method was validated to be reproducible, very specific to PTGV, and robust. The established real-time RT-PCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO)-K1 cells artificially infected with PTGV.				세포주를 이용하여 생산하는 생물의약품과 생산용 세포주는 세포 배양 과정 중에 사용되는 돼지 유래 trypsin으로 부터 외래성 돼지 유래 바이러스가 오염될 가능성이 있다.

Kent; Dannen, Devon; Adams, Alice; Parker-Thornburg, Jan; Kolattukudy, Pappachan								Murine cytomegalovirus infection markedly reduces serum MCP-1 levels in MCP-1 transgenic mice								ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY SCIENCE				36	2			179	184						SPR 2006	2006	Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a pro-inflammatory chemokine believed to play a major role in atherogenesis. Injured endothelial cells express MCP-1, which attracts monocytes to the blood vessel wall and leads to the formation of atheromas. Cytomegalovirus infection may also play a role in atherogenesis and accelerates inflammation in tissues that overexpress MCP-1. To examine the relationship of cytomegalovirus infection and MCP-1, we infected MCP-1 transgenic mice with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and collected serum 6 days post-infection to evaluate TH1-related cytokine levels by ELISA. Serum levels of IL-10, IL-12 and IFN-alpha were increased in MCP-1 transgenic mice on day 6 following MCMV infection, while levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha were undetectable. However, MCP-1 serum levels were reduced > 50% in MCP-1 transgenic mice following MCMV infection compared to uninfected transgenic mice. This effect was not as dramatic when an M33 null MCMV was administered to MCP-1 transgenic mice. The mechanism by which MCMV lowers serum MCP-1 levels is unknown, but this effect may enhance the survival of the virus and thus allow CMV to contribute to the chronic inflammation of atherogenesis.

The asymptomatic infection induced in white mice by intranasal inoculation of Pixuna virus is characterized by intensive virus multiplication in the brain and spleen of the animals. In these organs virus reproduction is observed early after infection and amplification of the agent reaches maximum titres within 72 h postinfection. With this model, the main criterion of the effectiveness of antiviral drugs would be their effect on virus reproduction in the spleen and brain.																					BCI:BCI198681011503

Comprehensive data on the pathogenesis of EBOV infection are lacking; however, recent studies suggested that fatal EBOV infections are characterized by dysregulation of the innate immune response and a subsequent cytokine storm. Specifically, several studies suggested that hypersecretion of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) correlates with lethal EBOV infections. To examine the significance of IL-1Ra in EBOV infections, we infected mice that lack the gene encoding IL-1Ra, Il1rn (IL-1RNKO), and mice with wild-type Il1rn (IL-1RN-WT) with a mouse-adapted EBOV (MA-EBOV). Infected IL-1RN-KO mice lost more weight and had a lower survival rate than IL-1RN-WT mice infected with MA-EBOV. In addition, IL-1RN-KO mice infected with wild-type EBOV, which does not cause lethal infection in adult immunocompetent mice, such as C57BL/6 mice, experienced greater weight loss than IL-1RN-WT mice infected with wild-type EBOV. Further studies revealed that the levels of 6 cytokines in spleens-IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, interleukin 12p40, interleukin 17, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted-were significantly different between IL-1RN-KO mice and IL-1RN-WT mice infected with MA-EBOV. Collectively, our data suggest that IL-1Ra may have a protective effect upon EBOV infection, likely by damping an overactive proinflammatory immune response.

J	Duque, PM; Parada, C; Guinea, J; Sanchez-Prieto, R; Cajal, SRY								Selective effects of E1B-defective adenoviruses and adenovirus E1A mutants in deficient mouse primary embryonic fibroblasts								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY				18	6			1163	1167						JUN 2001	2001	E1B-defective adenoviruses have been described as exerting selective cytopathic effects on transformed cells. Previously, we showed that adenovirus dl118, lacking both E1B proteins, very efficiently kills most human malignant cell lines. In order to study whether these selective effects were due to selective replication of dl118 in cells harboring specific genetic alterations, we compared the viability of various deficient mouse primary fibroblasts. We studied mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from p16, p21, p27 and p53 knockout mice, as well as wild-type MEFs. We infected them with 100 p.f.u. of adenoviruses adl118, adwt300, and adenoviruses carrying the E1A mutant 922 (the Ela product only binds to the p300 and related proteins) and Ad646 (the E1A product binds to the pRb and related proteins). The percentage of infectivity was evaluated with an adenovirus carrying the green fluorescent protein (AdGFP). With AdGFP, clear green fluorescent signals were detected in more than 70% of the cells after 3 days of infection. After infection with several adenoviruses, we observed that E1A mutant 922 killed all the MFFs. Conversely, the E1a mutant Ad646 exerted its major effects on control wild-type MEFs. Moreover, Adl118 killed the wtMEFs and other MEFs slightly more efficiently than did wtAd, but less than Ad922. No viral replication was detected by adding the obtained supernatants to HEK293 cells. Due to the absence of significant viral replication on these cells, the results could be interpreted as direct effects of E1A and E1A mutant proteins on the different mouse cells carrying diverse genetic alterations.

Analysis of tentative progression in quantum and direction of rabies virus indicated that hippocampus. cerebellum, pons and medulla oblongata are much more dependable sites to attempt isolation of rabies virus in buffalo species especially when a rabid buffalo has been killed during early phase of the disease. On histopathological examination, typical non-suppurative encephalo-myelitis was observed. The central neural transport mechanism of rabies virus has been monitored by specific immunofluorescence, histopathological findings.

Swiss OF-1 mice were inoculated peripherally with strain RV61 (classical rabies Virus), RV 1423 (EBLV-1) or RV 1332 (EBLV-2) to compare the nature and extent of histopathological changes produced. Inoculated animals developed varying degrees of non-suppurative encephalitis, and lyssavirus infection was confirmed by the detection of viral antigen. The lesions produced, which included perivascular cuffs and gliosis, were more severe after RV1423 or RV1332 infection than after RV61 infection. Perivascular cuffs were mainly localized to caudal brain regions, irrespective of the infecting strain; after RV1332 infection, however, they were particularly abundant, being composed of large numbers of inflammatory cells. T cells were the predominant lymphocytic component of the inflammatory infiltrate in both the Virchow-Robin space and the brain parenchyma. Viral antigen, which was widespread throughout the brain, was apparently unrelated to the degree of cuffing. The study suggested that there was increased immune activation after inoculation with strain RV1423 or RV 1332, particularly the latter, but that this did not affect the final outcome.

Recent studies have detected viruses in renal tissues of patients with IgAN. Enteroviruses have been reported as pathogenic agents in some renal diseases. We previously reported that group B coxsackieviruses cause pathological changes in experimentally infected mouse kidney. The aim of the present study was to examine the participation of enteroviruses in the pathogenesis of renal diseases including IgAN. Renal biopsies of ten patients with IgAN (group 1) and of 19 patients with non-IgAN renal disease(group 2) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of enteroviral RNA. Positive PCR results were obtained for three patients (30%) of group 1. We confirmed by sequencing that the positive PCR products were derived from strains of enteroviruses. One of these three patients also had a positive result for lymphocytes from peripheral blood. In contrast, enteroviral RNA was detected in none of the 19 patients of group 2. The incidence of enteroviral RNA detection in patients of group 1 was higher than that in group 2 (P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that enteroviral infection may have the possibility of becoming one of the factors involved in the mechanism of onset or evolution of IgAN.

J	Mysorekar, Indira U								Zika Virus Takes a Transplacental Route to Infect Fetuses: Insights from an Animal Model.								Missouri medicine				114	3			168	170						2017 May-Jun	2017	Zika virus (ZIKV) has been linked to intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), spontaneous miscarriage, and microcephaly in infants of women infected during pregnancy. To determine how ZIKV affects the fetus, we infected pregnant mice subcutaneously (mimicking a mosquito bite) with ZIKV. Multiple techniques revealed that ZIKV replicated within placental trophoblasts, fetal endothelial cells, and the fetal neocortex. We also noted severe placental defects, IUGR, and fetal death. Thus, our mouse model recapitulated ZIKV infection in human pregnancy and demonstrated that ZIKV can be transmitted from mother to fetus via the placenta.

Zentralblatt fur Veterinarmedizin				15B				40	648						1968	1968	Experimental infection in various experimental animals was carried out with some strains of Staph. aureus of avian and mammalian origin. Dermatitis, as observed in spontaneous cases on poultry farms, was induced in many cases in mice, rabbits and chickens inoculated with organisms derived from infected chickens, whereas in g.pigs, a similar dermatitis was seldom observed. The ability to cause dermatitis and death of these animals was different for each strain. On the other hand, strains of mammalian origin failed to produce dermatitis in any animals used in this experiment. With experimental infection in chick embryos, organisms of avian origin showed a somewhat higher virulence than those of mammalian origin. It was observed that younger mice and chicks were more sensitive to infection. It could not be confirmed that the association of fowl pox virus enhances the severity of staphylococcal infection. The infection seemed to be enhanced when the skin was treated with xylol before inoculation.																					CABI:19692200489

The aim of the present study was to identify specific genes and pathways in the deep cervical lymph node (cLN) and spleen of experimentally infected SJL-mice, using DNA microarrays. Analyses identified 387 genes in the deep cLN and only 6 genes in the spleen of infected animals. The lymph node presented 27.4% of genes with fold changes +/- 1.5 at 14 days post infection (dpi) and a reduced transcription at later time points. K-means clustering analyses resulted in five clusters. Accordingly, functional annotation revealed that the B-cell immune response pathway was the most up-regulated cluster at the early phase. Additionally, an increase of CD68- and lysozyme-positive cells in the deep cLN was observed by immunohistochemistry. Polioencephalitis was most intense at 14 dpi, and the spinal cord demyelinating leukomyelitis started at 42 dpi.In summary, early gene expression is indicative of virus-trigged immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS)-draining lymph node. The decreased gene transcription in the deep cLN during the chronic phase and the low number of spleen genes supports the hypothesis of a compartmentalized inflammation within the CNS, as described in progressive MS.

Malaria-Induced NLRP12/NLRP3-Dependent Caspase-1 Activation Mediates Inflammation and Hypersensitivity to Bacterial Superinfection								PLOS PATHOGENS				10	1					e1003885	10.1371/journal.ppat.1003885				JAN 2014	2014	Cyclic paroxysm and high fever are hallmarks of malaria and are associated with high levels of pyrogenic cytokines, including IL-1. In this report, we describe a signature for the expression of inflammasome-related genes and caspase-1 activation in malaria. Indeed, when we infected mice, Plasmodium infection was sufficient to promote MyD88-mediated caspase-1 activation, dependent on IFN--priming and the expression of inflammasome components ASC, P2X7R, NLRP3 and/or NLRP12. Pro-IL-1 expression required a second stimulation with LPS and was also dependent on IFN--priming and functional TNFR1. As a consequence of Plasmodium-induced caspase-1 activation, mice produced extremely high levels of IL-1 upon a second microbial stimulus, and became hypersensitive to septic shock. Therapeutic intervention with IL-1 receptor antagonist prevented bacterial-induced lethality in rodents. Similar to mice, we observed a significantly increased frequency of circulating CD14(+)CD16(-)Caspase-1(+) and CD14(dim)CD16(+)Caspase-1(+) monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from febrile malaria patients. These cells readily produced large amounts of IL-1 after stimulation with LPS. Furthermore, we observed the presence of inflammasome complexes in monocytes from malaria patients containing either NLRP3 or NLRP12 pyroptosomes. We conclude that NLRP12/NLRP3-dependent activation of caspase-1 is likely to be a key event in mediating systemic production of IL-1 and hypersensitivity to secondary bacterial infection during malaria.Author Summary Together Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax infect approximately 250 million individuals, reaping life of near one million children every year. Extensive research on malaria pathogenesis has funneled into the consensus that the clinical manifestations are often a consequence of the systemic inflammation. Importantly, secondary bacterial and viral infections potentiate this inflammatory reaction being important co-factors for the development of severe disease. One of the hallmarks of malaria syndrome is the paroxysm, which is characterized by high fever associated with peak of parasitemia. In this study we dissected the mechanisms of induction and the importance of the pyrogenic cytokine, IL-1 in the pathogenesis of malaria. Our results demonstrate the critical role of the innate immune receptors named Toll-Like Receptors and inflammasome on induction, processing and release of active form of IL-1 during malaria. Importantly, we provide evidences that bacterial superinfection further potentiates the Plasmodium-induced systemic inflammation, leading to the release of bulk amounts of IL-1 and severe disease. Hence, this study uncovers new checkpoints that could be targeted for preventing systemic inflammation and severe malaria.																					WOS:000332640900054	24453977	
J	Yarilin, DA; Valiando, J; Posnett, DN								A mouse herpesvirus induces relapse of experimental autoimmune arthritis by infection of the inflammatory target tissue								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				173	8			5238	5246		10.4049/jimmunol.173.8.5238				OCT 15 2004	2004	It is not known what is required for successive relapses in autoimmune diseases or evolution to a progressive chronic disease. Autoimmune arthritis caused by passive transfer of autoantibodies against glucose 6-phosphate isomerase is transient and therefore lends itself well to test for what might extend the disease. Herpesviruses have long been suspected of contributing to human autoimmune disease. We infected mice with a murine gamma-herpesvirus (MHV-68). In immunodeficient mice, transient arthritis was followed by a relapse. This was due to lytic viral infection of synovial tissues demonstrated by PCR, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy. Latent infection could be reactivated in the synovium of normal mice when treated with Cytoxan and this was associated with increased clinical arthritis. We conclude that herpesviruses may play an ancillary pathogenic role in autoimmune arthritis by infection of the inflammatory target tissue.																					WOS:000224392200055	15470069

Autopsies were performed to study the brains and spinal cords of 94 arctic foxes (cadavers from commercial hunting, sick animals which had been killed, and those which had died), 2 specimens of Vulpes, 2 dogs, and 39 lemmings. Aseptically prepared suspensions in physiological salt solution of the brains of sick animals were used to infect rabbits by intracerebral or intramuscular injection. In 10 to 15 days the rabbits developed the same kind of illness with symptoms of severe infection of the central nervous system; this usually lasted 2 or 3 days and ended fatally. In a 2d passage the clinical picture was the same, but on the 3d, if the brain was taken from an animal which had died and not from one which had been killed, the activity of the virus was attenuated. Similar results were obtained in the experimental infection of 6 arctic foxes. The viral activity could be preserved in frozen brain tissue for 202 days. In the brain cells of animals suffering from "madness" no Negri bodies were observed; no symptoms of hydrophobia were noted; the spread of the disease was limited to the polar region; and it did not spread to man. Judging by the remaining symptoms this "madness" is very similar to rabies: for this reason the author recommends that measures be taken to control the disease.

In South America, Andes orthohantavirus (Hantaviridae, Orthohantavirus; ANDV) is a major cause of HCPS, particularly in Chile and Argentina, where thousands of cases have been reported since the virus was discovered. Two strains of ANDV that are classically used for experimental studies of the virus are Chile-9717869, isolated from the natural reservoir, the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, and CHI-7913, an isolate from a lethal human case of HCPS. An important animal model for studying pathogenesis of HCPS is the lethal Syrian golden hamster model of ANDV infection. In this model, ANDV strain Chile-9717869 is uniformly lethal and has been used extensively for pathogenesis, vaccination, and therapeutic studies. Here, we show that the CHI 7913 strain, despite having high sequence similarity with Chile-9717869, does not cause lethal disease in Syrian hamsters. CHI-7913, while being able to infect hamsters and replicate to moderate levels, showed a reduced ability to replicate within the tissues compared with Chile-9717869. Hamsters infected with CHI-7913 had reduced expression of cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-6, and gamma interferon compared with Chile-9717869-infected animals, suggesting potentially limited immune mediated pathology. These results demonstrate that certain ANDV strains may not be lethal in the classical Syrian hamster model of infection, and further exploration into the differences between lethal and nonlethal strains should provide important insights into molecular determinants of pathogenic hantavirus infection.IMPORTANCE Andes orthohantavirus (ANDV) is a New World hantavirus that is a major cause of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS; also referred to as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in South America, particularly in Chile and Argentina. ANDV is one of the few hantaviruses for which there is a reliable animal model, the Syrian hamster model, which recapitulates important aspects of human disease. Here, we infected hamsters with a human isolate of ANDV, CHI 7913, to assess its pathogenicity compared with the classical lethal Chile-9717869 strain. CHI-791 3 had 22 amino acid differences from Chile-9717869, did not cause lethal disease in hamsters, and showed reduced ability to replicate in vivo. Our data indicate potentially important molecular signatures for the pathogenesis of ANDV infection in hamsters and may lead to insights into what drives the pathogenesis of certain hantaviruses in humans.

Reversion to ancestral Zika virus NS1 residues increases competence ofAedes albopictus								PLOS PATHOGENS				16	10					e1008951	10.1371/journal.ppat.1008951				OCT 2020	2020	Both mosquito species-specific differences and virus strain -specific differences impact vector competence. Previous results in our laboratory with individual populations of N. American mosquitoes support studies suggestingAedes aegyptiare more competent thanAe.albopictusfor American Zika virus (ZIKV) strains and demonstrate that U.S.Ae.albopictushave higher competence for an ancestral Asian ZIKV strain. A982V, an amino acid substitution in the NS1 gene acquired prior to the American outbreak, has been shown to increase competence inAe.aegypti. We hypothesized that variability in the NS1 could therefore contribute to species-specific differences and developed a reverse genetics system based on a 2016 ZIKV isolate from Honduras (ZIKV-WTic) to evaluate the phenotypic correlates of individual amino acid substitutions. In addition to A982V, we evaluated G894A, which was acquired during circulation in the Americas. Reversion of 982 and 894 to ancestral residues increased infectivity, transmissibility and viral loads inAe.albopictusbut had no effect on competence or replication inAe.aegypti. In addition, while host cell-specific differences in NS1 secretion were measured, with significantly higher secretion in mammalian cells relative to mosquito cells, strain-specific differences in secretion were not detected, despite previous reports. These results demonstrate that individual mutations in NS1 can influence competence in a species-specific manner independent of differences in NS1 secretion and further indicate that ancestral NS1 residues confer increased competence inAe.albopictus. Lastly, experimental infections ofIfnar1(-/-)mice demonstrated that these NS1 substitutions can influence viral replication in the host and, specifically, that G894A could represent a compensatory change following a fitness loss from A982V with some viral genetic backgrounds. Together these data suggest a possible role for epistatic interactions in ZIKV fitness in invertebrate and vertebrate hosts and demonstrate that strains with increased transmission potential in U.S.Ae.albopictuscould emerge.Author summary The factors that facilitated the emergence and rapid dissemination of ZIKV in the Americas, and the specific role of strain variation and adaptive evolution in ZIKV transmission, are not fully understood. It has been shown that an amino acid substitution in the NS1 gene acquired prior to the American outbreak confers increased infectivity inAe.aegypti. Therefore, we hypothesized that variability in the NS1 could contribute to species-specific differences. To investigate the role of the ZIKV NS1 in competence of bothAe.aegyptiandAe.albopictuswe utilized reverse genetics to revert to the ancestral NS1 residues and characterized the resultant mutant strains. Reversions increased infectivity, transmissibility and viral loads inAe.albopictusbut had no effect on competence or replication inAe.aegypti. Additionally, we assessed the effect of these mutations on NS1 secretion and both virulence and viremia kinetics using a ZIKV mouse model. NS1 secretion, as well as vertebrate morbidity or mortality, were similar among strains, yet strain-specific differences in viremia levels were identified. These results demonstrate that individual mutations in NS1 can influence competence in a species-specific manner independent of differences in NS1 secretion and further indicate that ancestral NS1 residues confer increased competence inAe.albopictus. Moreover, contrasting these data with previous studies suggests a role for epistatic interactions in ZIKV fitness in invertebrate and vertebrate hosts.

J	Tokunaga, H.								Increases in hemagglutinin (HA) sugar chains may contribute to the survival of influenza viruses among humans?								Kawasaki Medical Journal				35	4			319	328						2009	2009	Since it emerged in 1968, the human influenza A virus H3N2 subtype (so-called Hong Kong type) has undergone repeated antigenic mutations with resulting epidemics. As well, the number of sugar chains (oligosaccharides) in the globular region of hemagglutinin (HA) has gradually increased. It has been speculated that this increase in oligosaccharides may have contributed to the survival of this virus among humans. This could be because the sugar chains cover the major antigenic site of HA and so the virus escapes any attack form the host's immune system. However this concept has not been examined experimentally. The present study investigated this concept by reverse genetics and experimental infections in mice. The glycosylation sites of HA of A/Okayama/06/01 were removed by mutagenesis retrospective deconstruction, one after another. Through reverse genetics, mutant viruses were generated. Mice were intranasally infected with the original (H3-0) and mutant viruses in which the 1 to 3 glycosylation sites were removed (named H3-1, H3-2 and H3-3, respectively). One month after infection, sera were collected from infected mice and the cross reactivity of the neutralizing antibodies in the sera were assayed using various combinations of sera and viruses. H3-1 and H3-2 were highly cross-reactive, whereas H3-0 and H3-3 were clearly distinguished from H3-1 and H3-2, respectively. Both the addition and the deletion of a glycosylation site reduced cross reactivity. The present study indicated that oligosaccharides may be convenient tools for modifying immunogenicity, thereby helping an escape from immune recognition. This report also discussed an influenza epidemic pattern in New York City from this point of view.																					CABI:20103094242		
J	Hundekar, SL; Thakare, JP; Gokhale, MD; Barde, PV; Argade, SV; Mourya, DT								Development of monoclonal antibody based antigen capture ELISA to detect chikungunya virus antigen in mosquitoes								INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH				115				144	148						APR 2002	2002	Background & objectives: Chikungunya (CHIK) virus has caused numerous large outbreaks in India. No active or passive surveillance has been carried out since the last epidemic which occurred in 1971. For active surveillance, it is necessary to have a test, which can detect the virus from a large number of field-collected mosquitoes.Methods: The present study describes the standardization of monoclonal antibody (MAb) based antigen capture ELISA to detect chikungunya virus antigen from the mosquitoes. CHIK virus antigen front suspension of experimentally infected mosquitoes and their progeny was captured on mouse polyclonal antibody, while biotinylated CHIK Mab was used as a probing antibody. CHIK virus antigen in the head squashes of virus inoculated mosquitoes was detected using indirect immunofluorescence antibody (IFA) test for confirmation of ELISA results.Results: The ELISA test was sensitive enough to detect antigen even if a small fraction of a single infected mosquito homogenate was incorporated in the test. The IFA test failed to detect CHIK antigen in 10 and 25 mul of suspension whereas with ELISA it was detected in all the samples. Progeny of Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes infected with chikungunya virus did not show the possibility of existence of transovarial transmission.Interpretation & conclusion: This test is rapid and simple since it can be completed in two days as compared to the conventional mosquito inoculation and IFA techniques, which require at least 10 days. There is an additional advantage with this test that a large number of samples can be processed, and the remaining homogenate of the mosquitoes can be used for screening other viruses. Experimental data raised using this test showed that transovarial transmission of this virus does not occur in these vector species.																					WOS:000177941000002	12239836

This neuropathology is believed to result from significant death of neuronal progenitor cells (NPC). Here, we examined the fate of neurons in the developing hippocampus, a brain structure which houses neuronal populations of different maturation states. For this purpose, we infected hippocampal slice cultures from immunocompetent newborn mice with ZIKV and monitored changes in hippocampal architecture. In neurons of all hippocampal subfields ZIKV was detected by immunofluorescence labeling and electron microscopy. This includes pyramidal neurons that maturate during the embryonic phase. In the dentate gyrus, ZIKV could be found in the Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells which belong to the earliest born cortical neurons, but also in granule cells that are predominantly generated postnatally. Intriguingly, virus particles were also present in the correctly outgrowing mossy fiber axons of juvenile granule cells, suggesting that viral infection does not impair region- and layer-specific formation of this projection. ZIKV infection of hippocampal tissue was accompanied by both a profound astrocyte reaction indicating tissue injury and a microglia response suggesting phagocytotic activity. Furthermore, depending on the viral load and incubation time, we observed extensive overall neuronal loss in the cultured hippocampal slice cultures. Thus, we conclude ZIKV can replicate in various neuronal populations and trigger neuronal death independent of the maturation state of infected cells.

B	Tennant, Bud C.; Hornbuckle, William E.; Gerin, John L.						Weber, O; Protzer, U		The woodchuck model of hepadnavirus infection								Comparative Hepatitis		Birkhauser Advances in Infectious Diseases						271	301		10.1007/978-3-7643-8558-3_13				2008	2008	Since discovery of the hepatitis B virus (HBV), closely related viruses have been described in several animal species. ne first of these was the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), identified in woodchucks (Marmota monax) that were maintained at the Philadelphia Zoological Garden and which had experienced a high prevalence of chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). On the basis of morphological and molecular analyses, it was concluded that WHV was closely related to HBV. Since description of WHV, infection with viruses that belong to the family Hepadnaviridae have been described in the California ground squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyi) and the Arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryi), two species closely related phylogenetically to woodchucks, and in six avian species. A total of four well characterized, mammalian hepadnaviruses now have been associated with development of HCC. These observations on naturally acquired hepadnavirus infections combined with the development of HCC in woodchucks following experimental infection with WHV or with the California ground squirrel virus (GSHV) provides, by analogy, convincing comparative medical evidence for the hepatocarcinogenicity of HBV. The woodchuck has become useful as an experimental animal model for research on the pathogenesis of HBV infection and for investigation of the molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis. The woodchuck also has been useful in the discovery and preclinical development of antiviral drugs for treatment of HBV infection and for testing new forms of immunotherapy using cytokines and therapeutic vaccination. In particular, the woodchuck has been valuable for determining the impact of long-term antiviral treatment on the outcome of chronic hepadnavirus infection in placebo controlled, lifetime survival studies which have been predictive of the results of subsequent clinical trials.

B	Balsitis, Scott J.; Harris, Eva						Hanley, KA; Weaver, SC		Animal Models of Dengue Virus Infection and Disease: Applications, Insights and Frontiers								FRONTIERS IN DENGUE VIRUS RESEARCH								103	120						2010	2010	Many important questions in dengue pathogenesis are difficult to address without appropriate animal models of infection and disease. However, animal models of dengue virus (DENV) infection have been hampered by the fact that no non-human species naturally exhibits disease similar to human dengue fever or dengue shock syndrome following natural or experimental infection. Recently, though, many aspects of human DENV infection and disease have been reproduced in mice by manipulating the host and/or the virus to facilitate susceptibility to infection, and judicious use of these mouse models in combination with non-human primate models of DENV infection has resulted in substantial progress. This chapter briefly reviews the animal models for DENV infection currently available, and surveys the contributions each has made to four key areas in dengue research: pathogenesis, immunity and immunopathogenesis, therapeutic drug development, and vaccine development.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				35	1			1	4						2013	2013	An epidemic disease characterized by neurologic symptoms and death in neonatal piglets occurred in many large scale pig farms of mainland China since 2011. To investigate the causative agent of the disease, the gE of pseudorabies virus (PRV) was amplified by PCR from the brain tissues of dead piglets and the results showed that PRVs were found in all detected farms. Sequence alignments of gE indicated that gE genes from 14 farms of 5 provinces in 2012 were highly homologous and they were all belong to a relatively independent sub-branch in phylogenetic analysis. In addition, the isolated PRV named HeN1 was able to cause itch and death in experimentally infected mice and the LD50 of PRV HeN1 isolate was 10237 TCID50 which was significantly lower than that of virulent PRV Shuangcheng strain (103.83 TCID50). Furthermore, the cross-neutralization tests indicated that the serum from Bartha k61 vaccine strain inoculated pigs had low neutralizing effect to the PRV HeN1 isolate, but serum from HeN1 inoculated pigs had higher neutralizing effect to both of the viruses. In conclusion, we speculated that the prevalence of PRVs might have antigenic variation to some extent since 2011.																					CABI:20133066311

Indian Journal of Animal Health				31	1			15	20						1992	1992	A total of 20 albino mice were divided into two groups, each of 10 mice and each mouse was inoculated with challenge virus strain (CVS) of rabies fixed virus using intracerebral (i.c.) route in Group-I and subcutaneous (s.c.) route in Group-II. The brain, salivary glands, skin, corneas, livers, spleen and kidneys were collected for the fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and counter-immunoelectrophoresis (CIE) test for the detection of rabies viral antigen. The first clinical signs were observed 3 days after infection in Group-I mice and on the 4th day in Group-II mice. Average incubation periods in Group-I and Group-II mice were 3 and 5 days, respectively. One mouse survived with i.c. route of inoculation and 2 mice survived with s.c. route of inoculation. Amongst the mice killed pre-clinically the brain, salivary glands and cornea of Group-I mice only were positive by FAT but negative by CIE. All organs of the mice killed post-clinically were positive by FAT. The intensity of fluorescence with FAT and the rate of positivity with CIE also increased with time after infection. FAT was more sensitive then CIE.																					CABI:19922271939

A phylogenetic analysis showed that the H6N1 viruses of wild birds and domestic ducks were of the same genotype (K-1) and were similar to the H6N1 virus isolated from a live poultry market in 2003, as six of the eight gene segments of those viruses had a common source. However, the H6N2 viruses of domestic poultry were separated into four genotypes (K-2a, K-2b, K-2c and K-2d) by at least a triple reassortment between influenza viruses of low pathogenicity from Korean poultry (H9N2 and H3N2) and viruses from aquatic birds. In an experimental infection of animals, certain H6 Al viruses replicated well in chickens and mice without pre-adaptation, indicating that H6 virus pathogenicity has the potential to be altered due to multiple reassortments, and that these reassortments could result in interspecies transmission to mammals.

Siglec-H inhibits TLR9-induced IFN-alpha production by pDCs. Previously, it was found that Siglec-H-deficient mice develop a lupus-like severe autoimmune disease after persistent murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection. This was due to enhanced type I interferon responses, including IFN-alpha. Here we examined, whether other virus infections can also induce autoimmunity in Siglec-H-deficient mice. To this end we infected Siglec-H-deficient mice with influenza virus or with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13. With both types of viruses we did not observe induction of autoimmune disease in Siglec-H-deficient mice. This can be explained by the fact that both types of viruses are ssRNA viruses that engage TLR7, rather than TLR9. Also, Influenza causes an acute infection that is rapidly cleared and the chronicity of LCMV clone 13 may not be sufficient and may rather suppress pDC functions. Siglec-H inhibited exclusively TLR-9 driven type I interferon responses, but did not affect type II or type III interferon production by pDCs. Siglec-H-deficient pDCs showed impaired Hck expression, which is a Src-family kinase expressed in myeloid cells, and downmodulation of the chemokine receptor CCR9, that has important functions for pDCs. Accordingly, Siglec-H-deficient pDCs showed impaired migration towards the CCR9 ligand CCL25. Furthermore, autoimmune-related genes such as Klk1 and DNase1l3 are downregulated in Siglec-H-deficient pDCs as well. From these findings we conclude that Siglec-H controls TLR-9-dependent, but not TLR-7 dependent inflammatory responses after virus infections and regulates chemokine responsiveness of pDCs.

Results showed that such prepared antigens are highly specific to the serum samples derived from DTMUV-infected animals. No spurious hemagglutination reactions against serum samples specific to avian influenza virus H5, H7, H9 subtypes, Newcastle disease virus, egg drop syndrome virus, duck plague virus, and duck hepatitis A virus were observed. The HI test can detect specific antibodies in the serum samples as early as day 4 after experimental infection of ducks with DTMUV. When compared to a virus neutralization test, the sensitivity is 100%. Overall, the HI test developed is highly specific to DTMUV and can be used in clinical diagnosis of diseases and in vaccine studies to monitor the kinetics of antibody response.

J	Tao, Pan; Mahalingam, Marthandan; Zhu, Jingen; Moayeri, Mahtab; Sha, Jian; Lawrence, William S.; Leppla, Stephen H.; Chopra, Ashok K.; Rao, Venigalla B.								A Bacteriophage T4 Nanoparticle-Based Dual Vaccine against Anthrax and Plague								MBIO				9	5					e01926-18	10.1128/mBio.01926-18				SEP-OCT 2018	2018	Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis, the causative agents of anthrax and plague, respectively, are two of the deadliest pathogenic bacteria that have been used as biological warfare agents. Although Biothrax is a licensed vaccine against anthrax, no Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccine exists for plague. Here, we report the development of a dual anthrax-plague nanoparticle vaccine employing bacteriophage (phage) T4 as a platform. Using an in vitro assembly system, the 120-by 86-nm heads (capsids) of phage T4 were arrayed with anthrax and plague antigens fused to the small outer capsid protein Soc (9 kDa). The antigens included the anthrax protective antigen (PA) (83 kDa) and the mutated (mut) capsular antigen F1 and the low-calcium-response V antigen of the type 3 secretion system from Y. pestis (F1mutV) (56 kDa). These viral nanoparticles elicited robust anthrax-and plague-specific immune responses and provided complete protection against inhalational anthrax and/or pneumonic plague in three animal challenge models, namely, mice, rats, and rabbits. Protection was demonstrated even when the animals were simultaneously challenged with lethal doses of both anthrax lethal toxin and Y. pestis CO92 bacteria. Unlike the traditional subunit vaccines, the phage T4 vaccine uses a highly stable nanoparticle scaffold, provides multivalency, requires no adjuvant, and elicits broad T-helper 1 and 2 immune responses that are essential for complete clearance of bacteria during infection. Therefore, phage T4 is a unique nanoparticle platform to formulate multivalent vaccines against high-risk pathogens for national preparedness against potential bioterror attacks and emerging infections.IMPORTANCE Following the deadly anthrax attacks of 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis that cause anthrax and plague, respectively, are two Tier 1 select agents that pose the greatest threat to the national security of the United States. Both cause rapid death, in 3 to 6 days, of exposed individuals. We engineered a virus nanoparticle vaccine using bacteriophage T4 by incorporating key antigens of both B. anthracis and Y. pestis into one formulation. Two doses of this vaccine provided complete protection against both inhalational anthrax and pneumonic plague in animal models. This dual anthrax-plague vaccine is a strong candidate for stockpiling against a potential bioterror attack involving either one or both of these biothreat agents. Further, our results establish the T4 nanoparticle as a novel platform to develop multivalent vaccines against pathogens of high public health significance.

Challenge Pools of Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes 1-6 Prototype Strains: Replication Fitness and Pathogenicity in Chimpanzees and Human Liver-Chimeric Mouse Models								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				201	9			1381	1389		10.1086/651579				MAY 1 2010	2010	Chimpanzees represent the only animal model for studies of the natural history of hepatitis C virus (HCV). To generate virus stocks of important HCV variants, we infected chimpanzees with HCV strains of genotypes 1-6 and determined the infectivity titer of acute-phase plasma pools in additional animals. The courses of first- and second-passage infections were similar, with early appearance of viremia, HCV RNA titers of >10(4.7) IU/mL, and development of acute hepatitis; the chronicity rate was 56%. The challenge pools had titers of 10(3)-10(5) chimpanzee infectious doses/mL. Human liver-chimeric mice developed high-titer infections after inoculation with the challenge viruses of genotypes 1-6. Inoculation studies with different doses of the genotype 1b pool suggested that a relatively high virus dose is required to consistently infect chimeric mice. The challenge pools represent a unique resource for studies of HCV molecular virology and for studies of pathogenesis, protective immunity, and vaccine efficacy in vivo.

Typical efficacy studies utilize a large number of animals and severe morbidity or mortality as an endpoint. New technologies provide a means to reduce and refine the animal use as proposed in Hume's 3Rs (replacement, reduction, refinement) described by Russel and Burch. In vivo imaging systems (IVIS) and bioluminescent enzyme technologies accomplish the reduction of animal requirements while shortening the experimental time and improving the accuracy in localizing active virus replication. In the case of murine models of viral encephalitis in which central nervous system (CNS) viral invasion occurs rapidly but the disease development is relatively slow, we visualized the initial brain infection and enhance the data collection process required for efficacy studies on antivirals or vaccines that are aimed at preventing brain infection. Accordingly, we infected mice through intranasal inoculation with the genetically modified pathogen, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, which expresses a luciferase gene. In this study, we were able to identify the invasion of the CNS at least 3 days before any clinical signs of disease, allowing for reduction of animal morbidity providing a humane means of disease and vaccine research while obtaining scientific data accurately and more rapidly. Based on our data from the imaging model, we confirmed the usefulness of this technology in preclinical research by demonstrating the efficacy of Ampligen, a TLR-3 agonist, in preventing CNS invasion.

J	Lee, SH; Girard, S; Macina, D; Busa, M; Zafer, A; Belouchi, A; Gros, P; Vidal, SM								Susceptibility to mouse cytomegalovirus is associated with deletion of an activating natural killer cell receptor of the C-type lectin superfamily								NATURE GENETICS				28	1			42	45		10.1038/88247				MAY 2001	2001	Cytomegalovirus is the leading cause of congenital viral disease and the most important opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients(1,2). We have used a mouse experimental infection model (MCMV) to study the genetic parameters of host/virus interaction. Susceptibility to infection with MCMV is controlled by Cmv1, a chromosome 6 locus that regulates natural killer (NK) cell activity against virally infected targets(3-5). Here, we use a positional cloning strategy to isolate the gene mutated at the Cmv1 locus. Cmv1 maps within a 0.35-cM interval defined by markers D6Ott8 and D6Ott115, which corresponds to a physical distance of 1.6 Mb (refs. 6-8). A transcript map of the region identified 19 genes(8), including members of the killer cell lectin-like receptor family a (Klra, formerly Ly49; refs. 9-12), which encode inhibitory or activating NK cell receptors that interact with MHC class I molecules(13-15). Klra genes have different copy numbers and genomic organization, and are highly polymorphic among inbred strains, making it difficult to distinguish between normal allelic variants and distinct Klra genes(15-17), or possible mutations associated with Cmv1. The recombinant inbred strain BXD-8/Ty (BXD-8; ref. 18), derived from Cmv1(r) C57BL/6 (B6, resistant) and Cmv1(s) DBA/2 (susceptible), is of particular interest because it is highly susceptible to MCMV infection despite having a B6 haplotype at Cmv1, We determined that MCMV susceptibility in BXD-8 is associated with the deletion of Klra8 (formerly Ly49h).

Italy and Germany. Isolation of TOV in vitro has not yet been achieved and the transmission mechanisms are still unknown. In the experimental infection of pregnant goats described here, TOV could not be detected in secretion/excretion samples or fetal blood. Material from the goat experiment was used as inoculum for propagating the virus in vitro. To enhance the infectivity of TOV several modified protocols, e.g. pretreatment of the virus with trypsin, polyethylene glycol-mediated infection and lipofection were applied. Isolation of TOV, attempts to infect Culicoides nubeculosus by feeding TOV-positive blood and intracerebral inoculation of newborn mice were unsuccessful. The results of these studies suggest that TOV requires specific but different factors than other BTVs for infection and replication outside of its natural caprine host. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Siglec-H inhibits TLR9-induced IFN-alpha production by pDCs. Previously, it was found that Siglec-H-deficient mice develop a lupus-like severe autoimmune disease after persistent murine cytomegalovirus (mCMV) infection. This was due to enhanced type I interferon responses, including IFN-alpha. Here we examined, whether other virus infections can also induce autoimmunity in Siglec-H-deficient mice. To this end we infected Siglec-H-deficient mice with influenza virus or with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13. With both types of viruses we did not observe induction of autoimmune disease in Siglec-H-deficient mice. This can be explained by the fact that both types of viruses are ssRNA viruses that engage TLR7, rather than TLR9. Also, Influenza causes an acute infection that is rapidly cleared and the chronicity of LCMV clone 13 may not be sufficient and may rather suppress pDC functions. Siglec-H inhibited exclusively TLR-9 driven type I interferon responses, but did not affect type II or type III interferon production by pDCs. Siglec-H-deficient pDCs showed impaired Hck expression, which is a Src-family kinase expressed in myeloid cells, and downmodulation of the chemokine receptor CCR9, that has important functions for pDCs. Accordingly, Siglec-H-deficient pDCs showed impaired migration towards the CCR9 ligand CCL25. Furthermore, autoimmune-related genes such as Klk1 and DNase1l3 are downregulated in Siglec-H-deficient pDCs as well. From these findings we conclude that Siglec-H controls TLR-9-dependent, but not TLR-7 dependent inflammatory responses after virus infections and regulates chemokine responsiveness of pDCs.

A Novel Model for Papillomavirus-Mediated Anal Disease and Cancer Using the Mouse Papillomavirus								MBIO				12	4					e01611-21	10.1128/mBio.01611-21				JUL-AUG 2021	2021	Up to 95% of all anal cancers are associated with infection by human papillomavirus (HPV); however, no established preclinical model exists for high-grade anal disease and cancer mediated by a natural papillomavirus infection. To establish an infection-mediated model, we infected both immunocompromised NSG and immunocompetent FVB/NJ mice with the recently discovered murine papillomavirus MmuPV1, with and without the additional cofactors of UV B radiation (UVB) and/or the chemical carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA). Infections were tracked via lavages and swabs for MmuPV1 DNA, and pathology was assessed at the endpoint. Tissues were analyzed for biomarkers of viral infection and papillomavirus-mediated disease, and the localization of viral infection was investigated using bio-markers to characterize the anal microanatomical zones.IMPORTANCE We show, for the first time, that MmuPV1 infection is sufficient to effi- ciently mediate high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in the anal tract of mice using the NSG immunocompromised strain and that MmuPV1, in combination with the chemical carcinogen DMBA, has carcinogenic potential. We further show that MmuPV1 is able to persist for up to 6 months in the anal tract of FVB/NJ mice irradi-ated with UVB and contributes to high-grade disease and cancer in an immunocom-petent strain. We demonstrate that MmuPV1 preferentially localizes to the anal tran-sition zone and that this localization is not an artifact of infection methodology. This study presents a valuable new preclinical model for studying papillomavirus-medi-ated anal disease driven by a natural infection.																					WOS:000696627000003	34281391

Evaluation of safety and efficacy of RNAi against HIV-1 in the human immune system (Rag-2(-/-)gamma(-/-)(c)) mouse model								GENE THERAPY				16	1			148	153		10.1038/gt.2008.124				JAN 2009	2009	RNA interference (RNAi) gene therapy against HIV-1 by stable expression of antiviral short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can potently inhibit viral replication in T cells. Recently, a mouse model with a human immune system (HIS) was developed that can be productively infected with HIV-1. In this in vivo model, in which Rag-2 ' gamma(c)' mice are engrafted with human CD34(+)CD38 hematopoietic precursor cells, we evaluated an anti-HIV RNAi gene therapy. Human hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing an shRNA against the HIV-1 nef gene (shNef) or the control vector. We observed normal development of the different cell subsets of the immune system. However, although initial transduction efficiencies were similar for both vectors, a reduced percentage of transduced human immune cells was observed for the shNef vector after establishment of the HIS in vivo. Further studies are required to fully evaluate the safety implications. When we infected the mature human CD4(+) T cells from the HIS mouse ex vivo with HIV-1, potent inhibition of viral replication was scored in shNef- expressing cells, confirming efficacy. When challenged with an shNef- resistant HIV-1 variant, equal replication was scored in control and shNef- expressing cells, confirming sequence-specificity of the RNAi therapy. We thus demonstrated that an antiviral RNAi-based gene therapy on blood stem cells leads to HIV-1-resistant T cells in vivo, an important proof of concept in the clinical development of RNAi against HIV-1.

RVFV Clone 13, a naturally attenuated clone, is a promising vaccine which was used during the 2009-2010 outbreak in South Africa and played a key role in the control of the disease. In this work, we infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with RVFV Clone 13 and prepared salivary gland extracts (SGE). C57BL/6-NRJ male mice were infected with a mixture of SGE infected by Clone 13 and the ZH548 RVFV strain. With the injection of increasing doses of Clone 13-infected SGE, all mice were protected. Our results suggest Clone 13 infected SGE contain unique antiviral components able to counteract the replication of RVFV when injected into vertebrates. (C) 2014 Institut Pasteur.

We show here that dogs experimentally infected with CIV only developed respiratory tract diseases, as no extrapulmonary lesions and virus antigens were detected. This differs from the multiorgan diseases that avian influenza H5N1 induces in small experimental animals. However, the CIV-infected dogs developed a distinctively severe, long-persistent bronchointerstitial pneumonia, which differs from the acute but short-term bronchopneumonia that human (H1N1 and H3N2) influenza cause in rodents and ferrets. Histopathology and in situ TUNEL assays revealed that the neutrophils infiltrating the lesions were undergoing apoptosis, which probably reflects the attempts by the body to maintain appropriate numbers of neutrophils for defense against secondary bacterial infections. Our observations suggest that neutrophils along with the related chemoattractant cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-8, etc.) may play a key role in the pathogenesis of H3N2 CIV in dogs.

Airway mucosal inflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of RSV disease in both natural and experimental infections. RSV is among the most potent biological stimuli that induce the expression of inflammatory genes, including those encoding chemokines, but the mechanism(s) that controls virus-mediated airway inflammation in vivo has not been fully elucidated. Herein we show that the inoculation of BALB/c mice with RSV results in rapid activation of the multisubunit IkappaB kinase (IKK) in lung tissue. IKK trans-duces upstream activating signals into the rate-limiting phosphorylation (and proteolytic degradation) of IkappaBalpha, the inhibitory subunit that under normal conditions binds to the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB complex and keeps it in an inactive cytoplasmic form. Mice treated intranasally with interleukin-10 or with a specific cell-permeable peptide that blocks the association of the catalytic subunit IKKbeta with the regulatory protein NEMO showed a striking reduction of lung NF-kappaB DNA binding activity, chemokine gene expression, and airway inflammation in response to RSV infection. These findings suggest that IKKbeta may be a potential target for the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory diseases of the lung.																					WOS:000189019300007	14963119

This chip does not require DNA labeling, and the hybridization signal can be detected as an anodic current. The average anodic currents of 9 (Cp), 5 (Hb), 8 (Hh) and 7 (MHV) PCR positive samples derived from feces of spontaneously infected mice (Cp, Hb and Hh) and MHV-contaminated tumor cells were 27.9 +/- 7.2, 31.9 +/- 8.1, 29.3 +/- 10.1, and 27.6 +/- 3.0 nA, respectively. On the other hand, the average anodic currents of 19 (Cp), 27 (Hb), 18 (Hh), and 13 (MHV) PCR negative samples were 0.3 +/- 2.9, 3.7 +/- 2.4, -1.0 +/- 1.7, and -2.3 +/- 2.7 nA, respectively. The anodic current increased with increasing concentrations of pathogens. For experimentally infected samples, the results of PCR/electrophoresis were in complete accord with those of this system when anodic currents of 6.1 (Cp), 8.5 (Hb), 2.4 (Hh), and 3.1 nA (MHV) were taken as the cut-off value. The results suggested that the electrochemical DNA chip system is useful for specific and quantitative detection of PCR products. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Within each major antigenic type of influenza virus (A, B and C) these antibodies are strictly specific of the HA and NA characterizing variable sub-types, which appear in the course of time from an epidemic to the next one. There exists however a cell-mediated facet of immunity : study of the experimental infection of laboratory mice with mouse-adapted viruses has shown that this cellular immunity is type-specific and therefore covers all the sub-types of a given type of virus. This heterologous immunity is primarily mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) which recognize an internal nucleoprotein (NP) common to all the sub-types. These CTL are able to lyse influenza virus-infected cells and contribute to local production of interferon in the course of infection. Such mechanisms likely play a major role in the natural resistance of the host to this infection. Thanks to the molecular characterization of the NP protein, it is now possible to conceive the design of vaccines endowed with a wider spectrum than those presently used ; in association with the latter, it should become possible in the future to stimulate efficiently both facets of anti-influenza immunity.

J	AKOWITZ, A; MANUELIDIS, EE; MANUELIDIS, L								PROTECTED ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRAL SEQUENCES COPURIFY WITH INFECTIVITY IN EXPERIMENTAL CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB-DISEASE								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				130	3-4			301	316		10.1007/BF01309662				1993	1993	Scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) are caused by infectious agents that are defined phenomenologically. No agent-specific molecules or particles have been identified. Biological properties, such as exponential agent replication and strain variation, as well as physical characteristics of infectivity indicate a protected viral structure. A host membrane glycoprotein of 34 kDa (''prion'' protein) that aggregates at end stages of disease is clearly important in pathology and susceptibility to infection, but has no demonstrable infectivity in any purified or recombinant form. Thus a characterization of more viral-like molecules is important. In order to identify viral-like nucleic acids we previously developed methods to substantially purify the human CJD agent from experimentally infected hamster brains, and demonstrated selected retroviral-like LTR bands at pg levels that were insufficient for sequencing. To further define these and other viral-like sequences we cloned nucleic acids from highly infectious CJD fractions, and tested the efficacy of our methods using a selected retroviral probe. RNA extracted from an infectious 120 S Gaussian peak, which is reproducibly purified approximately 100,000 fold with respect to starting nucleic acids, and contains approximately 20% of the initial brain infectivity, was used to generate a cDNA library in a sequence independent amplification strategy for low levels of RNA (< 6 ng). Reconstituted strong stop experiments using several retroviral tRNA primers had indicated that Syrian hamster IAP (SHIAP) sequences should be present in both CJD and uninfected control fractions. Because SHIAP particles are extremely resistant to denaturation, their representation in a cDNA library would imply adequate extraction of other protected RNAs of viral origin. At least 900 bases of the Syrian hamster retroviral IAP genome were unambiguously identified in the cDNA library, and in independent PCR walks with selected primers, all of which were based on our cloned sequences. Sequencing confirmed the presence of protected LTR and adjacent retroviral motifs. Because these sequences were also present in control preparations they may represent normal endogenous viral contaminants that cosediment with infectivity in size and density gradients. On the other hand, LTRs can drive the expression of many diverse sequences, and it remains to be seen if CJD specific sequences are either transduced, or copackaged with, protected IAP complexes. The effective extraction and amplification of highly protected SHIAP nucleic acids of significant length sets the stage for identifying additional protected viral elements that may specify the CJD agent.

Out of the 27 H9 virus isolates, the hemagglutinins of 18 strains were genetically classified as belonging to the sublineage G1, and the other nine belonged to the Korean sublineage. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one of the 27 H9 viruses was a reassortant in which the PB2 gene belonged to the Korean sublineage and the other seven genes belonged to the G1 sublineage. Three representative H9N2 viruses were intranasally inoculated into ducks, chickens, pigs, and mice. On the basis of experimental infection studies, it was found that each of the three viruses readily infected pigs and replicated in their upper respiratory tracts, and they infected chickens with slight replication. Viruses were recovered from the lungs of mice inoculated with two of the three isolates. The present results reveal that H9 avian influenza viruses are prevailing and genetic reassortment occurs among domestic ducks in Vietnam. It is recommended that careful surveillance of swine influenza with H9 viruses should be performed to prepare for pandemic influenza.																					WOS:000299844500005	22068881

Human cases of SEOV virus infection have most recently been reported in the USA, United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands and were primarily associated with contact with pet rats and feeder rats. Infection of rats results in an asymptomatic but persistent infection. Little is known about the cell tropism of SEOV in its reservoir and most available data is based on experimental infection studies in which rats were inoculated via a route which does not recapitulate virus transmission in nature. Here we report the histopathological analysis of SEOV cell tropism in key target organs following natural infection of a cohort of feeder rats, comprising 19 adults and 11 juveniles. All adult rats in this study were positive for SEOV specific antibodies and viral RNA in their tissues. One juvenile rat was seropositive, but negative in the rRT-PCR. Of the 19 adult rats of which subsequently additional organs were tested, SEOV RNA was detected in all lungs, followed by kidney (79%) and liver (74%). Histopathologic changes associated with SEOV infection were primarily found in the liver, consistent with a pathological diagnosis of a mild hepatitis. In conclusion, natural SEOV infection results in mild inflammation of the liver in the absence of clinical disease.																					WOS:000475308000049	31181690

In this study, we asked whether SP-A and SP-D enhance clearance of a nonmucoid strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the lungs. We infected mice deficient in SP-A (SP-A-/-), SP-D (SP-D-/-) and both pulmonary collectins (SP-AD-/-) by intratracheal administration of P. aeruginosa. Six hours after infection, bacterial counts were significantly higher in SP-A-/-, SP-D-/-, and SP-AD-/- compared with wild-type (WT) mice. Forty-eight hours after infection, bacterial counts were significantly higher in SP-A-/- mice compared with WT mice and in SP-AD-/- mice compared with WT, SP-A-/-, and SP-D-/- mice. Phagocytosis of the bacteria by alveolar macrophages was decreased in SP-A-/- and SP-D-/- mice. Levels of macrophage inflammatory peptide-2 and IL-6 were more elevated in the lungs of SP-D and SP-AD-/- mice compared with WT mice. There was more infiltration by neutrophils in the lungs of SP-D-/- compared with WT and SP-A-/- mice 48 h after infection. This study shows that SP-A and SP-D enhance pulmonary clearance of P. aeruginosa by stimulating phagocytosis by alveolar macrophages and by modulating the inflammatory response in the lungs. These findings also show that the functions of SP-A and SP-D are not completely redundant in vivo.																					WOS:000237962300011	16456184
