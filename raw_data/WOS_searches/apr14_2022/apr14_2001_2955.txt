J	FAZEKAS de ST. GROTH, S.								Studies in experimental immunology of influenza. I. The state of virus receptors and inhibitors in the respiratory tract								AUSTRALIAN JOUR EXPTL BIOL AND MED SCI				28	(1)			15	29						1950	1950	In mice exptlly. infected with influenza virus the number of available virus-receptors in the respiratory tract drops during the acute phase of the disease. Measurable receptor destruction starts at the time when virus concn. in the lungs has attained its maximum; its extent is proportional to the size of the infective dose. Coinciding with the appearance of specific antibody and the decrease in the virus content of the lungs, regeneration of receptors is demonstrable. Evidence is furnished that this regeneration starts earlier but is partly masked by the presence of enzymically active virus capable of maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between destruction and regeneration of receptors. The mucoid inhibitor for heated Lee virus normally present in the respiratory tract, disappears within 48 hrs. after infection and does not reappear until the 6th day. During the early stages of recovery (8th-20th day) the amt. of inhibitor in bronchial washings is approx. 10 times more than in normal mice. Admn. of large doses of killed virus vaccines (nasally, peritoneally or subcut.), or of live virus by routes other than the nasal, does not cause any change in the number of available receptors or the inhibitor content of the respiratory tract. The mechanism of infection by and resistance to influenza viruses is discussed in the light of the findings, and the conclusion is reached that the changes described are insufficient to cause any difference in the host's susceptibility to super-or re-infection. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19502400036750	15420097

Previously, we found that the consensus hemagglutinin DNA vaccine (pCHA5) can only elicit moderate neutralization activities toward the H5N1 clade 2.1 and clade 2.3 viruses. Two approaches were thus taken to improve the protection broadness of CHA5. The first one was to include certain surface amino acids that are characteristic of clade 2.3 viruses to improve the protection profiles. When we immunized mice with CHA5 harboring individual mutations, the antibodies elicited by CHA5 containing P157S elicited higher neutralizing activity against the clade 2.3 viruses. Likewise, the viruses pseudotyped with hemagglutinin containing 157S became more susceptible to neutralization. The second approach was to update the consensus sequence with more recent H5N1 strains, generating a second-generation DNA vaccine pCHA5II. We showed that pCHA5II was able to elicit higher cross-neutralization activities against all H5N1 viruses. Comparison of the neutralization profiles of CHA5 and CHA5II, and the animal challenge studies, revealed that CHA5II induced the broadest protection profile. We concluded that CHA5II combined with electroporation delivery is a promising strategy to induce antibodies with broad cross-reactivities against divergent H5N1 influenza viruses.

Biology and diseases								271	306						1979	1979	Although humoral antibodies to many viruses have been found in rats, not many viruses are known to be naturally infective for laboratory rats. This paper, therefore, is concerned mainly with rat parvoviruses, rat coronaviruses and Sendai virus; oncogenic viruses of rats are not discussed. Although rats are not commonly used for virological investigations, a short section deals with examples of experimental infections. The section on detection, diagnosis and control of virus infections in rat colonies is especially valuable.																					CABI:19802256727

MULTIDIRECTIONAL EFFECT OF MIF AND SODIUM POLYPRENYL PHOSPHATE ON THE COURSE OF EXPERIMENTAL FLAVIVIRUS INFECTION IN MICE								Zhurnal Mikrobiologii Epidemiologii i Immunobiologii					5			56	61						SEP-OCT 2011	2011	Aim. Study of macrophage migration inhibiting factor (MIF) effect after intracerebral administration on the course of experimental infection induced in mice by tick borne encephalitis virus (TEV), and study of sodium polyprenyl phosphate (PPP) and/or antibodies against M IF on the course of this infection against the background of MIF administration. Materials and methods. Phosprenil preparation was used as. a source of PPP. PPP was administered intracerebrally. MIF human recombinant (R&D, USA), mice - Balb/c line. Results.. In the sera of mice infected with TEV, M IF production stimulation was detected at days 8 through 10 after the infection - against the background of clinical signs presentation of tick borne encephalitis (TE). Administration of PPP to infected mice, on the contrary, resulted in M IF production suppression at the specified period. After administration of 20 ng of MIF to mice, lethality increased by 40% and average life span decreased by 2.3 days. Thus, MIF at high doses caused an increase of infection course severity, induced by ITV in mice, and administration of 60 mu g of PPP resulted in the protection from infection in 100% of cases. Intracerebral administration to mice of antibodies against MIF resulted in a decrease of lethality indicator up to 26% as compared with control and an increase of average life span by 5.5 days. During simultaneous administration into the brain of infected mice of MIF, PPP and antibodies against M IF, prevention of M IF-induced increase of TE course severity was registered. Conclusion. The data obtained allow to conclude that MIF may serve as an indicator of TE course severity, and possible prognostic indicator of meningo-encephalitic form development in humans.

This report characterizes the antigenic and biological properties of the H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from chickens, ducks, and geese from farms and poultry markets in Hong Kong during 1997 and compares them with those of virus isolated from the index human case. Each of the H5N1 viruses from Hong Kong poultry markets that were tested were lethal in chickens, possessed polybasic amino acids at the carboxy-terminus of HAI, and by definition were highly pathogenic in poultry. The available nonpathogenic H5 influenza viruses and the pathogenic H5N1 virus from Hong Kong were analyzed with monoclonal antibodies prepared to A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (H5N2). The analysis revealed limited antigenic drift in 15 years and established that monoclonal antibodies are useful reagents for identification and antigenic analysis of avian strains that may transmit to humans in the future. One of the monoclonal antibodies permitted separation of the H5N1 influenza viruses from poultry into two groups that correlated with the presence or absence of a carbohydrate at residue 158 adjacent to the receptor binding site on HA. The H5N1 viruses examined replicated in geese, pigs, rats, and mice, but to only a very limited extent in ducks. It is noteworthy that all infected geese shed virus and that the H5N1 viruses caused disease signs and death in a portion (3 of 16) of the geese, with evidence of systemic spread to the brain. The tropism for geese is unusual and may provide insight into the origin of these viruses. In mice, the H5N1 virus caused lethal pneumonia and spread systemically to the brain. Mice would thus provide an ideal model system for studying immune responses and pathogenesis. Transmission experiments in chickens revealed that the H5N1 viruses are spread by fecal-oral transmission rather than by aerosol, and that the viruses are inactivated by drying of feces at ambient temperature. However, infectivity is maintained for at least 4 days in wet feces at 25 degrees C. There were differences in the morphology of the H5N1 viruses isolated from birds and humans. The perpetuation of H5N1 influenza viruses in the poultry markets in Hong Kong and the transmission of these viruses to humans emphasize the importance of these markets in the epidemiology of influenza. The poultry markets are of critical importance in the perpetuation and transmission of influenza viruses to other avian species and to mammals, including humans.

Ironically, infections caused by viruses related to smallpox are being increasingly reported worldwide, including Monkeypox, Cowpox, and Vaccinia virus (VACV). Little is known about the human immunological responses elicited during acute infections caused by orthopoxviruses. We have followed VACV zoonotic outbreaks taking place in Brazil and analyzed cellular immune responses in patients acutely infected by VACV. Results indicated that these patients show a biased immune modulation when compared to noninfected controls. Amounts of B cells are low and less activated in infected patients. Although present, T CD4(+) cells are also less activated when compared to noninfected individuals, and so are monocytes/macrophages. Similar results were obtained when Balb/C mice were experimentally infected with a VACV sample isolated during the zoonotic outbreaks. Taking together, the data suggest that zoonotic VACVs modulate specific immune cell compartments during an acute infection in humans.																					WOS:000298820300001	22229039

Zika virus infection of pregnant rats and associated neurological consequences in the offspring								PLOS ONE				14	6					e0218539	10.1371/journal.pone.0218539				JUN 20 2019	2019	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus associated with microcephaly and other neurological disorders in infants born to infected mothers. Despite being declared an international emergency by the World Health Organization, very little is known about the mechanisms of ZIKV pathogenesis or the long-term consequences of maternal ZIKV infection in the affected offspring, largely due to the lack of appropriate rodent models. To address this issue, our lab has developed a working model of prenatal ZIKV infection in rats. In this study, we infected immune competent pregnant female rats with 10(5)-10(7) PFU of ZIKV (PRVABC59, Puerto Rico/Human/Dec 2015) in order to examine its pathogenesis in the dams and pups. We examined the febrile response and sickness behavior in the dams, in addition to neonatal mortality, microglia morphology, cortical organization, apoptosis, and brain region-specific volumes in the offspring. Here, we demonstrate that pregnant and non-pregnant female rats have a distinct febrile response to ZIKV infection. Moreover, prenatal ZIKV infection increased cell death and reduced tissue volume in the hippocampus and cortex in the neonatal offspring. For the first time, we demonstrate the efficacy and validity of an immunocompetent rat model for maternal ZIKV infection that results in significant brain malformations in the neonatal offspring.

We found that both WZ83 and WZ101 caused lethal infection in chickens but WZ101 killed them more rapidly than WZ83. Interestingly, ducks experimentally infected with WZ83 showed no or only mild clinical symptoms, whereas WZ101 was highly lethal. We then generated reassortants between these viruses and found that exchange of the M gene segment completely switched the pathogenic phenotype in both chickens and ducks, indicating that the difference in the pathogenicity for these avian species between WZ83 and WZ101 was determined by only a single amino acid in the M1 protein. It was also found that WZ101 showed higher pathogenicity than WZ83 in mice and that WZ83, whose M gene was replaced with that of WZ101, showed higher pathogenicity than wild-type WZ83, although this reassortant virus was not fully pathogenic compared to wild-type WZ101. These results suggest that the amino acid at position 43 of the M1 protein is one of the factors contributing to the pathogenicity of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in both avian and mammalian hosts.

J	Paweska, Janusz T.; van Vuren, Petrus Jansen; Swanepoel, Robert								Validation of an indirect ELISA based on a recombinant nucleocapsid protein of Rift Valley fever virus for the detection of IgG antibody in humans								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS				146	1-2			119	124		10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.06.006				DEC 2007	2007	An indirect enzyme-linked immunoassay (I-ELISA) based on the recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rNp) of Rift Valley fever virus was validated for the detection of specific IgG antibody in human sera. Validation data sets derived from testing sera collected in Africa (n = 2967) were categorized according to the results of a virus neutralisation test. The assay had high intra- and inter-plate repeatability in routine runs. No detectable cross-reactions between IgG antibodies generated from mice experimentally infected with viruses representing genus Phlebovirus, Nairovirus, Orthobunyavirus and Bhanja virus of the family Bunyaviridae were observed. At a cut-off optimised by the two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis at 95% accuracy level, the diagnostic sensitivity of the I-ELISA was 99.72% and diagnostic specificity 99.62% while estimates for the Youden's index (J) and efficiency (Ef) were 0.993 and 99.62%. When cut-off values determined by mean plus two and by mean plus three standard deviations derived from I-ELISA readings in an uninfected reference population were used, the diagnostic sensitivity was 100% but estimates of Y, Ef and other combined measures of diagnostic accuracy were lower. The I-ELISA based on rNp is highly sensitive, specific and robust and can be applied for diagnosis of infection of Rift Valley fever and disease-surveillance studies in humans. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In contrast, mice exposed to infectious virus rather than virus-infected cells generate little, if any, antiviral CTL activity. In this report, we show that inoculation of B6 or B6.Fv-1(n) mice with MuLV prior to priming with H-2-matched AKR/Gross virus antigen-positive tumor cells resulted in a profound inhibition of the virus-specific CTL response. Antiallogeneic major and minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CTL responses were not significantly diminished in MuLV-infected mice. The AKR/Gross MuLV-specific CTL response in B6 mice was inhibited by NB-tropic (SL3-3(NB), Friend and Moloney), but not N-tropic (AKR623) MuLV, suggesting that productive infection of host cells was required. We were unable to inhibit the in vitro generation of virus-specific CTL by adding modulator cells from virus-infected mice to mixed lymphocyte-tumor cell cultures (MLTC) of spleen cells from uninfected animals. We also failed to augment CTL generation in MLTC from virus-infected animals by adding exogenous IL-2 or CD4(+) lymphocytes from uninfected, tumor-primed mice. Taken together, the data suggested that the inhibition resulted from either a direct or an indirect effect on the in vivo priming of virus-specific CD8(+) cells. It is therefore interesting that MuLV such as Friend and Moloney, which do not encode the immunodominant epitope recognized by anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL, are nonetheless able to specifically inhibit this response. These results demonstrate a potentially important mechanism by which retroviruses may escape CTL-mediated immunity.																					WOS:A1996UW05800005	8822627

Dissertation Abstracts International				36B	12			6010	6010						1976	1976	Following experimental infection of SPF ponies with equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV) serum, neutralizing antibody, lymphocyte blastogenesis and positive skin tests were demonstrated. Cytotoxicity associated with serum, peripheral blood leucocytes in autologous serum and washed peripheral blood leucocytes were also demonstrated. The infection of hamsters with a hamster adapted strain of EHV was used as a model system to evaluate the efficacy of various preparations of immune serum and cells in conferring immunity. Hamsters could be passively protected against challenge with virus by the prior adoptive transfer of immune spleen cells, immune peritoneal exudate cells or immune rabbit serum but not by the transfer of immune thymus cells. A combination of immune spleen cells and antiserum conferred the highest protection. Macrophages from immune animals when established in cultures and infected with virus yielded less virus than did macrophages derived from non-immune animals. It was concluded that immunity to EHV was both humoral and cell-mediated.																					CABI:19762277732

Mag. dilator.				15				210	214						1960	1960	The authors studied the lungs of slaughtered pigs, which had been affected with respiratory conditions. From subacute cases a virus was isolated together with a wide variety of staphylococci, pasteurella, salmonella, haemophilus, Corynebacterium pyogenes[Arcanobacterium pyogenes] and Escherichia coli in the more advanced cases. The virus was successfully propagated in 6 to 7-day-old chick embryos, and caused their death; it did not agglutinate the r.b.c. of hens, was susceptible to the broad spectrum antibiotics and caused lesions with mononuclear cell infiltration in the lungs of artificially infected pigs.On several farms a more acute respiratory disease was observed, the symptoms and P.M. lesions of which are described. From lungs affected with this condition another type of virus was isolated which was also successfully propagated in 13-day-old chick embryos and caused their death, and agglutinated the r.b.c. of hens, which agglutination could be inhibited by immune serum against type A human influenza virus (PR8), suggesting the presence of an identical antigen in the two viruses. Infection with the virus caused a temperature rise in ferrets and mild lung lesions in mice. Of 13 weanling piglets exposed to infection by various methods, 11 developed fever and various degrees of clinical symptoms; the virus was recovered from the lung lesions of 8, all infected via the trachea.From the brain of pigs from one farm the virus of Aujeszky's disease was isolated.The role of mismanagement and underfeeding as predisposing factors contributing to the pathogenicity of these viruses is discussed; good hygiene and the avoidance of the introduction of carriers are suggested as preventive measures.-A.

The development of pilomatricomas in mice experimentally infected with polyomavirus led us to detect the viral major capsid protein VP-1 in human pilomatricomas. This tumor, even uncommon, is one of the most frequent benign hair follicle tumors in humans and is composed of proliferating matrix cells that undergo keratinization, and form cystic neoplasms. The detection of VP-1 was performed using the peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique in paraffin-embedded slides with a specific primary serum. Adjacent slides treated with normal rabbit serum as a primary were employed as internal control. Positive and negative controls were also employed as well as slides of lesions caused by human papillomavirus to rule out any unspecific cross-reactivity. In 4 out of 10 cases polyomavirus VP-1 was clearly detected in nuclei of human pilomatricomas proliferating cells. in a patchy pattern of distribution. The controls confirmed the specificity of the immunocytochemical procedure. These results could indicate either an eventual infection of the virus in already developed tumors or alternatively, a direct involvement of polyomavirus in the pathogenesis of some pilomatricomas. The recent discovery of a new human polyomavirus associated with Merkel cell carcinomas has been a strong contribution to better understand the pathogenesis of some human uncommon skin cancers. Hopefully the results reported in this work will encourage further research on the role of polyomavirus in other human skin neoplasms.																					WOS:000278015100008	20447899

In mice injd. by any route except intraven., T. cruzi appeared in the blood in from 2 to 12 days. The parasites can be found at any time after intraven. injns. The majority of the mice developed severe subcut. edema during the acute stages. Marked swelling of the body was noted. This edema was not associated with lesions in the thyroid. Edema appears to occur in man, dogs, and mice[long dash]the only species in which T. cruzi causes pathological symptoms. The pathology of T. cruzi, based on data obtained from 100 mice, is discussed in great detail. The edema coincided with a large gain in body weight. A summary of the pathological findings is as follows generalized subcut. edema, generalized lymphadenopathy, acute diffuse myocarditis, endocarditis, valvulitis, focal hepatitis, acute systemic myosites, periphlebitis of the great veins, passive congestion and a moderate enlargement of the spleen. Leishmanoid forms were found in the heart, spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, testis. skeletal muscles, tongue, salivary glands, many lymph nodes, and in the subcut. tissues. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: B. B.

Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 Attenuates Reovirus Myocarditis and Contributes to Viral Clearance								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				84	14			6900	6908		10.1128/JVI.01742-09				JUL 2010	2010	Apoptosis is a pathological hallmark of encephalitis and myocarditis caused by reovirus in newborn mice. In cell culture models, the antiviral transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) enhances reovirus-induced apoptosis following activation via retinoic acid inducible gene I and interferon promoter-stimulating factor 1. To determine the role of IRF-3 in reovirus disease, we infected newborn IRF-3(+/+) and IRF-3(-/-) mice perorally with mildly virulent strain type 1 Lang (T1L) and fully virulent strain type 3 SA+ (T3SA+) and monitored infected animals for survival. Both wild-type and IRF-3(-/-) mice succumbed with equivalent frequencies to infection with T3SA+. However, the absence of IRF-3 was associated with significantly decreased survival rates following infection with T1L. The two virus strains achieved similar peak titers in IRF-3(+/+) and IRF-3(-/-) mice in the intestine, brain, heart, liver, and spleen. However, by day 12 postinoculation, titers in all organs examined were 10- to 100-fold higher in IRF-3(-/-) mice than those in wild-type mice. Increased titers were associated with marked pathological changes in all organs examined, especially in the heart, where absence of IRF-3 resulted in severe myocarditis. Cellular and humoral immune responses were equivalent in wild-type and IRF-3(-/-) animals, suggesting that IRF-3 functions independently of the adaptive immune response to enhance reovirus clearance. Thus, IRF-3 serves to facilitate virus clearance and prevent tissue injury in response to reovirus infection.																					WOS:000278935700001	20463082

After cotransfection of the shuttle vector pDC316-gC and Adenovirus DNA helper plasmid pBHGloxdelta E1, 3Cre into 293 cells, the recombinant Adenovirus expressing gC protein was obtained through homologous recombination and observation of remarkably cytopathic effect. Afterwards, high titres of recombinant Adenovirus designated as Adv-gC were prepared after PCR identification and virus purification. Glycoprotein gC gene expression was confirmed in Marc145 cells by immunofluorescent staining assay. Intramuscular immunization of Adv-gC could induce PRV specific humoral and cellular response in mice. In the experimentally infected animals, the group immunized by Adv-gC presented 100% protection efficiency as contrast to 0% obtained in the control group.																					CABI:20073160714

We infected BM cells of donor FVB mice with rAAV vectors containing the lacZ gene for 2 h. We then injected the rAAV-infected cells to lethally irradiated-recipient FVB mice. Peripheral blood (PB), BM and spleen harvested at 4 weeks after BM transplant (BMT) demonstrated stable engraftment in beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) expression. In contrast, Dil-labeling displayed only a faint signal 4 weeks after BMT. To analyze the kinetics of BM cells, we injected vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which promotes mobilization of BM cells. Administration of VEGF protein significantly increased the rAAV-mediated beta-gal expression in PB and BM of recipient mice. Moreover, when myocardial infarction was induced in BMT mice, the ischemic area exhibited significant P-gal staining in rAAV-labeled BMT group. rAAV vectors programmed stable transduction in BM cells in vivo through rapid infection. rAAV appears to represent a useful vector for labeling BM cells ex vivo prior to BMT for analysis of cardiovascular therapeutic purposes.

J	Szavay, PO; Leonhardt, J; Czech-Schmidt, G; Petersen, C								The role of reovirus type 3 infection in an established murine model for biliary atresia								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY				12	4			248	250		10.1055/s-2002-34477				AUG 2002	2002	Aim of the study: Infection of newborn Balb/c-mice with Rhesus rotavirus (RRV) leads to cholestasis and biliary atresia. In this current model, Reovirus Type 3 was investigated to ascertain whether Reovirus Type 3 causes the same or similar hepatobiliary lesions as RRV.Methods: Newborn Balb/c-mice were infected with Reovirus Type 3 Dearing and Reovirus Type 3 Abney on the first day of life. Clinical observation followed for a period of at least 10 days. Cholestatic and/or dystrophic mice were prepared and specimens were taken for histological examination.Results: Infection with RRV showed a 85% morbidity for biliary atresia as described before. Clinical disease, following an infection with Reovirus T3 Dearing, showed neurological symptoms such as ataxia, and all mice died within 3 weeks. No obstructive or atretic changes of the hepatobiliary ducts could be seen either.; macroscopically or histomorphologically. 60% of the mice having been infected with Reovirus T3 Abney showed signs of cholestasis and oily fur syndrome, but almost 15% recovered from the disease. Although the histological findings did not reveal biliary atresia, inflammation and destruction of bile ducts could be observed.Conclusion: In comparison to the RRV infection in a Balb/c-mice model, where biliary atresia could be induced, infection with Reovirus T3 in this model did not lead to biliary atresia. But Reovirus T3 Abney infection revealed inflammatory signs as described in the literature before. The question as to why different hepatotrophic viruses lead to different changes in the murine hepatobiliary tract has to be investigated in further studies.					4th European Congress of Paediatric Surgery4th European Congress of Paediatric Surgery	MAY 03-05, 2001MAY 03-05, 2001		BUDAPEST, HUNGARYBUDAPEST, HUNGARY													WOS:000178413500008	12369002

Nine of the 10 most abundant mosquito species collected in light traps were fed on blood containing the B94/20 strain RR isolated. from Queensland in 1994. All species except for Culex sitiens Wiedemann were susceptible to experimental infection. Evidence of RR virus transmission to mice was found with Aedes vigilax (Skuse), Aedes funereus (Theobald), Aedes procax (Skuse), Culex annulirostris Skuse, Mansonia uniformis (Theobald) and Culex australicus Dobrotworsky & Drummond. Aedes notoscriptus (Skuse) and Aedes multiplex (Theobald) were susceptible to RR virus infection, although there was no evidence of virus transmission. Based on adult abundance and vector competence results, freshwater species such as Cx. annulirostris, Ae. procax, and Ae. funereus, and saltmarsh Ae. vigilax, appear to be important vectors of RR virus in Maroochy Shire and control programs should be revised to include these species.

Since coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is cardiotropic, it may be possible to exploit its cardiotropic characteristics to design a vector for gene transfer to the intact heart. We generated a recombinant CVB3 cDNA by inserting a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene immediately upstream from the VP0 capsid protein of CVB3. The infectious virus (rCVB3-GFP) was recovered from the supernatants of the transfected Cos-7 cells, and was grown in HeLa cells to titers of 10(11) pfu/ml. In the rCVB3-GFP infected HeLa cells and neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, GFP protein expression was documented by immunoblot and by fluorescent microscopy. GFP expression was maintained after five passages in HeLa cells. To test in vivo expression of GFP, we infected 8-week-old inbred female Balb/C mice with 10(6) pfu of rCVB3-GFP, intraperitoneally. GFP was present in up to 30% of cardiac myocytes over the 8 weeks post infection, (p.i.) and it was co-localized with CVB3 infection. Surprisingly, in spite of detection of GFP up to at least 8 weeks after infection, there was no mortality in the mice. It is possible to express exogenous proteins in the intact heart after an intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of recombinant coxsackievirus. The duration of expression persisted for at least 8 weeks with little immune response nor mortality. These results demonstrated that the cardiac tropism of CVB3 could be used to design vectors for efficient gene expression in the intact heart. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Two different virus infection-specific antigens with molecular weights of 24 kD and 35/38 kD (double band) could be demonstrated using antigen preparations from persistently infected cells and rat brains, and polyvalent antisera from naturally and experimentally infected animals. Three different monoclonal antibodies were selected. One was specific for the 24-kD protein and two others reacted with the 35/38-kD antigen. The 24- and 35/38-kD antigens could be monitored concomitantly with the appearance of newly synthesized infectious virus. Both antigens could be detected at the same time during the infection cycle, and showed identical distribution in the cell. Their relationship to one another and their possible function is discussed.																					WOS:A1991FA67300002	2038820

Rats that were experimentally infected by the intraperitoneal route showed transient immunoglobulin M (IgM) production, followed by an increased anti-SEOV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response and maturation of IgG avidity. The level of SEOV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) peaked at 6 days after inoculation and the viral genome disappeared from serum. In contrast, naturally infected brown rats simultaneously had a high rate of SEOV-specific IgM and IgG antibodies (28/43). Most of the IgM-positive rats (24/27) had the SEOV genome in their lungs, suggesting that chronic SEOV infection was established in those rats. In female rats with IgG avidity maturation, the viral load in the lungs was decreased. On the other hand, there was no relationship between IgG avidity and viral load in the lungs in male rats. A CTL response was not detected in naturally infected rats. The difference between immune responses in the experimentally and naturally infected rats is associated with the establishment of chronic infection in natural hosts.

To study the possible role of the virus dose, and of antiviral antibodies in the development of CB1 myositis, we infected groups of newborn mice with six CB1 doses, ranging from 30 to 10,000 plaque forming units (pfu); after 4 and 8 weeks we determined morbidity and antiviral antibody titer, and quantified histopathological changes. At 4 weeks, morbidity and mononuclear cell infiltration differed significantly for the various groups, with the most prominent changes in 300 pfu animals. At 4 and 8 weeks diseased animals had significantly higher antibody titers than clinically unaffected animals, and at 4 weeks myopathic and infiltrative changes correlated positively with the serum antibody titer. Our data indicate that the virus dose plays a pathogenic role in CB1 myositis, and they suggest further study on the role of humoral immune mechanisms in the early phase of CB1 myositis.

Both viruses belong to the genus Seadornavirus, family Reoviridae. LNV causes lethal haemorrhage in experimentally infected mice. Twenty seven isolates of LNV were made from mosquitoes collected in different locations within the Xinjiang province of north-western China during 2005. These mosquitoes were caught in the accommodation of human patients with febrile manifestations, or in animal barns where sheep represent the main livestock species. The regions where LNV was isolated are affected by seasonal encephalitis, but are free of Japanese encephalitis (JE). Genome segment 10 (Seg-10) (encoding cell-attachment and serotype-determining protein VP10) and Seg-12 (encoding non-structural protein VP12) were sequenced for multiple LNV isolates. Phylogenetic analyses showed a less homogenous Seg-10 gene pool, as compared to segment 12. However, all of these isolates appear to belong to LNV type-1. These data suggest a relatively recent introduction of LNV into Xinjiang province, with substitution rates for LNV Seg-10 and Seg-12, respectively, of 2.29x10(-4) and 1.57x10(-4) substitutions/nt/year. These substitution rates are similar to those estimated for other dsRNA viruses. Our data indicate that the history of LNV is characterized by a lack of demographic fluctuations. However, a decline in the LNV population in the late 1980s - early 1990s, was indicated by data for both Seg-10 and Seg-12. Data also suggest a beginning of an expansion in the late 1990s as inferred from Seg-12 skyline plot.																					WOS:000305335800074	22649554

A majority of outbreaks of congenital tremors have been attributed to an unidentified virus. The objectives of this project were to 1) detect potential pathogen(s) in samples from piglets with congenital tremors and 2) develop an infection model to reproduce disease. Using next-generation sequencing, a divergent lineage pestivirus was detected in piglets with congenital tremors. The virus was originally most closely related to a bat pestivirus but is now more closely related to a recently published novel porcine pestivirus provisionally named atypical porcine pestivirus. A quantitative real-time PCR detected the virus in samples from neonatal piglets with congenital tremors from two separate farms, but not in samples from unaffected piglets from the same farm. To fulfill the second objective, pregnant sows were inoculated with either serum containing the pestivirus or PBS (control) by intravenous and intranasal routes simultaneously with direct inoculation of fetal amniotic vesicles by ultrasound-guided surgical technique. Inoculations were performed at either 45 or 62 days of gestation. All sows inoculated with the novel pestivirus farrowed piglets affected with congenital tremors while PBS-inoculated control piglets were unaffected. Tremor severity for each piglet was scored from videos taken 0, 1 and 2 days post-farrowing. Tremor severity remained relatively constant from 0 to 2 days post-farrowing for a majority of piglets. The prevalence of congenital tremors in pestivirus-inoculated litters ranged from 57% (4 out of 7 affected piglets) to 100% (10 out of 10 affected piglets). The virus was consistently detected by PCR in tissues from piglets with congenital tremors but was not detected in control piglets. Samples positive by PCR in greater than 90% of piglets sampled included brainstem (37 out of 41), mesenteric lymph node (37 out of 41), tracheobronchial lymph node (37 out of 41), and whole blood (19 out of 20). Although the first description of congenital tremors was in 1922, this is the first reported reproduction of congenital tremors following experimental inoculation with a divergent lineage porcine pestivirus. Studies investigating disease mechanism, epidemiology, and diagnostic assay development are needed to better understand the pathophysiology of congenital tremors due to this pestivirus.

J	Binder, S. C.; Telschow, A.; Meyer-Hermann, M.								Population dynamics of Borrelia burgdorferi in Lyme disease.								Frontiers in Microbiology				3	March			104	Article 104						2012	2012	Many chronic inflammatory diseases are known to be caused by persistent bacterial or viral infections. A well-studied example is the tick-borne infection by the gram-negative spirochaetes of the genus Borrelia in humans and other mammals, causing severe symptoms of chronic inflammation and subsequent tissue damage (Lyme Disease), particularly in large joints and the central nervous system, but also in the heart and other tissues of untreated patients. Although killed efficiently by human phagocytic cells in vitro, Borrelia exhibits a remarkably high infectivity in mice and men. In experimentally infected mice, the first immune response almost clears the infection. However, approximately 1 week post infection, the bacterial population recovers and reaches an even larger size before entering the chronic phase. We developed a mathematical model describing the bacterial growth and the immune response against Borrelia burgdorferi in the C3H mouse strain that has been established as an experimental model for Lyme disease. The peculiar dynamics of the infection exclude two possible mechanistic explanations for the regrowth of the almost cleared bacteria. Neither the hypothesis of bacterial dissemination to different tissues nor a limitation of phagocytic capacity were compatible with experiment. The mathematical model predicts that Borrelia recovers from the strong initial immune response by the regrowth of an immune-resistant sub-population of the bacteria. The chronic phase appears as an equilibration of bacterial growth and adaptive immunity. This result has major implications for the development of the chronic phase of Borrelia infections as well as on potential protective clinical interventions.																					CABI:20123368215

They are seasonal, appearing at the end of spring, and affect only about 15% of the animals. Conjunctival scrapings do not contain rickettsia or cellular inclusion bodies, the Weil-Felix test is negative, and there is no reaction to Q fever antigen. Chlortetracycline hastens recovery. Goats are unaffected. Healthy sheep developed conjunctivitis after conjunctival instillation of infected con-junctival scrapings treated with penicillin and streptomycin, but not if serum from recovered sheep was first placed in contact with the scrapings for 24 hours nor if the serum was instilled beneath the conjunctiva of the experimentally infected sheep. Mice, rabbits and chick embryos appeared to be insusceptible. The agent is considered to be a virus.-M.G.G.																					CABI:19602203577

We infected post-parturient AG129 murine dams deficient in type I and II interferon receptors with ZIKV. ZIKV RNA was detected in pup stomach milk clots (SMC) as early as 1 day post maternal infection (dpi) and persisted as late as 7 dpi. In mammary tissues, ZIKV replication was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in multiple cell types including cells morphologically consistent with myoepithelial cells. No mastitis was seen histopathologically. In the SMC and tissues of the nursing pups, no infectious virus was detected via focus forming assay. However, serial passages of fresh milk supernatant yielded infectious virus, and immunohistochemistry showed ZIKV replication protein associated with degraded cells in SMC. These results suggest that breast milk may contain infectious ZIKV. However, breast milk transmission (BMT) does not occur in this mouse strain that is highly sensitive to ZIKV infection. These results suggest a low risk for breast milk transmission of ZIKV, and provide a platform for investigating ZIKV entry into milk and mechanisms which may prevent or permit BMT.Author summary Can Zika virus be transmitted from nursing mothers to their children via breast milk? Only 4 years have passed since the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, and much remains to be understood about the transmission and health consequences of Zika infection. To date, some case reports have detected Zika virus RNA in the breast milk of infected mothers, but the presence of a virus' RNA does not mean that intact virus is present. Milk also contains many natural defense components against infection, so even intact virus carried in breast milk may not be infectious to a child. Here we used a mouse that is genetically engineered to be highly susceptible to Zika infection, and tested whether 1) we could find intact virus in mouse breast milk and 2) infection was passed from mother to pups. We found very low levels of intact Zika virus in mouse breast milk, and found none of the nursing pups to be infected. The model of Zika virus breast milk infection developed in this study establishes a system by which we may learn whether Zika RNA in human breast milk is truly infectious to children, and how Zika virus may enter the milk.

Role of mutational reversions and fitness restoration in Zika virus spread to the Americas								NATURE COMMUNICATIONS				12	1					595	10.1038/s41467-020-20747-3				JAN 26 2021	2021	Zika virus (ZIKV) emerged from obscurity in 2013 to spread from Asia to the South Pacific and the Americas, where millions of people were infected, accompanied by severe disease including microcephaly following congenital infections. Phylogenetic studies have shown that ZIKV evolved in Africa and later spread to Asia, and that the Asian lineage is responsible for the recent epidemics in the South Pacific and Americas. However, the reasons for the sudden emergence of ZIKV remain enigmatic. Here we report evolutionary analyses that revealed four mutations, which occurred just before ZIKV introduction to the Americas, represent direct reversions of previous mutations that accompanied earlier spread from Africa to Asia and early circulation there. Our experimental infections of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, human cells, and mice using ZIKV strains with and without these mutations demonstrate that the original mutations reduced fitness for urban, human-amplifed transmission, while the reversions restored fitness, increasing epidemic risk. These findings include characterization of three transmission-adaptive ZIKV mutations, and demonstration that these and one identified previously restored fitness for epidemic transmission soon before introduction into the Americas. The initial mutations may have followed founder effects and/or drift when the virus was introduced decades ago into Asia. The trajectory of the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) into the Americas remains unclear. Here, the authors find that four mutations originated before ZIKV introduction to the Americas are direct reversions of previous mutations that accompanied spread many decades ago from ZIKV's native Africa to Asia, and show in experimental infections of mosquitoes, human cells, and mice that the original mutations reduced fitness for urban transmission, while the reversions restored fitness, likely increasing epidemic risk.

Selective infection of CD4+ effector memory T lymphocytes leads to preferential depletion of memory T lymphocytes in R5 HIV-1-infected humanized NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgammanull mice.								Virology 				394	1			64	72		10.1016/j.virol.2009.08.011				2009	2009	To investigate the events leading to the depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes during long-term infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), we infected human CD34+ cells-transplanted NOD/SCID/IL-2Rgammanull mice with CXCR4-tropic and CCR5-tropic HIV-1. CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice were quickly depleted of CD4+ thymocytes and both CD45RA+ naive and CD45RA- memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, while CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice were preferentially depleted of CD45RA- memory CD4+ T lymphocytes. Staining of HIV-1 p24 antigen revealed that CCR5-tropic HIV-1 preferentially infected effector memory T lymphocytes (TEM) rather than central memory T lymphocytes. In addition, the majority of p24+ cells in CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice were activated and in cycling phase. Taken together, our findings indicate that productive infection mainly takes place in the activated TEM in cycling phase and further suggest that the predominant infection in TEM would lead to the depletion of memory CD4+ T lymphocytes in CCR5-tropic HIV-1-infected mice.

C57BL/6 mice were treated with synthetic peptides based upon different human TCR V beta CDR1 sequences following experimental infection with the murine retrovirus. Previous studies established that retrovirally infected mice produced autoantibodies to certain of these peptides, and their administration after infection diminished many of the cytokine abnormalities induced by the virus. This study determined whether the complete 16-mer synthetic peptides modeling the V beta CDR1/FR3 were required, and whether admixture of autoantigenic peptides synergized immune preservation. Treatment with complete TCR pep beta 3 and pep V beta 5.2 peptide alone and combined largely prevented the retrovirus-induced reduction in B and T cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine secretion while suppressing excessive production of Th2 cytokines, which are stimulated by retrovirus infection. Treatment with overlapping short peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 11-mer and C-terminal 12-mer did not significantly prevent the immune dysfunction in retrovirus-infected mice. These data suggest that immune dysfunction and abnormal cytokine production, induced by murine retrovirus infection, were largely prevented by TCR V beta CDR1 peptides, and the complete CDR1 in association with the five residues from FR2 was required.

Linkage analyses in F-2 progeny from MCMV-resistant MA/My (H2(k)) and MCMV-susceptible BALB/c (H2(d)) and BALB. K ( H2k) mouse strains indicated that only the combination of alleles encoded by a gene in the Klra ( also called Ly49) cluster on chromosome 6, and one in the major histocompatibility complex (H2) on chromosome 17, is associated with virus resistance. We found that natural killer cell - activating receptor Ly49P specifically recognized MCMV-infected cells, dependent on the presence of the H2k haplotype. This binding was blocked using antibodies to H-2D(k) but not antibodies to H-2K(k). These results are suggestive of a new natural killer cell mechanism implicated in MCMV resistance, which depends on the functional interaction of the Ly49P receptor and the major histocompatibility complex class I molecule H-2D(k) on MCMV-infected cells.

The CFT with bovine sera was performed with supplementation of the complement factors in fresh guinea pig serum by an adequate amount of Clq-factor of the bovine species. Kinetics of maternally derived antibodies and the antibody response after spontaneous and experimental infections and after i.m. vaccination were studied by both tests. Patterns of development of complement fixing and virus neutralizing antibodies were generally similar and titers equaled each other in the test systems that are described. However, after an infection, a VNT detected antibodies a few days earlier than a CFT and peak-levels reached after a naturally acquired infection decreased faster in a CFT than in a VNT; a mean decrease of 3.1 and 1.4 log2 U was found in 13 wk, respectively. Mean half-life of passive antibodies was 25 days in a VNT. An infection with bovine respiratory syncytial virus could be diagnosed by serology, using a CFT on acute and convalescent serum samples of a number of animals in a group. Serology is preferable to virus isolation for routine diagnosis of bovine respiratory syncytial virus infections. Paired sera, collected at 14 day intervals and examined by CFT, are recommended for the diagnosis of respiratory disease. A VNT is preferable if low antibody levels are to be detected because nonspecific reactions occur in a CFT at low serum dilutions.																					BCI:BCI198477067486		
J	Simos, J. Pedro; Swann, Debbie; Bowden, Rory; Efstathiou, Stacey								Analysis of murine gammaherpesvirus-68 transcription during lytic and latent infection								Journal of General Virology				80	1			75	82						Jan., 1999	1999	Murine gammaherpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) is a gamma2-herpesvirus that upon experimental infection of laboratory mice establishes a latent infection in B lymphocytes. To date, no virus-encoded gene products have been reported to be expressed during latent infection. In this study, viral transcription has been analysed in a persistently infected B-cell line and abundant and preferential transcription of open reading frame M3 has been identified. Significantly, in situ hybridization analysis of latently infected mouse spleens with probes corresponding to 20 MHV-68 ORFs demonstrated active transcription of a single ORF, corresponding to M3. The kinetics and pattern of transcription of M3 were compared with that of the virally encoded tRNAs (vtRNAs), previously demonstrated to constitute a marker for latent infection in the spleen. Transcription of vtRNAs in splenic tissue could be first detected at 7 days post-inoculation (p.i.) in scattered cells in periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths (PALS). At 10 days p.i., vtRNA transcription was widespread and localized not only to cells in PALS but also to cells within developing germinal centres and from 21 days p.i. expression was detected exclusively within lymphoid follicles. Transcription of vtRNAs could be detected as late as 70 days p.i. In contrast, the histological localization of M3 transcription, which was first detected at 7 days p.i. in scattered cells in PALS, never changed and transcription could not be detected beyond 21 days p.i. These results suggest that M3 is an ORF that is expressed early during the establishment of latency in vivo.																					BCI:BCI199900098452

Experimental Infection of Syrian Hamsters With Aerosolized Nipah Virus								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				218	10			1602	1610		10.1093/infdis/jiy357				NOV 15 2018	2018	Background. Nipah virus (NiV) is a paramyxovirus (genus Henipavirus) that can cause severe respiratory illness and encephalitis in humans. Transmission occurs through consumption of NiV-contaminated foods, and contact with NiV-infected animals or human body fluids. However, it is unclear whether aerosols derived from aforesaid sources or others also contribute to transmission, and current knowledge on NiV-induced pathogenicity after small-particle aerosol exposure is still limited.Methods. Infectivity, pathogenicity, and real-time dissemination of aerosolized NiV in Syrian hamsters was evaluated using NiV-Malaysia (NiV-M) and/or its recombinant expressing firefly luciferase (rNiV-Fluc(NP)).Results. Both viruses had an equivalent pathogenicity in hamsters, which developed respiratory and neurological symptoms of disease, similar to using intranasal route, with no direct correlations to the dose. We showed that virus replication was predominantly initiated in the lower respiratory tract and, although delayed, also intensely in the oronasal cavity and possibly the brain, with gradual increase of signal in these regions until at least day 5-6 postinfection.Conclusion. Hamsters infected with small-particle aerosolized NiV undergo similar clinical manifestations of the disease as previously described using liquid inoculum, and exhibit histopathological lesions consistent with NiV patient reports. NiV droplets could therefore play a role in transmission by close contact.																					WOS:000446875300010	29912426	
J	REMEZOV, P. I.								The influence of general X-radiation and cooling on the course of certain neurotropic virus infections in white mice								VOPR VIRUSOL [TRANSL]				4	(3)			58	61						1959	1959	General irradiation, even in comparatively small doses (300 r and less), reduces the resistance of mice to lymphocytic choriomeningitis and acute human disseminated encephalomyelitis viruses. The characteristics of the course of the virus infection in irradiated animals depend not only on the dose of irradiation, but also on the time elapsing from the moment of irradiation until infection. The greatest decrease of resistance (with all doses of irradiation) was noted in the 7th day after irradiation. The susceptibility of the animals to these viruses returned to normal approximately 3 months after irradiation. The course of experimental infection in white mice changes under the influence on the body of other factors as well (cold, fatigue, etc.). The clinical picture of these infections changes particularly sharply under the combined influence of several factors. In these conditions, even infection with a subinfective dose causes the development of severe disease. Thus, the course of a virus infection is frequently determined not only by the characteristics of the causative agent, but also by the state of reactivity of the macro-organism, depending on diverse factors in the external environment. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. concl																					BCI:BCI19603500063855

One of these, Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1 Gs/Gd)-like viruses, reassorted with other avian viruses to generate multiple genotypes of H5N1 viruses that crossed to chickens and other terrestrial poultry from its reservoir in geese. Whereas none of these recent reassortants had acquired the gene constellation of H5N1/97, these events provide insight into how such a virus may have been generated. The recent H5N1 reassortants readily infect and kill chicken and quail after experimental infection, and some were associated with significant mortality of chickens within the poultry retail markets in Hong Kong. Some genotypes are lethal for mice after intra-nasal inoculation and spread to the brain. On this occasion, the early detection of H5N1 viruses in the retail, live poultry markets led to preemptive intervention before the occurrence of human disease, but these newly emerging, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses provide cause for pandemic concern.

R	Kim, Eui Ho; Sullivan, Jeremy A; Suresh, M; Peng, Stanford L; Plisch, Erin H								FOXO3 Regulates CD8 T Cell Memory by T Cell-Intrinsic Mechanisms								Figshare															2016-01-14	2012	CD8 T cell responses have three phases: expansion, contraction, and memory. Dynamic alterations in proliferation and apoptotic rates control CD8 T cell numbers at each phase, which in turn dictate the magnitude of CD8 T cell memory. Identification of signaling pathways that control CD8 T cell memory is incomplete. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway controls cell growth in many cell types by modulating the activity of FOXO transcription factors. But the role of FOXOs in regulating CD8 T cell memory remains unknown. We show that phosphorylation of Akt, FOXO and mTOR in CD8 T cells occurs in a dynamic fashion in vivo during an acute viral infection. To elucidate the potentially dynamic role for FOXO3 in regulating homeostasis of activated CD8 T cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs, we infected global and T cell-specific FOXO3-deficient mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV). We found that FOXO3 deficiency induced a marked increase in the expansion of effector CD8 T cells, preferentially in the spleen, by T cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Mechanistically, the enhanced accumulation of proliferating CD8 T cells in FOXO3-deficient mice was not attributed to an augmented rate of cell division, but instead was linked to a reduction in cellular apoptosis. These data suggested that FOXO3 might inhibit accumulation of growth factor-deprived proliferating CD8 T cells by reducing their viability. By virtue of greater accumulation of memory precursor effector cells during expansion, the numbers of memory CD8 T cells were strikingly increased in the spleens of both global and T cell-specific FOXO3-deficient mice. The augmented CD8 T cell memory was durable, and FOXO3 deficiency did not perturb any of the qualitative attributes of memory T cells. In summary, we have identified FOXO3 as a critical regulator of CD8 T cell memory, and therapeutic modulation of FOXO3 might enhance vaccine-induced protective immunity against intracellular pathogens.

The 2 hormones behaved differently. The insulin values remained normal until the 12th hour of infection, with a statistically significant increase from the 12th hour up to their maximum peak at the 24th hour, remaining constant at that level until the 72nd hour. As for the glucagon values, there was a statistically significant decrease until the 24th hour of infection when they suddenly began to increase up to their maximum peak at the 48th hour remaining constant at that level until the 72nd hour. Increase of the insulin values may be attributed to liver cell damage because of the decreased metabolization of the hormone. Decreased glucagon values during the initial phase of the infection may be due to the concentration decrease of free plasma amino acids; increased values during the subsequent phases is probably caused by the concentration increase of free plasma amino acids, hypoglycemia and stress.

J	ANON.								Laboratory Diagnosis of Psittacosis.								Report. publ. Hlth med. Subj.					80			11 pp.	11 pp.						1937	1937	This report details laboratory technique for the detection of psittacosis in man, susceptible birds and mice. Stringent precautions in handling all infective materials are necessary and only specially equipped laboratories should undertake inoculation of suspect material.The following material from birds for diagnosis is collected in Griffith's tubes: -all lung tissue, any portion of liver showing focal necrosis and the spleen, also the pericardial fluid and heart blood. Smears on two or three slides are made from each of these and stained either by Giemsa's stain or a modification of the Castaneda stain. (Tissue sections are best stained by Heidenhain's iron-haematoxylin). If smears are negative for virus particles measuring 0.25, to l in diam. the organs are ground up, pooled and suspended in sterile broth or tap water and 0.5 c.c. injected (intraperit.) into at least two mice. If very contaminated with bacteria the suspension is centrifuged or filtered through sand and paper pulp and another group of mice is inoculated. The mice are observed for one month, one of each pair being killed at the 10th day and an emulsion of its spleen injected into a fresh pair. If all survive, apart from deaths from intercurrent disease, the test is negative, but a further passage of mouse spleen is advised. All survivors should be tested by inoculation of virulent material. If all die the negative result is confirmed. If any survive this indicates that the original inoculum contained a quantity of psittacosis virus sufficient to produce an active immunity, but not sufficient to cause fatal infection. Bacteriological examination of birds is a necessary procedure to eliminate other possible causes of suspicious lesions or death.Similar tissues and fluids, including any sputum and pleural fluid from suspected human cases are examined in the same way.In mice three main types of disease occur according to the survival time after infection and these are detailed.Ectromelia needs differentiation in mice, but the virus particles are acidophile whereas those of psittacosis are basophile.Infected budgerigars have been found in this country in a few instances. It is suggested that, if proof of such infection be obtained, as many birds as possible be examined to detect the percentage of " carriers ". This percentage is said to vary according to the age of the birds.The 12 figures illustrate the staining reactions of the virus particles. C. V. W.																					CABI:19382200438

Dynamic alterations in proliferation and apoptotic rates control CD8 T cell numbers at each phase, which in turn dictate the magnitude of CD8 T cell memory. Identification of signaling pathways that control CD8 T cell memory is incomplete. The PI3K/Akt signaling pathway controls cell growth in many cell types by modulating the activity of FOXO transcription factors. But the role of FOXOs in regulating CD8 T cell memory remains unknown. We show that phosphorylation of Akt, FOXO and mTOR in CD8 T cells occurs in a dynamic fashion in vivo during an acute viral infection. To elucidate the potentially dynamic role for FOXO3 in regulating homeostasis of activated CD8 T cells in lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs, we infected global and T cell-specific FOXO3-deficient mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV). We found that FOXO3 deficiency induced a marked increase in the expansion of effector CD8 T cells, preferentially in the spleen, by T cell-intrinsic mechanisms. Mechanistically, the enhanced accumulation of proliferating CD8 T cells in FOXO3-deficient mice was not attributed to an augmented rate of cell division, but instead was linked to a reduction in cellular apoptosis. These data suggested that FOXO3 might inhibit accumulation of growth factor-deprived proliferating CD8 T cells by reducing their viability. By virtue of greater accumulation of memory precursor effector cells during expansion, the numbers of memory CD8 T cells were strikingly increased in the spleens of both global and T cell-specific FOXO3-deficient mice. The augmented CD8 T cell memory was durable, and FOXO3 deficiency did not perturb any of the qualitative attributes of memory T cells. In summary, we have identified FOXO3 as a critical regulator of CD8 T cell memory, and therapeutic modulation of FOXO3 might enhance vaccine-induced protective immunity against intracellular pathogens.

We infected lung slices of house-dust mite (HDM)-sensitized asthmatic mice ex vivo with human rhinovirus (RV) and investigated the effect of the antiviral drug rupintrivir on RV-induced cytokine response in lung tissue of HDM-sensitized mice ex vivo. Methods Mice were sensitized with HDM. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from HDM-sensitized or non-sensitized mice. Lung slices were infected ex vivo with RV or RV together with rupintrivir. Modulation of immune responses was evaluated by cytokine secretion 48 h post infection. Results In vivo HDM sensitization resulted in a T-H-2/T-H-17-dominated cytokine response that persisted in PCLS ex vivo. RV infection of PCLS from non-sensitized mice resulted in the induction of an antiviral and pro-inflammatory immune response, as indicated by the secretion of IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-10, and IL-17A. In contrast, PCLS from HDM-sensitized mice showed an attenuated antiviral response, but exaggerated IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion upon infection. Rupintrivir inhibited exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and T-H-2 cytokine IL-4 in HDM-sensitized mice. Conclusions In summary, this study demonstrates that treatment with rupintrivir influences virus-induced IL-4 and IL-6 cytokine release under experimental conditions ex vivo.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				34	5			345	349						2012	2012	To study the variation of avian influenza virus (AIV), two AIVs (GD/362/09 and GD/244/10) of H6 subtype isolated from goose during the epidemiological survey were sequenced and analyzed. The sequencing results showed that both the isolates had the HA cleavage site of 339PQIETR GLFG348, which was a characteristic structure of low pathogenic AIV, and the nucleotide homology of HA and NA gene between GD/362/09 and GD/244/10 were 84.5% and 98.9%, the PA and M gene of GD/244/10 share the highest homology with that of A/Aquatic bird/Korea/w74/2005 (H5N2) and A/Duck/Hong Kong/140/1998 (H5N1), which indicated that it evolved from the same parent or reassortment had already occurred between the H6 and H5 subtype. Pathogenicity was examined by experimental infection of SPF chickens and BALB/c mice intranasally with 106 ErD50/100 L or 106 EID50/50 L, respectively. The results showed that both the H6 AIVs of goose origin failed to replicate in chickens, but they were able to replicate in mouse lung efficiently and only GD/244/10 was detected in mouse turbinate.

It is hypothesized that the brain disorders occur after recurrent reactivation of the latent infection in some kinds of cells in the brains. In order to test this hypothesis, we examined the reactivation of latent murine CMV (MCMV) infection in the mouse brain by transfer to brain slice culture. We infected neonatal and young adult mice intracerebrally with recombinant MCMV in which the lacZ gene was inserted into a late gene. The brains were removed 6 months after infection and used to prepare brain slices that were then cultured for up to 4 weeks. Reactivation of latent infection in the brains was detected by beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) staining to assess beta-galactosidase expression. Viral replication was also confirmed by the plaque assay. Reactivation was observed in about 75% of the mice infected during the neonatal period 6 months after infection. Unexpectedly, reactivation was also observed in 75% of mice infected as young adults, although the infection ratio in the brain slices was significantly lower than that in neonatally infected mice. beta-Gal-positive cells were observed in marginal regions of the brains or immature neural cells in the ventricular walls. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the beta-Gal-positive reactivated cells were neural stem or progenitor cells. These results suggest that brain disorders may occur long after infection by reactivation of latent infection in the immature neural cells in the brain.

Novel HLA-A2-restricted human metapneumovirus epitopes reduce viral titers in mice and are recognized by human T cells								VACCINE				34	24			2663	2670		10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.04.034				MAY 23 2016	2016	Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality from acute lower respiratory tract illness, with most individuals seropositive by age five. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, secondary infections are common and can be severe in young, elderly, and immunocompromised persons. Preclinical vaccine studies for HMPV have suggested a need for a balanced antibody and T cell immune response to enhance protection and avoid lung immunopathology. We infected transgenic mice expressing human HLA-A*0201 with HMPV and used ELISPOT to screen overlapping and predicted epitope peptides. We identified six novel HLA-A2 restricted CD8(+) T cell (T-CD8) epitopes, with M39-47 (M39) immunodominant. Tetramer staining detected M39-specific T-CD8 in lungs and spleen of HMPV-immune mice. Immunization with adjuvant-formulated M39 peptide reduced lung virus titers upon challenge. Finally, we show that T-CD8 from HLA-A*0201 positive humans recognize M39 by IFN gamma ELISPOT and tetramer staining. These results will facilitate HMPV vaccine development and human studies.

In 2 experiments, it was shown that there was no significant drop or progressive loss in titre up to 360 days of Langat virus (a tick-borne virus) in intact Ixodes ricinus or in suspensions of the infected ticks in 0.75% bovine albumin in borate saline buffered at pH 9, with or without added normal rabbit serum, when such material was stored at -70[degree] C. The virus titre in suspensions made in bovine albumin in saline remained remarkably constant, indicating that the addition of animal serum to the diluent was unnecessary for preserving the virus during subzero storage at -70[degree] C. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19664700018396	5827573

Two groups of mice, weighing 24 and 14 g, respectively, were subdivided into several groups of 14 to 20 mice and each given doses of thioctic acid ranging from 125 to 0.24 mg/kg per day. All concentrations of thioctic acid raised mouse mortality from 50 to 73% to 100%. The virus titers in the livers of the smaller mice, 3 days after inoculation, were 10-6.8 and 10-6.4 in treated and 10-5 in control groups. Transaminase activity, as determined by [mu]M oxaloacetate and pyruvate formed by 1 ml of serum was increased from 3.93 in normal animals, to 28.7 in infected animals and 46.4 and 51.0 in infected and treated mice. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Emilio Weiss																					BCI:BCI19573100035304

Antigens and cytokines influence the number of LC found in the epidermis. However, there has been no investigation into the effects of particular cytokines during resolution of a viral infection. In order to study this we infected mice subcutaneously with vaccinia virus (VV) constructs containing the genes encoding TNF-alpha, IL-6 or IFN-gamma and the density of LC, THY-1(+) dEC and CD4(+) cells was determined. In this system the cytokines were produced locally at the site of viral replication. Cell densities were examined at day 1, while the response was being initiated, and at day 5 as the infection was being resolved. Infection with VV, like exposure to other antigens, decreased the density of epidermal LC at day 1, and they remained depressed at day 5. Production of TNF-alpha during VV growth did not influence this response by LC, whereas IFN-gamma and IL-6 both increased the number of epidermal Ia(+) LC at day 1 but then caused a reduction at day 5. Thy-1(+) dEC were not affected by VV infection at any time-point examined, nor did any cytokine influence the density of these cells at day 1; However, by day 5 IFN-gamma and IL-6, but not TNF-alpha, decreased the number of Thy-1(+) dEC. These changes in cell densities are consistent with LC but not Thy-1(+) dEC playing a role in initiation of immunity against VV and a complex interplay between cytokines and these cells during the response to VV. CD4(+) T cells were also attracted into the epidermis by IFN-gamma and IL-6 but not by TNF-alpha.																					WOS:A1994PU53100004	7835982

In the present study, we report the isolation of HPAI H5N1 viruses (A/Md/Korea/W401/11 and A/Md/Korea/W404/11) from fecal samples of migratory birds. Genetic and phlyogenetic analyses demonstrated that these viruses are genetically identical possessing gene segments from avian virus origin and showing highest sequence similarities (as high as 99.8%) to A/Ws/Hokkaido/4/11 and 2009-2010 Mongolian-like clade 2.3.2 isolates rather than previous Korean H5N1 viruses. Both viruses possess the polybasic motif (QRERRRK/R) in HA but other genes did not bear additional virulence markers. Pathogenicity of A/Md/Korea/W401/11 was assessed and compared with a 2006 clade 2.2 HPAI H5N1 migratory bird isolate (A/EM/Korea/W149/06) in chickens, ducks, mice and ferrets. Experimental infection in these hosts showed that both viruses have high pathogenic potential in chickens (2.3-3.0 LD(50)s) and mice (3.3-3.9 LD(50)s), but A/Md/Korea/W401/11 was less pathogenic in duck and ferret models. Despite recovery of both infection viruses in the upper respiratory tract, efficient ferret-to-ferret transmission was not observed. These data suggest that the 2011 Korean HPAI wild bird H5N1 virus could replicate in mammalian hosts without pre-adaptation but could not sustain subsequent infection. This study highlights the role of migratory birds in the perpetuation and spread of HPAI H5N1 viruses in Far-East Asia. With the changing pathobiology caused by H5N1 viruses among wild and poultry birds, continued surveillance of influenza viruses among migratory bird species remains crucial for effective monitoring of high-pathogenicity or pandemic influenza viruses.

For the reverse transcriptional step, a specific Primer (R1 primer) and random (nonspecific) 9-mers primer were used. The specific 292 bp band could be defected clearly with the random primer, but not the specific primer from clinical and various autopsy samples of the pregnant mare and aborted fetus. The sensitivity to detect 7 strains of EAV by RT-PCR with the random primer was tested. The detection limit of Bibuna and Vienna strains of EAV was about 100 PFU, although that of other strains, Bucyrus, modified Bucyrus, 84KY-A1, Red Mile and Wroclaw ranged from 1 to 10 PFU. By our RT-PCR method, EAV could be detected within 1 day and could be obtained directly from a urine sample, from which the virus was difficult to isolate without pretreatment due to toxicity in cell culture.

Over the duration of the pandemic, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S) have arisen in circulating viral populations, culminating in the spread of several variants of concern (VOC) with varying degrees of altered virulence, transmissibility, and neutralizing antibody escape. In this study, we employed lentivirus-based pseudotyped viruses that express specific SARS-CoV-2 S protein substitutions and cell lines that stably express ACE2 from nine different animal species to gain insights into the effects of VOC mutations on viral entry and antibody neutralization capability. All animal ACE2 receptors tested, except mink, support viral cell entry for pseudoviruses expressing the parental (prototype Wuhan-1) S at levels comparable to human ACE2. Most single S substitutions (e.g., 452R, 478K, 501Y) did not significantly change virus entry, although 614G and 484K resulted in a decreased efficiency in viral entry. Conversely, combinatorial VOC substitutions in the S protein were associated with significantly increased entry capacity of pseudotyped viruses compared to that of the parental Wuhan-1 pseudotyped virus. Similarly, infection studies using live ancestral (USA-WA1/2020), Alpha, and Beta SARS-CoV-2 viruses in hamsters revealed a higher replication potential for the Beta variant compared to the ancestral prototype virus. Moreover, neutralizing titers in sera from various animal species, including humans, were significantly reduced by single substitutions of 484K or 452R, double substitutions of 501Y-484K, 452R-484K and 452R-478K and the triple substitution of 501Y-484K-417N, suggesting that 484K and 452R are particularly important for evading neutralizing antibodies in human, cat, and rabbit sera. Cumulatively, this study reveals important insights into the host range of SARS-CoV-2 and the effect of recently emergent S protein substitutions on viral entry, virus replication and antibody-mediated viral neutralization.Author summary: Cells stably expressing ACE2 from various animals and a lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus assay were established to study SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. The results demonstrated that ACE2 from a wide range of animal species facilitate S-mediated virus entry into cells, which is supported by in silico data as well as natural and experimental infection studies. Pseudotyped viruses containing mutations in the RBD of S representative of the Alpha, Gamma, and especially Beta, variants of concern demonstrated that certain mutations are associated with increased viral entry compared to the parental S. The Beta variant was also observed to have a replicative advantage in vitro and in vivo compared to the prototype virus. Pseudotyped viruses containing combinatorial substitutions of 501Y-484K-417K, 614G-501Y-484K and 614G-501Y-484K-417N increased viral entry via ACE2 across multiple species. The 501Y or 478K single substitution did not significantly affect neutralizing capacity of immune sera compared to the prototype strain, but the addition of 484K or 452R substitutions significantly reduced the neutralizing titers.

Sequences of all gene segments of one isolate from 2013 (A/turkey/Poland/14/2013(H9N2)) and two isolates from 2014 (A/turkey/Poland/08/2014(H9N2), A/turkey/Poland/09/2014(H9N2)) were obtained and analyzed in search of the phylogenetic relationship and molecular markers of zoonotic potential or increased pathogenicity. All gene segments were shown to originate from the wild bird reservoir and the close relationship of the analyzed isolates proved the link between the outbreaks in 2013 and 2014. However, remarkable molecular differences between isolates from 2013 to 2014 were identified, including mutation in the HA cleavage site (CS) leading to conversion from the PAASNR*GLF to the PAASKR*GLF motif and truncation of the PB1-F2 protein. Additionally, T97I substitution in the PA protein in A/turkey/Poland/08/2014 was detected which can be responsible for enhanced activity of viral polymerase in mammalian cells. However, experimental infection of mice with both isolates from 2014 showed their low pathogenicity, and no statistically significant differences in virus replication were observed between the viruses. Nevertheless, these findings indicate the dynamic evolution of H9N2 in the field emphasizing the need for monitoring of the situation in terms of H9N2 AI in Europe.

Oppositely directed influence of MIF and phosprenyl (PP) upon the course of experimental viral infection in mice				Разнонаправленное действие MIF и фоспренила на течение экспериментальной вирусной инфекции				Veterinariya i kormlenie	Ветеринария и кормление				3			97	98						2017	2017	To study influence of intracerebrally (i.c) inoculated MIF upon the course of experimental tick-borne virus infection in mice, as well as influence of PP and/or anti-MIF antibodies upon the course of the infection concomitant with MIF inoculation. Materials and methods. Commercially available Phosprenyl was used. It was inoculated i.c.. Recombinant human MIF (R&D, USA) was used throughout. Results. Stimulation of MIF production was seen in blood sera of mice infected by TBEV from day 8 till day10 following infection - when clinical symptoms of tick-borne encephalitis were developed. On the contrary, PP inoculation to infected mice resulted in inhibition of MIF production in the same period. I.c inoculation of MIF at a greater dose to infected mice led to significant rise in lethality (by 40%), while mean life span index was decreased by 2.3 days. So, MIF at high doses caused aggravation of the course of TBEV-induced infection in mice. On the contrary, inoculation of PP at a dose of 60 mcg to TBEVinfected mice, resulted in 100% survival. Similarly, i.c. inoculation of anti-MIF antibodies to TBEV-infected mice led to significant decrease in lethality (down to 26% compared with controls), while mean life span index was up by 5.5 days. Simultaneous i.c. inoculation of MIF, PP anti-MIF antibodies to the infected mice also prevented MIF-induced aggravation of the infection course. Thus, Phosprenyl may be considered as a promising contraregulatory agent in respect to MIF.

При введении MIF в дозе 20 нг мышам, инфицированным ВКЭ, летальность значительно (на 40%) увеличилась, а СПЖ, напротив, сократилась на 2,3 сут. Таким образом, MIF в высоких дозах вызывал утяжеление инфекции, вызванной ВКЭ у мышей. Напротив, введение заражённым мышам ФП в дозе 60 мкг приводило к защите от инфекции, вызванной ВКЭ, в 100%. Аналогичным образом, и/ц введение АТ к MIF заражённым ВКЭ мышам приводило к существенному снижению показателя летальности - до 26% по сравнению с контролем, и увеличению СПЖ на 5,5 суток. При одновременном введении в мозг заражённых мышей MIF, ФП и АТ к MIF регистрировалось предотвращение MIF-индуцированного утяжеления тяжести течения КЭ. Таким образом, Фоспренил можно рассматривать в качестве перспективного средства контррегуляции MIF.																		RSCI:29449269

B. microti antigens were harvested from experimentally infected hamster blood and used as a coating antigen. The sensitivity and specificity of the IgG ELISA relative to immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) testing was 95.5% and 94.1%, respectively. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve was 0.987. No cross-reactivity of serum samples collected from patients infected with Toxoplasma gondii, Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Bartonella quintana, Dengue virus, or West Nile virus was detected. Cross-reactivity was observed with one of 35 sera from patients infected with Bartonella henselae. These results indicate that the established ELISA methods could be utilized as an accurate measure for the clinical diagnosis of human babesiosis.																					WOS:000225266800001	15696612

The drug has been shown to protect mice against experimental infection with a lethal dose of West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for outbreaks of meningitis and encephalitis for which no antiviral therapy has been licensed; however, the mechanism of action of the drug is still not well understood. Here, we describe the potent in vitro antiviral activity of favipiravir against WNV, showing that it decreases virus-specific infectivity and drives the virus to extinction. Two passages of WNV in the presence of 1 mM favipiravir-a concentration that is more than 10-fold lower than its 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50)-resulted in a significant increase in mutation frequency in the mutant spectrum and in a bias toward A -> G and G -> A transitions relative to the population passaged in the absence of the drug. These data, together with the fact that the drug is already licensed in Japan against influenza virus and in a clinical trial against Ebola virus, point to favipiravir as a promising antiviral agent to fight medically relevant flaviviral infections, such as that caused by WNV.

Trudy Vsesoyuznogo Instituta Eksperimental'noi Veterinarii				33				76	90						1967	1967	Mice, rats, g.pigs and rabbits were not susceptible to the experimental infection. However, goats aged 3-5 months responded to i/p infection with fever, diarrhoea and loss of condition. Microscopic lesions found in one goat that died were similar to those observed in pigs. Pigs of different ages immunized with crystal violet vaccine and others not immunized succumbed to the infection. The virus survived a 3-hour exposure to sunlight, more than 9 months in decomposed tissue and more than 6 years in blood. Oral infection was ineffective unless the pigs had previously had a gastric condition or had wounds on the mucous membrane. It was established that the transmission is aerogenic, conjunctival and intranasal. While in ordinary swine fever anorexia and general symptoms occurred at the onset of the infection, in African swine fever these symptoms preceded death by some 24-28 hours. African swine fever was characterized by necrosis of lymphocytes and reticulo-endothelial cells, haemorrhagic and enlarged spleen and visceral lymph nodes, oedema of the interlobar and interlobular pulmonary connective tissue and by haemorrhagic gastritis. The virus remained virulent for the pig after 19 goat and 30 tissue culture passages.Although Rhipicephalus bursa and Haematopinus suis collected from infected animals harboured the virus there was no transovarial transmission. It was therefore concluded that these parasites were not important as reservoirs and vectors of the infection.KJB.																					CABI:19682203127

Its prevalence has increased in developing countries in spite of the availability of valuable antiviral drug therapy. Considering the importance of HSV-2 infections, effective vaccines remain the most likely hope for controlling the spread of HSV diseases. In the present study, the complete HSV-2 glycoprotein D gene was isolated and cloned into different plasmid vectors to construct a DNA vaccine and prepare recombinant subunit vaccines using a baculovirus expression system. The vaccines were tested alone or in combination to evaluate their ability to induce protective immunity in guinea-pigs against genital HSV infections. Immunization elicited humoral responses as measured by neutralization tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunized animals had less severe genital skin disease as well as reduced replication of the challenging virus in the genital tract during experimental infection. Our results further demonstrate that DNA priming-protein boosting induced a neutralizing antibody titer higher than that obtained with DNA-DNA vaccination. The massive increase of antibody titer following DNA priming-protein boosting might be attributed to a recall of B cell memory.																					WOS:000259025100002	18647350

Both embryos developed into expanded blastocyst stage after 48 hr of culture. Zona-intact embryos were resistant to infection and subsequent transfer resulted in the development of fetuses, indicating that the zona pellucida plays a role of a barrier to virus infection. On the other hand, zona-free embryos were susceptible to infection and only one fetus out of 64 transfers developed to term. Implantation sites were scarcely observed in the uteri of the foster mothers that received zona-free embryos, suggesting that most of the embryos did not develop after embryo transfer. Sendai virus was shed in the culture fluid of the zona-free embryos indicating viral replication in the embryonic cells. By immunofluorescence assay, viral antigens were detected in the embryos, tissues of the fetus and implantation site derived from the zona-free embryos. These findings indicate that replication of Sendai virus in the embryonic cells interfere with early embryonic development and fetal growth of the embryo. infection, mouse embryo, Sendai virus.

Interestingly, this function is restricted to a minor fraction of pDC (Zucchini et al. Int. Immunol. 2008). In this project, we aimed at identifying the molecular pathways involved in inducing IFn-I/III production in this minor faction of pDC during in vivo infection by the mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV). To achive this goal, we infected with MCMV Ifnb1Eyfp mice, in which IFn-producing pDC can be detected by YFP expression (Scheu et al. PnAS 2008). Thanks to this model, we were able to sort three distinct subsets of pDC: CD86-YFP- (not activated, non IFn-producing), CD86+YFP- (activated, non IFn-producing) and CD86+YFP+ (activated, IFn-producing) and to perform microarray analysis. This allowed us to select genes differentially expressed among these three subsets and to mine these data in order to identify the related signaling pathways.

Memory T Cells Are Enriched in Lymph Nodes of Selectin-Ligand-Deficient Mice								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				185	10			5751	5761		10.4049/jimmunol.1001878				NOV 15 2010	2010	Fucosyltransferase-IV and -VII double knockout (FtDKO) mice reveal profound impairment in T cell trafficking to lymph nodes (LNs) due to an inability to synthesize selectin ligands. We observed an increase in the proportion of memory/effector (CD44(high)) T cells in LNs of FtDKO mice. We infected FtDKO mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus to generate and track Ag-specific CD44(high) CD8 T cells in secondary lymphoid organs. Although frequencies were similar, total Ag-specific effector CD44(high) CD8 T cells were significantly reduced in LNs, but not blood, of FtDKO mice at day 8. In contrast, frequencies of Ag-specific memory CD44(high) CD8 T cells were up to 8-fold higher in LNs of FtDKO mice at day 60. Because wild-type mice treated with anti-CD62L treatment also showed increased frequencies of CD44(high) T cells in LNs, we hypothesized that memory T cells were preferentially retained in, or preferentially migrated to, FtDKO LNs. We analyzed T cell entry and egress in LNs using adoptive transfer of bone fide naive or memory T cells. Memory T cells were not retained longer in LNs compared with naive T cells; however, T cell exit slowed significantly as T cell numbers declined. Memory T cells were profoundly impaired in entering LNs of FtDKO mice; however, memory T cells exhibited greater homeostatic proliferation in FtDKO mice. These results suggest that memory T cells are enriched in LNs with T cell deficits by several mechanisms, including longer T cell retention and increased homeostatic proliferation.

To evaluate the effects of infection on mitochondrial disease we used a mouse model of Leigh Syndrome, where a missense mutation in the Taco1 gene results in the loss of the translation activator of cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (TACO1) protein. The mutation leads to an isolated complex IV deficiency that mimics the disease pathology observed in human patients with TACO1 mutations. We infected Taco1 mutant and wild-type mice with a murine cytomegalovirus and show that a common viral infection exacerbates the complex IV deficiency in a tissue-specific manner. We identified changes in neuromuscular morphology and tissue-specific regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway in response to viral infection. Taken together, we report for the first time that a common stress condition, such as viral infection, can exacerbate mitochondrial dysfunction in a genetic model of mitochondrial disease.Author summaryMitochondrial diseases are the most commonly inherited metabolic disorders that are heterogenic and have varied disease onset and progression. Acquired infections and the associated inflammatory responses are known triggers for mitochondrial disease in the clinic and can cause progressive deterioration in patients with mitochondrial disease. Knowledge of how an infection causes and contributes to the progression of mitochondrial disease is completely lacking and has never before been investigated. Here we examined the effects of a viral infection in a model of energy dysfunction and identified that cytomegalovirus can worsen the progression of mitochondrial disease symptoms.

Mendeley Data											http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/88SWS374ZH.1				2020-08-04	2019	Cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells found in animals as in humans, and symptoms are often similar to those in people. Recently, many bacterial, viral, and helminth infections are considered major causes of cancer. The current study aims to discuss whether Trypanosoma evansi causes cancer or behaves like a cancerous cell, and to assess the potential effects of sex on the measured parameters. Advanced tumor biomarkers and accompanied clinicopathological criteria used to discover the carcinogenic effects and progression of T. evansi in experimentally infected Albino Wistar rats. Results revealed that death appears highly correlated with the length of fulmination of parasitemia. Clinicopathological changes were associated with significant differences (P<0.05) increases in antitrypanosomal IgM, IgG, and CEA in the infected rats. Whereas, the levels of malignant and tumor biomarkers such as IL-2, alpha-TNT, B2-M, AFP increased with highly significant differences (P<.0001). In contrast, CRP, CA-125, and CA-15.3 levels increased with no significant differences (P>0.05) in females. Similarly, CRP, serum PSA, and CA-19.9 levels elevated in infected males by the end of the experiment. Blood picture analysis showed leucopenia and anemia rose significantly more in males than females. Biochemical analysis showed hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, hypolipidemia, and fluctuations in enzymes followed by experimental infections in both infected groups. Despite the examined tissues not severely changeable by the infection along with the short time of the experiment, the uncontrolled parasitemia load in T. evansi leads to further adverse pathogenesis to the host, causing cell and tissue destruction as generated by invasive cancer cells. Sex was a risk factor following a T. evansi infection. We concluded that the studied parameters confirmed that T. evansi could behave like cancer and possibly carcinogenic to rats. The correlation between all studied parameters evidenced that T. evansi probably causes leukemia and hepatocarcinoma, and the spread of infection coincides with the nature of cancer. Keywords: Cancer; Trypanosoma evansi; Tumor markers; Clinicopathological; Rats. Conclusion The current study measured the levels of tumor markers in the serum of rats experimentally infected with T. evansi and correlates these levels with hematological and pathophysiological parameters. It could be considered T. evansi as a typical cancer, however, the subsequent uncontrolled growth was seen and rats died in a few days by T. evansi on contrary to T. brucei previously studied pointed to it maybe the cancerous form of T. brucei. The correlation between all studied parameters evidenced that T. evansi probably causes leukemia and hepatocarcinoma, and the spread of infection from organs to others coincides with the nature of cancer.

B	Ozbun, Michelle A.; Kivitz, Michael P.						Gaston, K		The Art and Science of Obtaining Virion Stocks for Experimental Human Papillomavirus Infections								SMALL DNA TUMOUR VIRUSES								19	35						2012	2012	Some human papillomaviruses (HPVs) have been propagated in the laboratory for approximate to 20 years; currently, there are multiple means for obtaining infectious virion stocks for experimental infections. Processes dependent upon epithelial differentiation for achieving virion production include natural warts, rodent xenografts, and cultured organotypic epithelial tissues. However, these options are not amenable for every HPV genotype, and virion yields are variable and viral genotype-dependent. Differentiation-dependent laboratory approaches are limited to virus production from replication-competent viral genomes and typically only viral genomes capable of conferring a significant cellular growth advantage can be maintained long-term. Cutaneous HPV and animal PV lesions yield the highest virion levels and pure stocks can be obtained for many cutaneous PVs. Only crude, low-purity virion stocks have been reported for carcinogenic HPVs (e.g. types 16, 18, 31) typically via organotypic tissue propagation. Advances in virion production methods independent of epithelial differentiation permit the isolation of high-titre, high-purity viral stocks from virtually any cloned PV genotype. Based on the self assembly of transiently expressed capsid proteins to package DNA molecules of approximate to 5 to 8 kb in size, this approach provides the ability to produce infectious particles encapsidating any viral or reporter genome regardless of its replicative ability. These particles share many structural and functional similarities with differentiation-induced virions; however, questions remain about the absolute physiological likeness among PV stocks derived by different means. Herein we discuss advantages and disadvantages among the varied means of virion production, detail known similarities, and make note of potential disparities that have yet to be tested.

These tumors display little evidence of loss of heterozygosity, and MMLV is only weakly synergistic with the Trp53 null genotype, suggesting that viral lymphomagenesis involves mechanisms which do not require mutational loss of Trp53 function. To explore this relationship in greater depth, we infected CD2-myc transgenic mice with MMLV and examined the role of Trp53 in the genesis of these tumors. Most (19 of 27) of the tumors from MMLV-infected, CD2-myc Trp53(+/-) mice retained the wild-type Trp53 allele in vivo while tumors of uninfected CD2-myc Trp53(+/-) mice invariably showed allele loss from a significant fraction of primary tumor cells. The functional integrity of the Trp53 gene in these tumors was indicated by ongoing allele loss or selection for mutational stabilization during in vitro propagation and by the radiosensitivity of selected Trp53(+/-) tumor cell lines. An inverse correlation was noted between retention of the wild-type Trp53 allele and expression of p19(ARF), providing further evidence of negative-feedback control of the latter by p53. However, expression of p19(ARF) does not appear to be counterselected in the absence of p53, and its integrity in Trp53(+/-) tumors was indicated by its transcriptional upregulation on Trp53 wild-type allele loss in vitro in selected tumor cell lines. The role of MMLV was investigated further by analysis of proviral insertion sites in tumors of CD2-myc transgenic mice sorted for Trp53 genotype. A proportion of tumors showed insertions at Runx2, an oncogene which has been shown to collaborate independently with CD2-myc and with the Trp53 null genotype, and at a novel common integration site (ptl-1) on chromosome 8. Genotypic analysis of the panel of tumors suggested that neither of these integrations is functionally redundant with loss of p53, but it appears that the combination of the MMLV oncogenic program with the CD2-myc oncogene relegates p53 loss to a late step in tumor progression or in vitro culture. While the means by which these tumors preempt the p53 tumor suppressor response remains to be established, this study provides further evidence that irreversible inactivation of this pathway is not a prerequisite for tumor development in vivo.

Voprosy virusologii				66	6			442	451		10.36233/0507-4088-63				2022 Jan 08	2022	INTRODUCTION: Verification of histological changes in respiratory system using Syrian (golden) hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) as experimental model is an important task for preclinical studies of drugs intended for prevention and treatment of the novel coronavirus infection COVID-19.The aim of this work was to study pathological changes of pulmonary tissue in SARS-CoV-2 (Coronaviridae: Coronavirinae: Betacoronavirus; Sarbecovirus) experimental infection in Syrian hamsters.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Male Syrian hamsters weighting 80-100 g were infected by intranasal administration of culture SARS-CoV-2 at dose 4 * 104 TCID50/ml (TCID is tissue culture infectious dose). Animals were euthanatized on 3, 7 and 14 days after infection, with gravimetric registration. The viral load in lungs was measured using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Right lung and trachea tissues were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and according to Mallory.RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The highest viral replicative activity in lungs was determined 3 days after the infection. After 7 days, on a background of the decrease of the viral load in lungs, a pathologically significant increase of the organ's gravimetric parameters was observed. Within 3 to 14 days post-infection, the lung histologic pattern had been showing the development of inflammation with a succession of infiltrative-proliferative, edematousmacrophagal and fibroblastic changes. It was found that initial changes in respiratory epithelium can proceed without paranecrotic interstitial inflammation, while in the formation of multiple lung parenchyma lesions, damage to the epithelium of bronchioles and acinar ducts can be secondary. The appearance of epithelioid large-cell metaplastic epithelium, forming pseudoacinar structures, was noted as a pathomorphological feature specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection in Syrian hamsters.CONCLUSION: As a result of the study, the specific features of the pathology of the respiratory system in SARSCoV-2 infected Syrian hamsters were described. These findings are of practical importance as reference data that can be used for preclinical studies to assess the effectiveness of vaccines and potential drugs.

In this study, reverse genetics was used to generate and characterize recombinant influenza A (H1N1) viruses harboring L26F, V27A, A30T, S31N, G34E, and V27A/S31N mutations in the M2 gene. In plaque reduction assays, all mutations conferred amantadine resistance, with drug concentrations resulting in reduction of plaque number by 50% (IC(50)s) 154- to 3,300-fold higher than those seen for the wild type (WT). M2 mutants had no impairment in their replicative capacities in vitro on the basis of plaque size and replication kinetics experiments. In addition, all mutants were at least as virulent as the WT in experimentally infected mice, with the highest mortality rate being obtained with the recombinant harboring a double V27A/S31N mutation. These findings could help explain the frequent emergence and transmission of amantadine-resistant influenza viruses during antiviral pressure in the clinical setting.

Epidemiological data from the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic and recent Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak indicate that there may be sex-dependent differences in disease outcomes. To investigate these differences, we infected male and female mice of different age groups with SARS-CoV and analyzed their susceptibility to the infection. Our results showed that male mice were more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection compared with age-matched females. The degree of sex bias to SARS-CoV infection increased with advancing age, such that middle-aged mice showed much more pronounced differences compared with young mice. Enhanced susceptibility of male mice to SARS-CoV was associated with elevated virus titers, enhanced vascular leakage, and alveolar edema. These changes were accompanied by increased accumulation of inflammatory monocyte macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs of male mice, and depletion of inflammatory monocyte macrophages partially protected these mice from lethal SARS. Moreover, the sex-specific differences were independent of T and B cell responses. Furthermore, ovariectomy or treating female mice with an estrogen receptor antagonist increased mortality, indicating a protective effect for estrogen receptor signaling in mice infected with SARS-CoV. Together, these data suggest that sex differences in the susceptibility to SARS-CoV in mice parallel those observed in patients and also identify estrogen receptor signaling as critical for protection in females.

We infected Cdkn2a(-/-) mice with Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) to screen for loci that can participate in tumorigenesis in collaboration with loss of the Cdkn2a-encoded tumor suppressors p16INK4a and p19ARF. Insertional mutagenesis by the latent retrovirus was synergistic with loss of Cdkn2a expression, as indicated by a marked acceleration in the development of both myeloid and lymphoid tumors. We isolated 747 unique sequences flanking retroviral integration sites and mapped them against the mouse genome sequence databases from Celera and Ensembl. In addition to 17 insertions targeting gene loci known to be cancer-related, we identified a total of 37 new common insertion sites (CISs), of which 8 encode components of signaling pathways that are involved in cancer. The effectiveness of large-scale insertional mutagenesis in a sensitized genetic background is demonstrated by the preference for activation of MAP kinase signaling, collaborating with Cdkn2a loss in generating the lymphoid and myeloid tumors. Collectively, our results show that large-scale retroviral insertional mutagenesis in genetically predisposed mice is useful both as a system for identifying genes underlying cancer and as a genetic framework for the assignment of such genes to specific oncogenic pathways.

To develop an animal model of this disease, strain 13 and Hartley strain guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously with Guananto strain 95551 of arenavirus in a pilot study to determine susceptibility of the species to the virus. All animals were killed when moribund 12-14 days following inoculation. Animals were necropsied and tissues were fixed and examined by both light and electron microscopy. Viral antigen was demonstrated in the tissues by immunohistochemistry at both the light and electron microscopic levels. Lesions were characterized by single cell necrosis of epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, interstitial pneumonia, lymphoid and hematopoietic cell necrosis, and the presence of platelet thrombi in occasional blood vessels associated with hemorrhage. Viral antigen was demonstrated in lymphoid tissues and macrophages, endothelial cells of multiple organs, pulmonary epithelium epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, and in miscellaneous other tissues and cells. Intact virions and typical arenavirus inclusions were demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy in these tissues. Based on these findings, the guinea pig appears to be a valid animal model of the human disease.																					WOS:A1996VA96300014	8702027

Such hairless patches disappeared after 4 or 5 days. If older mice were inoculated, the alopecia was progressively less as the age of the mice increased at the time of their inoculation. 44 mice survived the tests and 43 of these showed HI antibodies specific for o'nyong-nyong virus. 41 of the 43 had shown the alopecia. Two other Group A viruses and one as-yet-ungrouped strain will also produce the patchy type of hairlessness in infant mice. It may be possible to use the appearance of such symptoms as a criterion of the success or failure of the passing of such viruses through the mouse host. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A. C.

Because protection from experimental infection by papillomavirus is mediated by neutralizing IgG, we sought the mechanisms that trigger humoral immunity to HPV16 L1 VLP. We find that HPV16 L1 VLP bind to murine B lymphocytes thereby inducing activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression and Ig class switch recombination to cause the generation of IgG. HPV16 L1 VLP also activate production of proinflammatory factors IFN-alpha, IL-6, MIP-1 alpha, RANTES, and KC, up-regulate the expression of costimulatory molecules by naive B cells, and increase the B1 B cell subpopulation. These B cell responses to HPV16 L1 VLP are dependent upon MyD88. Although MyD88(-/-) B cells produce only fit transcript after exposure to HPV16 L1 VLP, MyD88(+/+) B cells express a, gamma, and mu Ig H chain and activation-induced cytidine deaminase transcripts. Notably, TLR4 mutant C3H/Hej mice exhibited significantly reduced HPV16 VLP-specific IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 titers after vaccination as compared with the control C3H/HeOuJ mice. HPV16 L1 VLP directly activated class switch recombination and costimulatory molecule expression by B cells of C3H/HeOuJ mice but not C3H/HeJ mice. Thus HPV16 L1 VLP directly activate B cells to induce CD4(+) T cell independent humoral immune responses via TLR4- and MyD88-dependent signaling.																					WOS:000229791400055	15944297

It was established that rimantadine treatment led to a decrease of the products of lipid peroxidation in tissues of mice experimentally infected with influenza virus A/Aichi/2/68(H3N2). The effect is strongest in blood plasma (a decrease of about 50%) and weaker in the lung (about 20%). To elucidate the mechanism of this action of rimantadine, experiments were carried out with some model systems. The capability of rimantadine to scavenge superoxide radicals (scavenging properties) was studied in a system of xanthine-xanthine oxidase to generate superoxide. The amount of superoxide was measured spectrophotometrically by the NBT-test and chemiluminesce. Rimantadine does not show scavenging properties and its antioxidant effect observed in vivo, is not a result of its direct action on the processes of lipid peroxidation and/or interaction with antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant properties of rimantadine were investigated by measurement of induced lipid peroxidation in a Fe2+ and (Fe2+ - EDTA) system with an egg liposomal suspension. Our findings with model systems do not prove an antioxidant or prooxidant effect of the drug on the processes of lipid peroxidation. Apparently the observed antioxidant effect of rimantadine in vivo is not connected directly with free radical processes in the organism.																					WOS:000165242800025	11098838

Chemokine Binding Protein M3 of Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 Modulates the Host Response to Infection in a Natural Host								PLOS PATHOGENS				7	3					e1001321	10.1371/journal.ppat.1001321				MAR 2011	2011	Murine gamma-herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) infection of Mus musculus-derived strains of mice is an attractive model of gamma-herpesvirus infection. Surprisingly, however, ablation of expression of MHV-68 M3, a secreted protein with broad chemokine-binding properties in vitro, has no discernable effect during experimental infection via the respiratory tract. Here we demonstrate that M3 indeed contributes significantly to MHV-68 infection, but only in the context of a natural host, the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Specifically, M3 was essential for two features unique to the wood mouse: virus-dependent inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung and highly organized secondary follicles in the spleen, both predominant sites of latency in these organs. Consequently, lack of M3 resulted in substantially reduced latency in the spleen and lung. In the absence of M3, splenic germinal centers appeared as previously described for MHV-68-infected laboratory strains of mice, further evidence that M3 is not fully functional in the established model host. Finally, analyses of M3's influence on chemokine and cytokine levels within the lungs of infected wood mice were consistent with the known chemokine-binding profile of M3, and revealed additional influences that provide further insight into its role in MHV-68 biology.

Both experimental infection schedules were able to induce a "positive" CMI response. NK cell activity was also significantly stimulated, especially by the administration of high virus amounts/inoculum, with frequent injections. On the contrary, LPS-dependent IL-1 synthesis increased particularly following application of the other experimental schedule (low virus amounts, few injections). Some aspects concerning CMI, NK and IL-1 relationships, during several enteroviral diseases, are discussed.																					BCI:BCI199192029187	2171627

Outbreaks with many fatalities have occurred sporadically in the Asia-Pacific region and have become a serious public health concern. It is hypothesized that virulent mutations in the EV-A71 genome cause these occasional outbreaks. Analysis of EV-A71 neurovirulence determinants is important, but there are no virulence determinants that are widely accepted among researchers. This is because most studies have been done in artificially infected mouse models and because EV-A71 mutates very quickly to adapt to the artificial host environment. Although EV-A71 uses multiple receptors for infection, it is clear that adaptation-related mutations alter the binding specificity of the receptors and allow the virus to adopt the best entry route for each environment. Such mutations have confused interpretations of virulence in animal models. This article will discuss how environment-adapted mutations in EV-A71 occur, how they affect virulence, and how such mutations can be avoided. We also discuss future perspectives for EV-A71 virulence research.																					WOS:000689814200001	34452525

J	Olive, Marie-Marie; Goodman, Steven M.; Reynes, Jean-Marc								THE ROLE OF WILD MAMMALS IN THE MAINTENANCE OF RIFT VALLEY FEVER VIRUS								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				48	2			241	266		10.7589/0090-3558-48.2.241				APR 2012	2012	Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus affecting primarily domestic ruminants and humans. Numerous vector species are known or implicated in the transmission of RVFV. The role of mammals in the maintenance of RVFV, and the existence of a wild mammal reservoir in the epidemiologic cycle of RVFV, remain largely unknown. Our objective is to present a detailed review of studies undertaken on RVFV, often associated with wild mammals, with the aim of focusing future research on potential reservoirs of the virus. Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of wild ruminants, especially African buffalo (Syncerus Gaffer), is also discussed. Conflicting results have been published concerning rodents but, based on the literature, the likely candidate species include the African genera Arvicanthis and Micaelamys and the widely introduced roof rat (Rattus rattus). Members of the orders Chiroptera and Rodentia should receive greater attention associated with new research programs. For the other orders mentioned above, few data are available. We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs.

When linked to globin genes, the locus control region confers a high level of erythroid-specific expression of these genes in transgenic mice or transfected erythroid cell lines. We have examined the effect of one of these sites, HS2, on human beta-globin gene expression in a murine erythroleukemia cell line (MEL) after retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. We incorporated a 732- or 412-base-pair (bp) segment of HS2 in the retroviral construct carrying the human beta-globin gene. These fragments rendered the viruses unstable as the human beta-globin gene was rearranged or deleted in all the packaging cell lines examined. On the other hand, when a 36-bp fragment containing the NFE-2/AP-1 binding consensus in this region was inserted into the retroviral construct, we recovered 6 stable packaging cell lines of 12 examined, similar in percentage to the construct with the beta-globin gene alone. The virus titers of the packaging cell lines from these two constructs were similar. We infected MEL cells with viruses produced from three packaging cell lines of each of the two constructs and measured the ratio of human beta-globin to mouse alpha-globin mRNA after hexamethylenebisacetamide induction. The overall level of expression increased 2-fold from 6.0% to 12.7% with the addition of this 36-bp enhancer.																					WOS:A1992HL81600123	1557419

Of the 16 hemagglutinin subtypes of avian influenza viruses, the H6 subtype is commonly perpetuated in its natural hosts and is of concern due to its potential to be a precursor of highly pathogenic influenza viruses by reassortment. During routine influenza surveillance, we isolated an unconventional H6N5 subtype of avian influenza virus. Experimental infection of mice revealed that this isolate replicated efficiently in the lungs, subsequently spread systemically, and caused lethality. The isolate also productively infected ferrets, with direct evidence of contact transmission, but no disease or transmission was seen in pigs. Although the isolate possessed the conserved receptor-binding site sequences of avian influenza viruses, it exhibited relatively low replication efficiencies in ducks and chickens. Our genetic and molecular analyses of the isolate revealed that its PB1 sequence showed the highest evolutionary relationship to those of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses and that its PA protein had an isoleucine residue at position 97 (a representative virulence marker). Further studies will be required to examine why our isolate has the virologic characteristics of mammalian influenza viruses but the archetypal receptor binding profiles of avian influenza viruses, as well as to determine whether its potential virulence markers (PB1 analogous to those of H5N1 viruses or isoleucine residue at position 97 within PA) could render it highly pathogenic in mice.

However, interspecies transmission had occasionally caused outbreaks in various hosts including humans. To characterize the genetic origins of H5 avian influenza viruses isolated from migratory birds in South Korea, phylogenetic analysis were conducted. A total of 53 H5 viruses were isolated between October 2005 and November 2008. Full genetic characterization indicated that most of these viruses belong to the Eurasian-like avian lineage. However, some segments of the AB/Korea/W235/07 and the AB/Korea/W236/07 isolates were clustered with North American lineage viruses rather than those of the Eurasian lineage, suggesting the occurrence of reassortment between these two avian virus lineages. Phylogenetic analysis further demonstrated that the H5N2 and H5N3 virus isolates were of the low pathogenicity H5 phenotype. The H5 viruses appear to be anti-genically similar to each other, but could be distinguished from a recent HPAI H5N1 (EM/Korea/W149/06) virus by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) assays. Experimental inoculation of representative viruses indicated that certain isolates, particularly AB/Korea/W163/07 (H5N2), could be detected in trachea and lungs of chickens but none could be transmitted by direct contact. Furthermore, all of the viruses could be detected in mice lung without prior adaptation which is indicative of their pathogenic potential in a mammalian host. Overall, our results emphasize the important role that migratory birds play in the perpetuation, transport, and reassortment of avian influenza viruses stressing the need for continued surveillance of influenza virus activity in these avian populations.

Therefore, developing rapid, sensitive, and efficient detection methods for swine influenza virus (SIV) is important. By aligning the haemagglutinin (HA) gene sequences of SIVs circulating in China over a 10-year period, an H1 primer-probe set targeting both Eurasian avian-like H1N1 (EA H1N1) and pandemic 2009 H1N1 ((H1N1)pdm09) lineages plus a H3 primer-probe set targeting the prevalent human-like H3N2 (HL H3N2) subtype were designed. Subsequently, a TaqMan-MGB-based duplex one-step real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) assay was established and evaluated. The duplex RT-qPCR has a detection limit of 5 copies/mu L of HA plasmid for EA H1N1, (H1N1)pdm09, and HL H3N2 subtype SIVs, and its overall detection sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 91.67% matches that of traditional virus isolation through chicken embryo inoculation using experimentally infected mouse lung samples. The method showed high repeatability both within run and between runs, and there was no cross-reactivity against several other porcine viruses that are commonly circulating in China. Furthermore, the duplex RT-qPCR method revealed a higher prevalence of subtype H1 than subtype H3 in 166 nasal swabs from pigs collected from one slaughterhouse between October and December 2019. This assay could be very helpful in the rapid differential detection and routine surveillance of EA H1N1, (H1N1)pdm09, and HL H3N2 SIVs in China.																					WOS:000658263100001	34091783

However, it is still unclear how these cells receive the crucial signals necessary for their longevity and homeostatic turnover. To understand how T-M cells receive these signals, we infected mice with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and examined the expression sites of neural cadherin (N-cadherin) by immunofluorescence microscopy. We found that N-cadherin was expressed in the surroundings of the white pulps of the spleen and medulla of lymph nodes (LNs). Moreover, T-M cells expressing high levels of killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), a ligand of N-cadherin, were co-localized with N-cadherin(+) cells in the spleen but not in LNs. We then blocked N-cadherin in vivo to investigate whether it regulates the formation or function of T-M cells. The numbers of CD127(hi)CD62L(hi) T-M cells in the spleen of memory P14 chimeric mice declined when N-cadherin was blocked during the contraction phase, without functional impairment of these cells. In addition, when CD127(lo)KLRG1(hi) T-M cells were adoptively transferred into anti- N-cadherin- treated mice compared with control mice, the number of these cells was reduced in the bone marrow and LNs, with-out functional loss. Taken together, our results suggest that N-cadherin participates in the development of CD127(hi)CD62L(hi) T-M cells and homing of CD127(lo)KLRG1(hi) T-M cells to lymphoid organs.

Craig								Type 1 Immune Mechanisms Driven by the Response to Infection with Attenuated Rabies Virus Result in Changes in the Immune Bias of the Tumor Microenvironment and Necrosis of Mouse GL261 Brain Tumors								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				198	11			4513	4523		10.4049/jimmunol.1601444				JUN 1 2017	2017	Immunotherapeutic strategies for malignant glioma have to overcome the immunomodulatory activities of M2 monocytes that appear in the circulation and as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). M2 cell products contribute to the growth-promoting attributes of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and bias immunity toward type 2, away from the type 1 mechanisms with antitumor properties. To drive type 1 immunity in CNS tissues, we infected GL261 tumor-bearing mice with attenuated rabies virus (RABV). These neurotropic viruses spread to CNS tissues trans-axonally, where they induce a strong type 1 immune response that involves Th1, CD8, and B cell entry across the blood-brain barrier and virus clearance in the absence of overt sequelae. Intranasal infection with attenuated RABV prolonged the survival of mice bearing established GL261 brain tumors. Despite the failure of virus spread to the tumor, infection resulted in significantly enhanced tumor necrosis, extensive CD4 T cell accumulation, and high levels of the proinflammatory factors IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and inducible NO synthase in the TME merely 4 d postinfection, before significant virus spread or the appearance of RABV-specific immune mechanisms in CNS tissues. Although the majority of infiltrating CD4 cells appeared functionally inactive, the proinflammatory changes in the TME later resulted in the loss of accumulating M2 and increased M1 TAMs. Mice deficient in the Th1 transcription factor T-bet did not gain any survival advantage from RABV infection, exhibiting only limited tumor necrosis and no change in TME cytokines or TAM phenotype and highlighting the importance of type 1 mechanisms in this process.

CNS-Wide over Expression of Fractalkine Improves Cognitive Functioning in a Tauopathy Model								JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNE PHARMACOLOGY				14	2			312	325		10.1007/s11481-018-9822-5				JUN 2019	2019	Accumulating evidence increasingly implicates regulation of neuroinflammation as a potential therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Fractalkine (FKN) is a unique chemokine that is expressed and secreted by neurons and reduces expression of pro-inflammatory genes. To further demonstrate the utility of agents that increase FKN signaling throughout the central nervous system as possible therapies for AD, we assessed the impact of soluble FKN (sFKN) over expression on cognition in tau depositing rTg450 mice after the onset of cognitive deficits. Using adeno-associated virus serotype 4, we infected cells lining the ventricular system with soluble FKN to increase FKN signaling over a larger fraction of the brain than achieved with intraparenchymal injections. We found that soluble FKN over expression by cells lining the ventricles significantly improved cognitive performance on the novel mouse recognition and radial arm water maze tasks. These benefits were achieved without detectable reductions in tau hyperphosphorylation, hippocampal atrophy, or microglial CD45 expression. Utilizing qPCR, we report a significant increase in Vegfa expression, indicating an increase in trophic support and possible neovascularization in AAV-sFKN-injected mice. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that FKN over expression can rescue cognitive function in a tau depositing mouse line.																					WOS:000468351800012	30499006

This paper is a summary of the present state of knowledge regarding Leishmaniasis in the dog. In subsequent papers the following conditions are to be dealt with: Experimental infections produced by L. infantum, and L. donovani, and natural and experimental infections with L. tropica.Natural infection in the Dog.-A historical survey is given from the discovery of the condition by NICOLLE and COMTE in 1908, the distribution of the disease being simultaneously dealt with.The clinical aspect of the disease is referred to, and the views held by different authors regarding the identity or otherwise of the canine disease with human leishmaniasis are summarised. The author concludes that " the probabilities appear to be in favour of the identity of L. infantum and the Leishmania that is responsible for natural infections in the dog." It is admitted that there are certain difficulties in the way of accepting this view. The principal objections are: - the inconstant association of the canine disease and the disease in children; the rare discovery of the canine disease in houses where there are human patients; and the failure to find cases of the disease in dogs in India, if the Indian and the Mediterranean disease are identical, as seems probable.The views of a number of authors regarding the methods of transmission of the parasite are briefly referred to, and the conclusion arrived at by the author is that the real manner of transmission has not yet been definitely discovered.Diagnosis can only be based upon the discovery of the parasite, and where these are scanty, cultivation should be resorted to. The tubes of medium (simplified Novy) must be incubated at 22° 0. for at least a month before being considered as negative.During life puncture of the liver may be resorted to. To achieve this the puncture must be made in the 10th intercostal space, one or two fingers' breadth from the summit of the dorsal spines. This method only succeeds when parasites are numerous. The femur may be trephined on its outer face for the taking of material for examination. It is probable that recovery frequently occurs in the dog, but no method of treatment is known.																					CABI:19156300018

Gene transfer of NMDAR1 antisense sequence into the rat hippocampus modifies learning and memory and GFP expression CO - localises with neuronal markers.								Society for Neuroscience Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner				2003				Abstract No. 860.14	Abstract No. 860.14						2003	2003	The challenge was to get an NMDAR1 knock-down with temporal and spatial restrictions in the rat brain. Amplicons are helper-dependent herpes simplex type-1 derived vectors, originated from a plasmid containing an origin of replication and a packaging sequence (a), in addition to the transgenic transcription unit. Since this plasmid does not encode any further viral gene, it must only be grown and packaged in the presence of a helper virus providing the trans-acting functions. We developed amplicon vectors carrying the sense and antisense transcription unit for the NMDAR1, and for the GFP, under different promoters, with a LaL helper system where the (a) signal in the helper virus is flanked by LoxP. Then we infected Cre cells with the obtained mixture of vectors and that LaL helper virus. The (a) signal was deleted, and hence, that viral genome could not be encapsidated. The resulting stock was almost free of helper virus. The vectors were injected into the dorsal hippocampus of adult rats. The immunocytochemistry revealed that transgene expression was reduced to a small region in the dorsal hippocampus, and co-localises with neuronal markers in pyramidal and granule cells. There was a mild inflammatory reaction. Rats injected with vectors carrying the antisense transcription unit for NMDAR1 showed significant impairments in different learning tasks, either in predominantly spatial or aversive tasks. With this system it is feasible to safely deliver genes in vivo, mainly to neurons, in a restricted region of the brain. The NMDAR1 in neurons of the dorsal hippocampus appears involved in processing learning and memory, with both spatial and non-spatial components.					33rd Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience33rd Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience	November 08-12, 2003November 08-12, 2003	Society of NeuroscienceSociety of Neuroscience	New Orleans, LA, USANew Orleans, LA, USA													BCI:BCI200400205573

A/J mice recover from a mild disease after 4-6 days of infection and the BALB/c mice develop an acute hepatitis and die after 3-4 days of infection. In view of studying the MHV3 binding to cells or cell extracts, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-like virus-binding assay, preparing microplates with L929 cells, A/J or BALB/c mouse macrophages and also with proteins extracted from these cells. Higher MHV3 bindings were observed to proteins of BALB/c macrophages than to the A/J ones. The interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activation led to a reduction of MHV3 binding only to proteins of resistant A/J mouse macrophages. Our experiments contribute to the hypothesis that IFN-gamma activation of macrophages plays an important role against MHV3 infection by downregulating the expression of viral receptors.

Human GDPD3 overexpression promotes liver steatosis by increasing lysophosphatidic acid production and fatty acid uptake								JOURNAL OF LIPID RESEARCH				61	7			1075	1086		10.1194/jlr.RA120000760				JUL 2020	2020	The glycerol phosphate pathway produces more than 90% of the liver triacylglycerol (TAG). LysoPA, an intermediate in this pathway, is produced by glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. Glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase domain containing 3 (GDPD3), whose gene was recently cloned, contains lysophospholipase D activity, which produces LysoPA from lysophospholipids. Whether human GDPD3 plays a role in hepatic TAG homeostasis is unknown. We hypothesized that human GDPD3 increases LysoPA production and availability in the glycerol phosphate pathway, promoting TAG biosynthesis. To test our hypothesis, we infected C57BL/6J mice with adeno-associated virus encoding a hepatocyte-specific albumin promoter that drives GFP (control) or FLAG-tagged humanGDPD3overexpression and fed the mice chow or a Western diet to induce hepatosteatosis. Hepatic humanGDPD3overexpression induced LysoPA production and increased FA uptake and incorporation into TAG in mouse hepatocytes and livers, ultimately exacerbating Western diet-induced liver steatosis. Our results also showed that individuals with hepatic steatosis have increasedGDPD3mRNA levels compared with individuals without steatosis. Collectively, these findings indicate that upregulation of GDPD3 expression may play a key role in hepatic TAG accumulation and may represent a molecular target for managing hepatic steatosis.

J	Parker, Dane; Prince, Alice								Staphylococcus aureus Induces Type I IFN Signaling in Dendritic Cells Via TLR9								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				189	8			4040	4046		10.4049/jimmunol.1201055				OCT 15 2012	2012	The importance of type I IFN signaling in the innate immune response to viral and intracellular pathogens is well established, with an increasing literature implicating extracellular bacterial pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, in this signaling pathway. Airway epithelial cells and especially dendritic cells (DCs) contribute to the production of type I IFNs in the lung. We were interested in establishing how S. aureus activates the type I IFN cascade in DCs. In vitro studies confirmed the rapid uptake of S. aureus by DCs followed promptly by STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of IFN-beta. Signaling occurred using heat-killed organisms and in the absence of PVL and alpha-toxin. Consistent with the participation of endosomal and not cytosolic receptors, signaling was predominantly mediated by MyD88, TLR9, and IRF1 and blocked by cytochalasin D, dynasore, and chloroquine. To determine the role of TLR9 signaling in the pathogenesis of S. aureus pneumonia, we infected WT and Tlr9(-/-) mice with MRSA USA300. Tlr9(-/-) mice had significantly improved clearance of S. aureus from the airways and lung tissue. Ifnar(-/-) mice also had improved clearance. This enhanced clearance in Tlr9(-/-) mice was not due to differences in the numbers of recruited neutrophils into the airways, but instead correlated with decreased induction of TNF. Thus, we identified TLR9 as the critical receptor mediating the induction of type I IFN signaling in DCs in response to S. aureus, illustrating an additional mechanism through which S. aureus exploits innate immune signaling to facilitate infection.

Some inactivation occurred at 37[degree] C on the alkaline side of pH 8.0. The survival of virulent bluetongue virus in carcass meat probably depends upon the post mortem pH changes. The virus persisted for 30 days at 4 [degree] C in an ovine carcass where the pH of the meat failed to drop below pH 6.3.

J	Raghavan, S; Holmgren, J								CD4+CD25+ suppressor T cells regulate pathogen induced inflammation and disease								FEMS IMMUNOLOGY AND MEDICAL MICROBIOLOGY				44	2			121	127		10.1016/j.femsim.2004.10.017				MAY 1 2005	2005	A key suppressor role has recently been ascribed to the natural CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg), the removal of which leads to the development of autoimmune disease and aggravated pathogen-induced inflammation in otherwise normal hosts. The repertoire of antigen specificities of Treg is as broad as that of naive T cells, recognizing both self and non-self antigens, enabling Treg to control a broad range of immune responses. Although widely acknowledged to play a role in the maintenance of self-tolerance, recent studies indicate that Treg can be activated and expanded against bacterial, viral and parasite antigens in vivo. Such pathogen-specific Treg can prevent infection-induced immunopathology but may also increase the load of infection and prolong pathogen persistence by suppressing protective immune responses. This review discusses the role of Treg in the prevention of exaggerated inflammation favoring chronicity in bacterial or fungal infections and latency in viral infections. Special attention is given to the role of Treg in the modulation of gastric inflammation induced by Helicobacter pylori infection. Findings in both experimentally infected mice and humans with natural infection indicate that Treg are important in protecting the H. pylori-infected host against excessive gastric inflammation and disease symptoms but on the negative side promote bacterial colonization at the gastric and duodenal mucosa which may increase the risk in H. pylori-infected individuals to develop duodenal ulcers.

Our laboratory's previous research has shown that SADS-CoV can replicate in various cell types from different species, including chickens. Here, we systematically explore the susceptibility of chickens to a cell-adapted SADS-CoV strain both in vitro and in vivo. First, evidence of SADS-CoV replication in primary chicken cells, including cytopathic effects, immunofluorescence staining, growth curves and structural protein expression, was proven. Furthermore, we observed that SADS-CoV replicated in chicken embryos without causing gross lesions and that experimental infection of chicks resulted in mild respiratory symptoms. More importantly, SADS-CoV shedding and viral distribution in the lungs, spleens, small intestines and large intestines of infected chickens were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. The genomic sequence of the original SADS-CoV from the pig source sample in 2017 was determined to have nine nucleotide differences compared to the cell-adapted strain used; among these were three nonsynonymous mutations in the spike gene. These results collectively demonstrate that chickens are susceptible to SADS-CoV infection, suggesting that they are a potential animal reservoir. To our knowledge, this study provides the first experimental evidence of cross-species infection in which a mammalian alphacoronavirus is able to infect an avian species.

The rNP is expressed in insoluble form in hemolymph; therefore simple washing of the insoluble fraction with phosphate-buffered saline by low-speed centrifugation allowed preparation of purified antigen for WB. The rNP had strain-specific and hantavirus-common epitopes similar to the authentic NP antigen of hantavirus and was stable after transfer to membrane. For detection of antibody in serially obtained sera from experimentally infected rats, WB enabled detection of IgM antibodies 3 days after infection, which was at least 2 days earlier than detection by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFA). Thus WB had a higher sensitivity than the IFA for detection of hantavirus antibody in the serum of experimentally infected rats. The WB-determined IgG antibody titer was about 10 times higher than that determined by the IFA. No background staining was observed by WB even at a 1:10 dilution of serum. The selected rat sera with strong background staining or confusing staining patterns by LFA, but not focus reduction neutralization test titers, could be interpreted as test-negative because they did not have a specific reaction to virus antigen by WB. Thus the specificity of WB was higher than that of the IFA. Moreover, WB can distinguish specific from nonspecific reactions by the detection of the specific antigen on the WB membrane. Therefore the IFA or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay followed by WB is recommended for serologic confirmation of hantavirus infection.																					WOS:A1995TL46700004	8746523

Hypergammaglobulinemia appears early in patients with VL and is ineffective. Usually, high-affinity IgG B cells are selected during most infections, a critical step for an effective humoral response. The avidity of IgG antibodies in VL is unexplored due to the absence of temporal parameters in most patients, associated to low clinical significance. Experimental infection models overcome this fact, allowing the monitoring of the disease temporal evolution. In this study, the avidity of IgG antibodies was evaluated in experimental models, in infection in hamsters, and in immunization in rabbits. Specific IgG antibodies were detected by ELISA, using chaotropic solution to determine avidity, as reported for viral infections. The levels of IgG antibodies correlated with the progression of experimental infection in hamsters or antigenic stimulation in immunized rabbits. However, IgG avidity was high early in infected animals, even in early periods (> 80%), while in immunized rabbits, they had early antibodies of low avidity with progressive maturation, similar as other infections. These data suggest that the affinity maturation of the avidity of anti-LeishmaniaIgG antibodies promoted at an early stage, influencing the appropriate interaction between antigens and affecting the disease progression. This fact could be associated to monovalent immune complexes, as reported in human and experimental VL. This scenario may be related to an independent process of immune cell activation by the parasite but absent in antigen preparation used as immunogens.

The observations have been compared to the literature data. Dogs are usually infected by internal organs of pigs (e.g. lungs, kidneys) or more rarely by pork meat. The clinical symptoms develop after an incubation period of 2 to 6 days. At the early stage of the disease, the patients show depression or restlessness and fever in most cases. Later on, tachypnoea and dyspnoea can be observed. At this stage, central nervous symptoms dominate the clinical picture: (usually mild) aggression, ptyalism due to pharyngolaryngeal paralysis and intense pruritus or even paresthesia (Figs 1a, 1b and 2). Dogs die within 48, sometimes 96 hours after the first clinical signs. AD can be suspected and differentiated from other diseases of central nervous system on the basis of the history, clinical signs and its rapid progression (Table). A definitive diagnosis can be established by histological examination of the brain, isolation the virus from the brain or - if it necessary - by experimental inoculation of mice.

Geoffroy) maintained in captivity by feeding defibrinated blood added with rabies virus.								Brazilian Journal of Veterinary Research and Animal Science				46	2			92	100						2009	2009	In vampire bats, food sharing behavior would contribute for the oral transmission of rabies virus among the roostmates. To test this hypothesis, 10 captive Desmodus rotundus bats were fed defibrinated swine blood containing mice brain suspension of PV-strain of rabies virus. Other 10 bats were fed blood mixed with a mice brain suspension of T-9/95 vampire-bat-field isolate of rabies virus. Another group of 10 bats was inoculated intramuscularly with a mice brain suspension of the T-9/95 isolate. Other 20 bats were maintained without treatment and fed defibrinated swine blood for 158 days. All animals found dead during the observation period or those sacrificed at the end of the experiment were necropsied and specimens such as the brain and non-nervous tissues were collected for rabies examination. hour bats inoculated intramuscularly developed clinical rabies, with signs lasting 1-2 days, and the survival periods ranged from 11-14 days. The initial rabies diagnosis was based on direct fluorescent antibody (dFA) and mouse inoculation test (MIT) performed only on brain specimens, and subsequently, brains and the non-nervous materials were further reexamined by means of dFA, MIT and heminested-polymerase chain reaction (ht-PCR) technique. The intake of the PV-strain caused rabies in 2 bats, with survival period of 25 and 32 days, while the three bats ingesting the T-9/95 isolate presented periods of 26-31 days. Although discrepant results were found among the diagnostic tests, viruses have disseminated to the central nervous system and other organs, as seen in bats inoculated intramuscularly.

Therefore, the Federation of Laboratory Animal Science Associations (FELASA) recommends an annual screening in laboratory mice as part of a thorough health monitoring program. Based on the high protein sequence homology among the different reovirus serotypes, immunofluorescence antibody assay and other indirect methods relying on the whole virus are presumably cross-reactive to antibodies triggered by mammalian orthoreovirus infections independent of the serotype.Methods: The serotype-specific protein sigma-1 was expressed in Escherichia coli with an N-terminal Strep-tag and a C-terminal His-tag. The purified Strep-r sigma-1-His-construct was used to develop an indirect ELISA by testing defined positive and negative sera obtained by experimental infection of mice as well as field sera.Results: The Strep-r sigma-1-His-ELISA provided high sensitivity and specificity during validation. Notably, a high selectivity was also observed for sera positively tested for other relevant FELASA-listed pathogens. Screening of field samples indicated that a commercial reovirus type-3-based ELISA might be cross-reactive to other murine reovirus serotypes and thus produces false-positive results.Conclusions: The prevalence of reovirus type-3 might be overestimated in German animal facilities and most likely in other countries as well. The occurrence of other reovirus serotypes, however, raises the question if murine health monitoring programs should be extended to these pathogens.																					WOS:000440004800001	30049287

One of the genes, ORF4, encodes an immediate-early protein that is present in the virion tegument. ORF4 RNA and protein have been detected in latently infected human ganglia. We have constructed a VZV mutant deleted for ORF4 and have shown that the gene is essential for replication in vitro. The ORF4 mutant virus could be propagated when grown in cells infected with baculovirus expressing the ORF4 protein under the human cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter. In contrast, the VZV ORF4 deletion mutant could not be complemented in cells expressing herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) ICP27, the homolog of ORF4. Cells infected with baculovirus expressing ORF4 did not complement an HSV-1 ICP27 deletion mutant. VZV-infected cotton rats have been used as a model for latency; viral DNA and latency-associated transcripts are expressed in dorsal root ganglia 1 month or more after experimental infection. Cotton rats inoculated with VZV lacking ORF4 showed reduced frequency of latency compared to animals infected with the parental or ORF4-rescued virus. Thus, in addition to VZV ORF63, which was previously shown to be critical for efficient establishment of latency, ORF4 is also important for latent infection.

Activation of the maternal immune system alters cerebellar development in the offspring								BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY				23	1			116	123		10.1016/j.bbi.2008.07.012				JAN 2009	2009	A common pathological finding in autism is a localized deficit in Purkinje cells (PCs). Cerebellar abnormalities have also been reported in schizophrenia. Using a mouse model that exploits a known risk factor for these disorders, maternal infection, we asked if the offspring of pregnant mice given a mid-gestation respiratory infection have cerebellar pathology resembling that seen in these disorders. We also tested the effects of maternal immune activation in the absence of virus by injection of the synthetic dsRNA, poly(I:C). We infected pregnant mice with influenza on embryonic day 9.5 (E9.5), or injected poly(I:C) i.p. on E12.5, and assessed the linear density of PCs in the cerebellum of adult or postnatal day 11 (P11) offspring. To study granule cell migration, we also injected BrdU on P11. Adult offspring of influenza- or poly(I:C)-exposed mice display a localized deficit in PCs in lobule VII of the cerebellum, as do P11 offspring. Coincident with this are heterotopic PCs, as well as delayed migration of granule cells in lobules VI and VII. The cerebellar pathology observed in the offspring of influenza- or poly(I:C)-exposed mice is strikingly similar to that observed in autism. The poly(I:C) findings indicate that deficits are likely caused by the activation of the maternal immune system. Finally, our data suggest that cerebellar abnormalities occur during embryonic development, and may be an early deficit in autism and schizophrenia. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Non-infected gerbils served as the control group. Feces samples from gerbils were collected weekly for reverse transcription-nested polymerase chain reaction. Serum anti-HEV IgG and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. At sacrifice, each animal's liver, spleen and kidney were collected for histopathologic examination.RESULTS: HEV-infected gerbils showed fatigue, with histopathological changes observed in the liver, spleen and kidney. HEV RNA was detected in fecal samples taken at day 7 after inoculation and the detectable levels lasted out to day 42 after inoculation. Interestingly, ALT levels were only moderately increased in the HEV-infected animals compared with the noninfected control group.CONCLUSION: Z: ZCLA Mongolian gerbils are susceptible to human HEV.

J	GOMEZ M M; BOXACA M C								EFFECT OF EXPERIMENTAL JUNIN VIRUS INFECTION ON PREGNANT GUINEA-PIGS								Revista Argentina de Microbiologia				13	1			35	40						1981	1981	Five pregnant guinea-pigs infected with the pathogenic Junin XJ strain (prototype strain) died 9-15 days post-inoculation (pi) with fetus retention in utero. Mother and fetus showed the characteristic postmortem hemorrhagic signs. Virus was recovered from all the specimens tested except the mothers' brain, reproducing the pattern observed in nonpregnant guinea-pigs. The presence of virus in placenta, amniotic fluids and membranes suggests that transplacental infection took place. The inoculation of 23 animals (8 before fecundation and 15 during pregnancy) with the XJo, an attenuated variant of the XJ strain, showed a high mortality (44%) as compared with 12% obtained in nonpregnant guinea pigs under the same experimental conditions and with 16% of noninfected pregnant guinea-pigs. All the infected guinea-pigs had a term pregnancy; no miscarriages or intrauterine death were observed and the mothers died shortly after delivery. No evidence of transplacental infection was obtained. The highest mortality for mothers (78%) occurred when the critical period of disease overlapped with the predelivery period. All the animals showed signs of sickness and 7 died. All of their newborns died but no virus was isolated from their organs. Mortality was lower among the females infected before fecundation or during the 1st third of pregnancy (21%), but 55% of their litters died during their 1st wk of life. This mortality could be accounted for by a direct or indirect virus effect.																					BCI:BCI198274010969	6287523

We previously reported that two AIV strains (subtypes H6N2 and H3N8) isolated from wild waterfowl in Zambia harbored some amino acid residues preferentially associated with human influenza virus proteins (so-called human signatures) and replicated better in the lungs of infected mice and caused more morbidity than a strain lacking such residues. To further substantiate these observations, we infected chickens and mice intranasally with AIV strains of various subtypes (H3N6, H3N8, H4N6, H6N2, H9N1 and H11N9) isolated from wild waterfowl in Zambia. Although some strains induced seroconversion, all of the tested strains replicated poorly and were nonpathogenic for chickens. In contrast, most of the strains having human signatures replicated well in the lungs of mice, and one of these strains caused severe illness in mice and induced lung injury that was characterized by a severe accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. These results suggest that some strains tested in this study may have the potential to infect mammalian hosts directly without adaptation, which might possibly be associated with the possession of human signature residues. Close monitoring and evaluation of host-associated signatures may help to elucidate the prevalence and emergence of AIVs with potential for causing zoonotic infections.

Rapid isolation, serotyping and vaccine matching of FMDV from infected animals is critical to enable the implementation of effective vaccination programs and to stop the spread of infection during outbreaks. Current virus isolation protocols use primary cells, known to be susceptible to FMDV, or baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) and other cell lines that are not highly sensitive to some strains of FMDV. The alpha (V)beta (6 )integrin is a principal receptor for FMDV. We therefore transduced the porcine kidney cell line, LFBK, to stably express both the alpha (V )and beta (6 )bovine integrin subunits. The LFBK-alpha (V)beta (6 )cell line showed both beta (6 )expression and enhanced susceptibility to FMDV infection for at least 100 cell passages. LFBK-alpha (V)beta (6 )cells are highly sensitive for detecting all serotypes of FMDV from experimentally infected animals, including the porcinophillic strain O/TAW/97 and are thus a sensitive tool for FMDV isolation.

After the eradication of the H5N1 viruses that emerged in Hong Kong in 1997 (HK/97 viruses), new genotypes of H5N1 viruses emerged in the same region in 2000 that were more pathogenic for both chickens and mice than HK/97 viruses. These, as well as virtually all highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses since 2000, harbour a deletion of aa 80-84 in the unstructured region of the non-structural (NS) protein NS1 linking its RNA-binding domain to its effector domain. NS segments harbouring this mutation have since been found in non-H5N1 viruses and we asked whether this 5 aa deletion could have a general effect not limited to the NS1 of H5N1 viruses. We genetically engineered this deletion in the NS segment of a duck-origin avian H1N1 virus, and compared the in vivo and in vitro properties of the WT and NSdel8084 viruses. In experimentally infected chickens, the NSdel8084 virus showed both an increased replication potential and an increased pathogenicity. This in vivo phenotype was correlated with a higher replicative efficiency in vitro, both in embryonated eggs and in a chicken lung epithelial cell line. Our data demonstrated that the increased replicative potential conferred by this small deletion was a general feature not restricted to NS1 from H5N1 viruses and suggested that viruses acquiring this mutation may be selected positively in the future.

We have developed a new electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA) for the detection of antibodies to BDV, using three synthetic peptides corresponding to the amino acid residues 3 20 and 338 358 of p40 and 59-79 of p24 peptide of BDV. Using the ECLIA, we examined serum samples for the presence of anti-BDV antibodies in 20 rats (experimentally BDV-infected and uninfected) and 38 horses (13 US horses. experimentally infected and uninfected, and 25 Japanese horses, feral and domestic).The ECLIA, performed in a double-blind manner. detected anti-BDV antibodies in rats with a history of BDV infection. giving results that were in agreement with indirect immunofluorescence assay Lind, or Western blot (WB) analysis. The ECLIA also correctly identified all three experimentally infected horses and four domestic American horses that were seropositive for BDV antibodies by WB. Among the Japanese horses, at least two out of 10 feral and Six Out Of 15 domestic horses were seropositive for BDV. In most of these cases. the specificity of immunoreactivity was verified by blocking with Soluble p40 and p24 peptides.																					WOS:000172758200008	11471876

Progress in Modern Biomedicine				13	9			1639	1644						2013	2013	The study was conducted to determine the effect of recombinant human interferon-alpha1b on T lymphocyte subsets in the peripheral blood and lung tissue of mice infected with Respiratory syncytial virus. A total of 40 BALB/C mice were randomly divided into: normal control group, infection model group, and recombinant human interferon-alpha1b dose of 3.125, 12.5 and 50 g groups. After the experimental infection, continuous atomized intervention was performed for 5 days, and the peripheral blood was collected from eyes for CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8+ levels determination by flow cytometer on day 6. Left lung tissue was collected and processed for histopathology. Results revealed that the CD3+CD8+ levels in peripheral blood of all treatment groups were significantly lower than the normal control group. CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+ levels were significantly higher in mice treated with 50 g recombinant human interferon-alpha1b. The CD3+CD8+ levels in peripheral blood of the treatment and control groups were significantly higher than the infection group. It was observed that the CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+ were significantly lower in mice treated with 3.125 g interferon-alpha1b. The levels of CD3+CD8+ was directly proportional with the increasing dose of human interferon-alpha1b which was highest in 50 g group. On the other hand, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD4+/CD3+CD8+ levels were inversely proportional to increasing dose of human interferon-alpha1b which was lowest in 50 g. Histopathology of the lung tissues showed severe inflammatory damage, but significantly reduced after atomized inhalation of recombinant human interferon-alpha1b. It is concluded that recombinant human interferon-alpha1b has significant impact on the T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood and lung tissue pathology of mice infected by Respiratory syncytial virus that are associated with antiviral and immunomodulating properties.

A survey of avian influenza viruses was conducted on tree sparrows (Passer montanus) collected in China in 2004. Four viruses were isolated from free-living tree sparrows. The results of the whole-genome analysis indicated that an H5N1 virus with a new genotype is circulating among tree sparrows. The hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of the new genotype were derived from Gs/Gd/96-like viruses and the nuclear protein gene descended from the 2001 genotype A H5N1 viruses, while the other inner genes originated from an unknown influenza virus. In experimental infection, all four viruses were highly pathogenic to chickens but not pathogenic to ducks or mice. The four tree sparrow viruses were different from the 2003 tree sparrow strain (genotype Z) in Hong Kong. The results suggested that H5N1 viruses might be distributed widely in tree sparrows.																					WOS:000234276700047	16306617

Demyelination is T-cell mediated in this model. Previously, we demonstrated that T cells not specific for JHM or central nervous system (CNS) antigens could induce demyelination ("bystander demyelination"). In the previous study, we infected P14 mice (transgenic mice with TCR specific for LCMV CD8 T cell epitope GP33-41) with JHM and activated the T cells with GP33 peptide in CFA. Because IFN-( is required for demyelination mediated by JHM-specific CD8 T cells, we reasoned that it might also be necessary for demyelination induced by activated P14 T cells. To determine whether IFN-( produced specifically by lymphocytes was required for this process, we created bone marrow chimeras using P14 IFN-(-/- RAG-/- mice as donors and RAG-/- mice as recipients, to ensure that non-T-cell sources of IFN-( were present. JHM-infected IFN-(-/- chimeras did not develop demyelination while IFN-(+/+ chimeras exhibited bystander demyelination. This lack of demyelination in IFN-(-/- chimeras was not due to differences in T cell activation or migration into the CNS. Finally, we did not observe differences in the mRNA levels of several cytokines and chemokines in the CNS, suggesting that the presence of IFN-( was the critical element in effecting demyelination in this model.

J	JOHNSON, HAROLD N.								The significance of the Negri body in the diagnosis and epidemiology of rabies								ILLINOIS MED JOUR				81	(5)			382	387						1942	1942	Dog-brain specimens sent to the laboratories of the Georgia and Alabama State Health Depts. for diagnosis of rabies during 1937-1939 were examined microscopically for the presence of Negri bodies and were then tested by mouse inoculation. 711 specimens were found positive for rabies by the inoculation test of which 10.5% did not show Negri bodies. 137 fox-brain specimens were found positive by the inoculation test of which 9.4% were Negri-negative. 92 specimens from dogs vaccinated within a yr. before the onset of rabies were found to be positive and of these 14% were Negri-negative. Of 188 dogs experimentally infected with rabies by intra-musc. inoculation 39.7% were Negri-negative. Of the 188 dogs 46% developed furious rabies and of these 21% were Negri-negative; 54% of the dogs developed paralytic rabies and of these 52% were Negri-negative. There was no difference in the incidence of absence of Negri bodies between vaccinated and unvaccinated dogs. With regard to duration of symptoms before death, Negri-positive dogs showed an av. of 3.3 days against an av. of 1.2 days for Negri-negative dogs. The authors recommend testing of Negri-negative specimens by mouse inoculation when a human has been exposed or when there were circumstances suggestive of rabies. Use of the white mouse as a test animal and of Seller's rapid microscopic diagnosis method is recommended. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. N. Wolf																					BCI:BCI19421600022661

The isolates were shown to be low pathogenic for chicken by the examination performed using the "Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines" by World organisation for Animal Health (OIE). The deduced amino acid sequence at the cleavage site was PE (I/Q/L) PKRR (nucleotide sequences were cct gaa (a/c) (t/a) a cc (a/g) aaa aga aga), suggesting persistence in domestic poultry for some time. The direct putative ancestor strain could not be elucidated by phylogenetic analysis of all genome segments of the quail isolates. Diverged date from a putative common ancestor in a non-rooted phylogenetic tree among quail viruses was estimated between March 2002 and July 2004. Three putative N-linked glycosylation sites resided in the vicinity of the receptor binding pocket of HA1 region. They are considered to decrease the reactivity of neutralizing antibody against the virus. Experiments for the infectivity and pathogenicity of a quail strain to poultry indicated that the quail isolate had higher infectivity to quails than chickens and ducks. Direct and dust-borne and/or droplet-borne transmissions among quail were proven in quails with and without direct contact with experimentally infected quails. The virus is seldom transmitted among chickens either directly or indirectly, and indirect transmission from infected quails to chickens was not observed. The pathogenicity of the quail strain for mammalian, pig and mouse was low, although it could replicate in those animals. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Experimental infection of fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) with West Nile virus								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				75	4			697	701		10.4269/ajtmh.2006.75.697				OCT 2006	2006	Tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.) have exhibited high seroprevalence rates, suggesting that they are commonly exposed to West Nile virus (WNV). Many characteristics of WNV infections in tree squirrels, such as the durations and levels of viremia, remain unknown. To better understand WNV infections in fox squirrels (S. niger), we subcutaneously inoculated fourteen fox squirrels with WNV. Peak viremias ranged from 10(4.00) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL of serum on day 2 post-infection (DPI) to 10(4.98) PFU/mL on 3 DPI, although viremias varied between individuals. Oral secretions of some fox squirrels were positive for WNV viral RNA, occasionally to moderate levels (10(3.2) PFU equivalent/swab). WNV PFU equivalents in organs were low or undetectable on 12 DPI; gross and histologic lesions were rare. The viremia profiles of fox squirrels indicate that they could serve as amplifying hosts in nature. In addition, viral RNA in the oral cavity and feces indicate that this species could contribute to alternative WNV transmission in suburban communities.

Strain A/Chicken/Kurgan/05/2005 (subtype H5N1) of the avian influenza virus showed high virulence with respect to mice ICR. Theoretically-based calculations allowed to design an optimal therapeutic and prophylactic dose of the drug for the mice (1000 units/animal). It was observed that only after prophylactic use of Reaferon-ES lipint (R) it was effective in protection of the mice infected with 10 LD50 of the avian influenza virus (A/Chicken/Kurgan/05/2005, H5N1). The protection coefficient was 0.35. Under such conditions the drug efficacy was comparable with that of Tamiflu. Therefore, Reaferon-ES lipint (R) could be recommended for prophylaxis of the infection due not only to the season strains of the influenza virus, but also to the strains of the avian influenza virus.

Characterization of an H5N1 avian influenza virus from Taiwan								VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY				124	3-4			193	201		10.1016/j.vetmic.2007.04.021				OCT 6 2007	2007	In 2003, an avian influenza (AI) virus of H5N1 subtype (A/Duck/China/E319-2/03; Dk/CHN/E319-2/03) was isolated from a smuggled duck in Kinmen Island of Taiwan. Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that the virus displayed high similarity to the H5N1 viruses circulating in Asia during 2004 and 2005. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the virus contained multiple basic amino acid residues (-RERRRKR-) adjacent to the cleavage site between the HA1 and HA2 domains, showing the highly pathogenic (HP) characteristics. The HP phenotype was confirmed by experimental infection of chickens, which led up to 100% mortality within 24-72 h postinfection. The virus replicated equally well in the majority of organs of the infected chickens with titers ranging from 10(7.5) to 10(4.7) 50% embryo lethal dose (ELD50) per gram of tissue. In a mouse model the virus exhibits low pathogenic characteristics with a lethal infection observed only after applying high inoculating dose (>= 10(7.6) ELD50) of the virus. The infectious virus particles were recovered only from the pulmonary system including trachea and lungs. Our study suggests that ducks infected with H5N1 AIV of HPAI pathotype showing no disease signs can carry the virus silently and that bird smuggling represent a serious risk for H5N1 HPAI transmission.

To identify cells supporting primary MV infection, we took advantage of mice expressing the MV receptor human signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) with human-like tissue specificity. We infected these mice intranasally (IN) with a wild-type MV expressing green fluorescent protein. One, two, or three days after inoculation, nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), the lungs, several lymph nodes (LNs), the spleen, and the thymus were collected and analyzed by microscopy and flow cytometry, and virus isolation was attempted. One day after inoculation, MV replication was documented only in the airways, in about 2.5% of alveolar macrophages (AM) and 0.5% of dendritic cells (DC). These cells expressed human SLAM, and it was observed that MV infection temporarily enhanced SLAM expression. Later, MV infected other immune cell types, including B and T lymphocytes. Virus was isolated from lymphatic tissue as early as 2 days post-IN inoculation; the mediastinal lymph node was an early site of replication and supported high levels of infection. Three days after intraperitoneal inoculation, 1 to 8% of the mediastinal LN cells were infected. Thus, MV infection of alveolar macrophages and subepithelial dendritic cells in the airways precedes infection of lymphocytes in lymphatic organs of mice expressing human SLAM with human-like tissue specificity.

Functional recombinant protein in stable co-transfected cell line								Biotechnology Journal				2	1			102	109		10.1002/biot.200600211				JAN 2007	2007	Recombinant rabies virus glycoprotein (rRVGP) was expressed in Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2) cells. The cDNA encoding the entire RVGP gene was cloned in an expression plasmid under the control of the constitutive actin promoter (Ac), which was co-transfected into S2 cells together with a hygromycin selection plasmid. Selected S2 cell populations (S2AcRVGP) had a decreased ability to grow and consume substrates, when compared to the non-transfected cells (S2). They were shown, by PCR, to express the RVGP gene and mRNA and, by immunoblotting, to synthesize the rRVGP in its expected molecular mass of 65 kDa. ELISA kinetic studies showed the rRVGP expression in cell lysates and supernatants attaining concentrations of 300 mu g/L. By flow cytometry analysis, about 30% of the cells in the co-transfected populations were shown to express the rRVGP. Cell populations selected by limiting dilution expressed higher rRVGP yields. Mice immunized with rRVGP were shown to synthesize antibodies against rabies virus and be protected against experimental infection with rabies virus. The data presented here show that S2 cells can be suitable hosts for the rRVGP expression, allowing its synthesis in a high degree of physical and biological integrity.

FoxP3(+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) critically control and suppress innate and adaptive immune responses. However, their specific role during MCMV infection, especially pertaining to their interaction with NK cells, remains incompletely defined.Methods: To understand the contribution of Tregs on NK cell function during acute MCMV infection, we infected Treg depleted and undepleted DEREG mice with WT MCMV and examined Treg and NK cell frequency, number, activation and effector function in vivo.Results: Our results reveal an increased frequency of activated Tregs within the CD4(+) T cell population shortly after MCMV infection. Specific depletion of Tregs in DEREG mice under homeostatic conditions leads to an increase in NK cell number as well as to a higher activation status of these cells as compared with non-depleted controls. Interestingly, upon infection this effect on NK cells is completely neutralized in terms of cell frequency, CD69 expression and functionality with respect to IFN-gamma production. Furthermore, composition of the NK cell population with regard to Ly49H expression remains unchanged. In contrast, absence of Tregs still boosts the general T cell response upon infection to a level comparable to the enhanced activation seen in uninfected mice. CD4(+) T cells especially benefit from Treg depletion exhibiting a two-fold increase of CD69(+) cells 40 h and IFN-gamma(+) cells 7 days p.i. while, MCMV infection per se induces robust CD8(+) T cell activation which is also further augmented in Treg depleted mice. Nevertheless, the viral burden in the liver and spleen remain unaltered upon Treg ablation during the course of infection.Conclusions: Thus, MCMV infection abolishes Treg suppressing effects on NK cells whereas T cells benefit from their absence during acute infection. This study provides novel information in understanding the collaborative interaction between NK cells and Tregs during a viral infection and provides further knowledge that could be adopted in therapeutic setups to improve current treatment of organ transplant patients where modulation of Tregs is envisioned as a strategy to overcome transplant rejection.

We have described that immunization with a plasmid containing a gene encoding a parasite antigen elicits specific type 1 protective immune responses against experimental infection with the human protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. However, we had evidence suggesting that DNA immunization concomitantly activated specific type 2 immune responses. To determine precisely the influence of the type 2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4) during DNA immunization, we compared the immune responses of genetically modified IL-4-deficient or wild-type (wt) BALB/c mice. IL-4-deficient mice had a significantly lower ratio of specific serum IgG1/IgG2a, and on in vitro restimulation with antigen, their spleen cells secreted significantly higher amounts of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). In contrast, absence of IL-4 did not affect total serum antibody response, T cell proliferative responses, or activation of IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells. Our results suggested that in contrast to conventional adjuvants, such as alum and complete Freund's adjuvant, specific IgG1 in DNA-immunized BALB/c mice was highly dependent on IL-4. To our knowledge, our study provides the first evidence that endogenous IL-4 selectively downregulates the type 1 CD4(+) T cell-mediated immune response induced by i.m. genetic immunization, a fact that may have implications for the design of certain DNA vaccines.

Rabies was confirmed in dogs that died by mouse inoculation and subsequent examination of mouse brains by fluorescent antibody technique to detect rabies antigen. The mean counts per minute (CPM) of iodinated anti-rabies gamma globulin coupled IgM rabies antibody in CSF and serum from rabid dogs were significantly higher than in CSF and serum from non-rabid dogs. Mean CPM from rabid dogs was greater in CSF than in sera, in contrast with non-rabid dogs, from which mean cpm was higher in sera than CSF, suggesting that antibody may have been synthesized in the CSF. To evaluate this test further, a dog was infected by rabies virus, and serial serum and CSF specimens were collected until the time of death. IgM anti-rabies antibody developed in the CSF and serum 29 days following infection, and rose just before the dog died of rabies on day 34. The rabies MAC RIA is potentially useful as a diagnostic method in quarantined dogs with rabies-like illness. Perhaps more importantly, it may be applied to better understand the immunopathogenicity of rabies.																					BCI:BCI198784015401	3576284

J	Haag, A; Wayss, K; Rommelaere, J; Cornelis, JJ								Experimentally induced infection with autonomous parvoviruses, minute virus of mice and H-1, in the African multimammate mouse (Mastomys coucha)								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				50	6			613	621						DEC 2000	2000	To determine whether the multimammate mouse (Mastomys coucha) could be used to evaluate rodent parvovirus-based vectors, neonates were subcutaneously inoculated with minute virus of mice (prototype strain, MVMp) or rat parvovirus H-1, The course of infection with both viruses was similar, Seroconversion occurred within two weeks after virus inoculation, as detected by use of hemagglutination-inhibition assays, and antibody titers remained high for the entire observation period of 12 months. Viral DNA and infective virions were detected in several organs of inoculated animals prior to seroconversion, as measured by use of Southern blotting and plaque assays, respectively. Infective particles subsequently became undetectable, whereas viral DNA imprints persisted in distinct organs for at least nine months. Clinical signs of parvovirus infection appeared around six weeks after virus inoculation, and consisted of hemorrhages, stunted growth, and transient hair color changes. Sudden death occurred in a significant fraction of animals infected with MVMp, but not H-1 virus, at the time of weaning. Altogether, MVMp, which is innocuous to its natural host, the mouse, and H-1 virus, which is poorly pathogenic to the rat, appear to be pathogenic for Mastomys coucha.

In vitro, the compound was more potent than ACV against wild-type clinical and laboratory HSV-1 strains and ACV(r) HSV isolates, as determined by a standard plaque reduction assay, with a mean 50% effective concentration of about 0.15 muM. The oral bioavailability of BILS 45 BS in hairless mice was 49%, with a peak concentration in plasma of 31.5 muM after administration of a single dose of 25 mg/kg. Following cutaneous infection of nude mice, both the HSV-1 dlsptk and PAA(r)5 mutant strains induced significant, reproducible, and persistent cutaneous lesions that lasted for more than 2 weeks. Oral treatment with ACV (100 or 125 mg/kg/day, three times a day by gavage) did not affect either mutant-induced infection. In contrast, BILS 45 BS at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg/day almost completely abolished cutaneous lesions mediated by both ACV(r) HSV-1 mutants. The 50% effective doses of BILS 45 BS were 56.7 and 61 mg/kg/day against dlsptk- and PAA(r)5-induced infections, respectively. Taken together, our results demonstrate very effective oral therapy of experimental ACV(r) HSV-1 infections in nude mice and support the potential use of HSV helicase-primase inhibitors for the treatment of nucleoside-resistant HSV disease in humans.

Characterization of Epitope-Specific Anti-Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Anti-RSV) Antibody Responses after Natural Infection and after Vaccination with Formalin-Inactivated RSV								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				90	13			5965	5977		10.1128/JVI.00235-16				JUL 2016	2016	Antibodies against the fusion (F) protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) play an important role in the protective immune response to this important respiratory virus. Little is known, however, about antibody levels against multiple F-specific epitopes induced by infection or after vaccination against RSV, while this is important to guide the evaluation of (novel) vaccines. In this study, we analyzed antibody levels against RSV proteins and F-specific epitopes in human sera and in sera of vaccinated and experimentally infected cotton rats and the correlation thereof with virus neutralization. Analysis of human sera revealed substantial diversity in antibody levels against F-, G(attachment)-, and F-specific epitopes between individuals. The highest correlation with virus neutralization was observed for antibodies recognizing prefusion-specific antigenic site empty set. Nevertheless, our results indicate that high levels of antibodies targeting other parts of the F protein can also mediate a potent antiviral antibody response. In agreement, sera of experimentally infected cotton rats contained high neutralizing activity despite lacking antigenic site empty set-specific antibodies. Strikingly, vaccination with formalin-inactivated RSV (FI-RSV) exclusively resulted in the induction of poorly neutralizing antibodies against postfusion-specific antigenic site I, although antigenic sites I, II, and IV were efficiently displayed in FI-RSV. The apparent immunodominance of antigenic site I in FI-RSV likely explains the low levels of neutralizing antibodies upon vaccination and challenge and may play a role in the vaccination-induced enhancement of disease observed with such preparations.IMPORTANCERSV is an importance cause of hospitalization of infants. The development of a vaccine against RSV has been hampered by the disastrous results obtained with FI-RSV vaccine preparations in the 1960s that resulted in vaccination-induced enhancement of disease. To get a better understanding of the antibody repertoire induced after infection or after vaccination against RSV, we investigated antibody levels against fusion (F) protein, attachment (G) protein, and F-specific epitopes in human and animal sera. The results indicate the importance of prefusion-specific antigenic site empty set antibodies as well as of antibodies targeting other epitopes in virus neutralization. However, vaccination of cotton rats with FI-RSV specifically resulted in the induction of weakly neutralizing, antigenic site I-specific antibodies, which may play a role in the enhancement of disease observed after vaccination with such preparations.

These fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector, respectively. 5'PCR fragment was digested by enzymes of Aat II and BssH II, and the Aat II - BssH II -digested 5'PCR fragment was obtained and cloned into the recombinant pGEM-T Easy vector containing 3'PCR fragment, the recombinant plasmid encoding full-length cDNA of SVDV HK'1/70 strain was then obtained and sequenced. The results showed that the complete genome of HK'1/70 was 7401 nucleotides (nts) long (excluding the poly (A) tract) which encodes a single polyprotein of 2185 amino acids, a 5'untranslating region (UTR) of 743 nts, a 3'UTR of 102 nts and a poly (A) tail at least 74 adenines. T7 promoter was added at the 5'end of the full-length cDNA and an additional Psp1406I restriction site was added at the 3'end of poly (A) tail. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences were compared and phylogenetic analysis was used to examine the evolutionary relationships. The results showed that HK'1/70 belonged to the second antigenic group. SVD virus was antigenically closely related to Coxsackie B5 virus, and located on the branches of CB5 evolutionary tree. Successful construction of full-length cDNA clone of SVDV HK'1/70 strain lays foundation for rescuing SVDV effectively and enables further research of SVDV on molecular level.

Unlike poliovirus, EV71 is often associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Here we established three mouse models for experimental infection with the same clinical isolate of EV71. The NOD/SCID mouse model is unique for the development of skin rash, an HFMD-like symptom. While the NOD/SCID mice developed limb paralysis and death at near-100% efficiency, the gamma interferon receptor knockout (ifngr KO) and stat-1 knockout mice exhibited paralysis and death rates near 78% and 30%, respectively. Productive infection with EV71 depends on the viral dose, host age, and inoculation route. Levels of infectious EV71, and levels of VP1-specific RNA and protein in muscle, brain, and spinal cord, were compared side by side between the NOD/SCID and stat-1 knockout models before, during, and after disease onset. Spleen fibrosis and muscle degeneration are common in the NOD/SCID and stat-1 knockout models. The main differences between these two models include their disease manifestations and cytokine/chemokine profiles. The pathology of the NOD/SCID model includes (i) inflammation and expression of viral VP1 antigen in muscle, (ii) increased neutrophil levels and decreased eosinophil and lymphocyte levels, and (iii) hair loss and skin rash. The characteristic pathology of the stat-1 knockout model includes (i) a strong tropism of EV71 for the central nervous system, (ii) detection of VP1 protein in the Purkinje layer of cerebellar cortex, pons, brain stem, and spinal cord, (iii) amplification of microglial cells, and (iv) dystrophy of intestinal villi. Our comparative studies on these new models with oral or intraperitoneal (i. p.) infection underscored the contribution of host immunity, including the gamma interferon receptor, to EV71 pathogenesis.IMPORTANCEIn the past decade, enterovirus 71 (EV71) has emerged as a major threat to public health in the Asia-Pacific region. Disease manifestations include subclinical infection, common-cold-like syndromes, hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD), uncomplicated brain stem encephalitis, severe dysregulation of the autonomic nerve system, fatal pulmonary edema, and cardiopulmonary collapse. To date, no effective vaccine or treatment is available. A user-friendly and widely accessible animal model for researching EV71 infection and pathogenesis is urgently needed by the global community, both in academia and in industry.

Manufacturing processes for the biologicals using bovine materials have the risk of viral contamination. Therefore viral validation is essential in ensuring the safety of the products. Bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1) is the most common bovine pathogen found in bovine blood, cell, tissue, and organ. In order to establish the validation system for the BHV-1 safety of the products, a real-time PCRmethod was developed for quantitative detection of BHV-1 in raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products as well as BHV-1 clearance validation. Specific primers for amplification of BHV-1 DNA was selected, and BHV-1 DNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green I. The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 2 TCID50/ml. The real-time PCR method was validated to be reproducible and very specific to BHV-1. The established real-time PCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with BHV-1. BHV-1 DNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culturesupernatant. Also the real-time PCR assay could detect 10 TCID50/ml of BHV-1 artificially contaminated in bovine collagen. The overall results indicated that this rapid, specific, sensitive, and robust assay can be reliably used for quantitative detection of BHV-1 contamination during the manufacture of biologics.				소의혈액, 세포, 조직, 기관등은생물의약품과조직공학제제, 세포치료제의원료로널리사용되고있다. 소유래 물질을원료로사용한제제의경우소유래원료물질에다양한바이러스가오염된사례가있기때문에바이러스 안전성검증이필수적이다.

The causative agent, the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), circulates between ticks and a variety of mammalian hosts. To study the interaction between TBEV and one of its suspected reservoir hosts, bank voles of the Western evolutionary lineage were inoculated subcutaneously with either one of eight TBEV strains or the related attenuated Langat virus, and were euthanized after 28 days. In addition, a subset of four strains was characterized in bank voles of the Carpathian linage. Six bank voles were inoculated per strain, and were housed together in groups of three with one uninfected in-contact animal each. Generally, most bank voles did not show any clinical signs over the course of infection. However, one infected bank vole died and three had to be euthanized prematurely, all of which had been inoculated with the identical TBEV strain (Battaune 17-H9, isolated in 2017 in Germany from a bank vole). All inoculated animals seroconverted, while none of the in-contact animals did. Viral RNA was detected via real-time RT-PCR in the whole blood samples of 31 out of 74 inoculated and surviving bank voles. The corresponding serum sample remained PCR-negative in nearly all cases (29/31). In addition, brain and/or spine samples tested positive in 11 cases, mostly correlating with a positive whole blood sample. Our findings suggest a good adaption of TBEV to bank voles, combining in most cases a low virulence phenotype with detectable virus replication and hinting at a reservoir host function of bank voles for TBEV.

As an important initiate in the inflammation, mast cells (MCs) play a critical role in maintaining a healthy physiology. However, the function of the MCs in the acute hepatitis caused by HEV is still unclear. In the present study, mongolian gerbils infected by HEV were used as an animal model to evaluate the role of MCs in the HEV infection. The positive ELISA and RT-PCR results showed the gerbils was successfully infected with HEV. The number of mast cell in the liver and the small intestine in the infected animals were growing higher significantly than the control group. In addition, higher expression of the tryptase and 5-HT in the liver and the intestine detected by immunohistochemical method and western blot also indicate the activation of MCs in the infection. These results suggest that MCs play an important role in the hepatitis E.																					WOS:000446070900001	30333798

Loss of Fas/Apo-1 receptor leads in (lpr;lpr) mice to a nonmalignant accumulation of abnormal T-cells very probably due to the lack of induction of apoptosis in peripheral T-cells. It has been reported that soluble forms of Fas/Apo-1 receptor that may interfere with apoptotic signaling occur in patients suffering from various forms of lymphoid neoplasms. Therefore, we wished to investigate whether the loss of proper homeostatic regulation through Fas/Apo-1 receptor mediated apoptosis could influence the process of lymphomagenesis, To this end, we performed two experiments (i) we infected (lpr,lpr) animals with Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMuLV) that causes T-cell lymphoma in mice and (ii) we crossed (lpr,lpr) animals with E mu L-myc transgenic mice that are prone to develop T- and B-cell lymphoma due to deregulated expression of the L-myc transgene by the immunoglobulin enhancer E mu. We find that infection with MoMuLV did not accelerate the formation of lymphoid neoplasms in (lpr,lpr) mice when compared to infected normal animals. However, E mu L-myc/(lpr,lpr) animals that constitutively express the L-myc transgene in the lymphoid lineage clearly show accelerated formation of T- and B-cell lymphoma when compared to normal E mu L-myc transgenics. These data demonstrate that in cooperation with particular oncogenes impairment of Fas/Apo-1 receptor function can indeed affect and modulate the process of tumor formation.

The difficulties involved in RSV vaccine development were recognized in an early vaccine trial, when children immunized with a formalin-inactivated virus preparation experienced enhanced illness after natural infection. Subsequent research in animal models has shown that the vaccine-enhanced disease is mediated at least in part by memory cells producing Th2 cytokines. Previously we had observed enhanced, eosinophilic lung pathology during primary infection of IFN-deficient STAT1(-/-) mice that are incapable of generating Th1 CD4(+) cells. To determine whether these effects depended only on Th2 cytokine secretion or involved other aspects of IFN signaling, we infected a series of 129SvEv knockout mice lacking the IFN-alpha beta R (IFN-alpha beta R-/-), the IFN-gamma R (IFN-gamma R-/-), or both receptors (IFN-alpha beta gamma R-/-). Although both the IFN-gamma R-/- and the IFN-alpha beta gamma R-/- animals generated strong Th2 responses to RSV-F protein epitopes, predominantly eosinophilic lung disease was limited to mice lacking both IFNRs. Although the absolute numbers of eosinophils in BAL fluids were similar between the strains, very few CD8(+) T cells could be detected in lungs of IFN-alpha beta gamma R-/- animals, leaving eosinophils as the predominant leukocyte. Thus, although CD4(+) Th2 cell differentiation is necessary for the development of allergic-type inflammation after infection and appears to be unaffected by type I IFNs, innate IFNs clearly have an important role in determining the nature and severity of RSV disease.

COMPARISON BETWEEN NEW BORN AND ADULT C-57BL-6 MICE								Journal of General Virology				60	1			24	30						1982	1982	Adult C57BL/6 mice are relatively resistant to i.p. infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Newborn mice of the strain C57BL/6 are highly susceptible to i.p. infection with HSV-1. Newborn C57BL/6 mice, in contrast to adult mice, did not develop natural killer cell activity in the peritoneal cavity 24 h after i.p. injection of HSV-1, and showed only minimal titers of interferon in the peritoneal fluid after 4 h. After 24 h the peritoneal fluid of newborn mice contained high amounts of interferon and high titers of HSV-1. The virus titers in the peritoneal cavity of adult mice were significantly lower. The early titers of interferon at the infection site that are observed in adult, resistant C57BL/6 mice but not in susceptible, newborn mice apparently play a decisive role in resistance.

Gut metabolite S-equol ameliorates hyperexcitability in entorhinal cortex neurons following Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced acute seizures								EPILEPSIA				62	8			1829	1841		10.1111/epi.16979		JUL 2021		AUG 2021	2021	Objective A growing body of evidence indicates a potential role for the gut-brain axis as a novel therapeutic target in treating seizures. The present study sought to characterize the gut microbiome in Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced seizures, and to evaluate the effect of microbial metabolite S-equol on neuronal physiology as well as TMEV-induced neuronal hyperexcitability ex vivo. Methods We infected C57BL/6J mice with TMEV and monitored the development of acute behavioral seizures 0-7 days postinfection (dpi). Fecal samples were collected at 5-7 dpi and processed for 16S sequencing, and bioinformatics were performed with QIIME2. Finally, we conducted whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in cortical neurons to investigate the effect of exogenous S-equol on cell intrinsic properties and neuronal hyperexcitability. Results We demonstrated that gut microbiota diversity is significantly altered in TMEV-infected mice at 5-7 dpi, exhibiting separation in beta diversity in TMEV-infected mice dependent on seizure phenotype, and lower abundance of genus Allobaculum in TMEV-infected mice regardless of seizure phenotype. In contrast, we identified specific loss of S-equol-producing genus Adlercreutzia as a microbial hallmark of seizure phenotype following TMEV infection. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that exogenous S-equol alters cortical neuronal physiology. We found that entorhinal cortex neurons are hyperexcitable in TMEV-infected mice, and exogenous application of microbial-derived S-equol ameliorated this TMEV-induced hyperexcitability. Significance Our study presents the first evidence of microbial-derived metabolite S-equol as a potential mechanism for alteration of TMEV-induced neuronal excitability. These findings provide new insight for the novel role of S-equol and the gut-brain axis in epilepsy treatment.																					WOS:000668841200001	34212377

A novel lineage transcription factor based analysis reveals differences in T helper cell subpopulation development in infected and intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) piglets								DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY				46	2			333	340		10.1016/j.dci.2014.05.005				OCT 2014	2014	Research in mouse and human clearly identified subsets of T helper (Th) cells based on nuclear expression of specific lineage transcription factors. In swine, however, transcription factor based detection of functional subpopulations of porcine Th cells by flow cytometry is so far limited to regulatory T cells via Foxp3.T-bet and GATA-3 are the transcription factors that regulate commitment to Th1 or Th2 cells, respectively. In this study we prove GATA-3 and T-bet expression in porcine CD4(+) cells polarized in vitro. Importantly, GATA-3 and T-bet expressing cells were detectable in pigs infected with pathogens associated with Th2 and Th1 immune responses. Increased frequencies of GATA-3 positive CD4(+) cells are found in vivo in pigs experimentally infected with the nematode Trichuris suis, whereas porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection elicited T-bet positive CD4(+) T cells.Analysing the immune status of pre-weaning piglets with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) we found an increased expression of Foxp3, T-bet and GATA-3 in CD4(+) and CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive T cells in systemic and intestinal compartments of IUGR piglets. Hence, we established the detection of porcine Th1 and Th2 cells via T-bet and GATA-3 and show that the porcine lineage transcription factors are differentially regulated very early in life depending on the developmental status.

The clones producing MAb were selected to be specific for BHV-1.3 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only L1B neutralized virus without complement. With the addition of complement, five of the MAb neutralized BHV-1.3 but not the respiratory strain BHV-1.1. The anti-BHV-1.3-specific MAb Q10B, L6G, and L1B precipitated glycoproteins from BHV-1.3 that were analogous to the gI, gIII, and gIV glycoproteins of BHV-1.1, respectively. The other four MAb precipitated unknown proteins. None of the anti-BHV-1.3 MAb precipitated BHV-1.1 glycoproteins. The majority of the anti-BHV-1.3 MAb did not react with BHV-1.1 by immunoblotting, but O7E (unknown protein pattern by radioimmunoprecipitation) was reactive with five proteins (M(r)s of 33,000, 43,000, 70,000, 141,000, and 190,000) of BHV-1.3 and with a different pattern of proteins of BHV-1.1 (M(r)s of 30,000, 38,000, 83,000, and 144,000). Two of the MAb, L6G and O7E, conjugated with peroxidase were found to be useful for detecting BHV-1.3 antigen by immunochemistry in Formalin-fixed brain tissue from experimentally infected calves.

Laboratory control results of inactivated vaccine immunogenicity against rhinopneumonia and Salmonella equine abortion.								Russian Agricultural Sciences				42	5			378	380		10.3103/S106836741605013X				2016	2016	Laboratory control of immunogenicity in linear and outbred white mice of the experimental sample of the inactivated vaccine against rhinopneumonia and Salmonella equine abortion was carried out. The associated vaccine protects against experimental infection by rhinopneumonia virus 87.5% of the immunized animals and against the injection of the Salmonella abortion pathogen 100% of the immunized animals. Sufficiently high immunogenicity of the inactivated vaccine against rhinopneumonia and Salmonella abortion is due to antigenic activity that provides synthesis of specific antibodies in high titers and immunomodulatory agents that stimulate immunobiological reactivity of the organism.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				36	6			423	426						2014	2014	To investigate the prevalence of H3 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) in China, two AIVs (HuB/176/12 and FJ/134/11) of H3N2 subtype were isolated from live-poultry markets during 2011 to 2012. The sequencing results showed that both isolates had a HA cleavage site of 339PEKQTR GLFG348, which was a characteristic of low pathogenesis AIV, and internal genes were highly homologous to H1, H2, H5, H6, H7, H9 and H12 subtype, respectively. In addition, the pathogenetic test showed that the HuB/176/12 was able to shedding through the respiratory only, but the FJ/134/11 AIV shedding through the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In addition, the isolates had the ability to spread among chickens and the virus was restricted replication in trachea, kidney, fabricius, appendix and lung in the infected chickens. Experimental infection tests showed that the isolates were both low-pathogenic for mice which were only replicated in nasal shall and lung and caused a slight histopathogical lesions.

Adjuvant activity of multimolecular complexes based on Glycyrrhiza glabra saponins, lipids, and influenza virus glycoproteins								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				164	7			1793	1803		10.1007/s00705-019-04273-2				JUL 2019	2019	Numerous studies have shown that immunostimulatory complexes containing Quil-A saponin and various antigens are effective in stimulating the immune response and can be used as vaccine preparations for animals and humans. However, Quil-A saponin possesses toxicity and haemolytic activity. In the present work, a saponin-containing preparation named Glabilox was isolated from the roots of a Glycyrrhiza glabra L. plant by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results showed that Glabilox has no toxicity or haemolytic activity and can form stable immunostimulatory complexes. Subcutaneous immunization of mice with an immunostimulating complex containing Glabilox and H7N1 influenza virus antigens stimulated high levels of humoral and cellular immunity. Vaccination of chickens with the same immunostimulating complex protected 100% of the animals after experimental infection with a homologous virus. Comparative studies showed that the immunogenic and protective activity of immunostimulatory complexes containing Quil-A and immunostimulatory complexes containing Glabilox are comparable to each other. The results of these studies indicated that Glycyrrhiza glabra saponins show great promise as safe and effective adjuvants.																					WOS:000470820500006	31079211

Innate and adaptive immunity in wild rodents spontaneously and experimentally infected with the tick-borne encephalitis virus.								Infection Genetics and Evolution				80				1	6						Jun 2020	2020	Two dominant species of wild small rodents trapped in Novosibirsk region, South-Western Siberia, Russia differed in their susceptibility to the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection. TBEV RNA average detection rate for Northern red-backed vole Myodes rutilus (Pallas, 1779) (82.2 [plus or minus] 5.8% blood samples and 63.1 [plus or minus] 2.7% organ samples) significantly exceeded the corresponding values for the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius (Pallas, 1771) (47.0 [plus or minus] 8.7% blood and 24.5 [plus or minus] 2.8% organ samples) (p < 0.001). Innate immunity may be one of possible reasons of the differences. Thl cytokine gene expression distinguished between M. rutilus (12.5 [plus or minus] 8.5%) and A. agrarius (66.6 [plus or minus] 11.4%), whereas Th2 cytokine frequencies were statistically similar (81.8 [plus or minus] 12.2% and 100.0%, respectively). Polarization indexes (PI) of the innate immunity calculated as ratio of Th2 to Thl cytokine RNA detection rates for both M. rutilus (6.5) and A. agrarius (1.5) suggested Th2 mainly humoral immune response against persistent TBEV in natural mammalian hosts. Therefore, the TBEV-induced antibodies were analyzed by ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests. The TBEV-specific antibodies were detected in 74.8 [plus or minus] 4.3% sera of M. rutilus and 67.3 [plus or minus] 6.8% of A. agrarius. Among them HI antibodies were found in 4.8 [plus or minus] 2.1% of the same analyzed sera of M. rutilus and in 6.0 [plus or minus] 3.4% blood samples of A. agrarius only. To model the TBEV persistence both M. rutilus and A. agrarius were infected with the suspensions of the TBEVinfected ticks with further observations during 4 subsequent months. Detection rate of the TBEV RNA and antigen E remained high during the whole period, however, pathogenic for laboratory suckling mice virus was isolated up to 8 days postinfection. At late stages of the persistent infection (1-4 months) the TBEV RNA detection rate in northern red-backed voles remained high 70.6 [plus or minus] 7.9% whereas in striped field mice significantly declined to 26.7 [plus or minus] 9.2% (p < .001). Comparative analysis of the innate immunity of the wild rodents in 2 months postinfection showed similar frequencies of Th2 cytokine gene expression for M. rutilus (77.8 [plus or minus] 10.1%) and A. agrarius (71.4 [plus or minus] 12.5%) (p > .05) but Thl cytokine mRNA detection rates were different (44.4 [plus or minus] 12.5% and 85.7 [plus or minus] 9.7%, respectively) (p < .05). In 2 months PI decreased from 6.5 until 1.75 for M. rutilus and from 1.5 until 0.83 for A. agrarius. Nevertheless, Th2 mainly humoral immune response was confirmed by direct detection of the TBEV-specific antibodies. HI and neutralizing antibodies were revealed in blood sera of the small rodents of both studied species in 30 days postinfection and remained at detectable levels during 4 months of observations. Accordingly, Th2 polarized innate immunity of small rodents might facilitate the TBEV intracellular persistence in the presence of HI and neutralization antibodies.

Although a fairly large number of drugs are used to control these infections, the development and implementation of effective therapeutic agents remains an urgent task. Authors studied the therapeutic and prophylactic effcacy of Gamapren (GP), the active ingredient of which is phosphorylated polyprenols isolated from mulberry leaves, in various variants of experimental infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in mice. Strains VR-3 and L2 of the HSV-1 were used. Experiments were carried out on outbred white mice weighing 7-8 and 10-12 g. Commercial preparation GP was used in a dose of 20 g per mouse. Commercial preparation Ridostin was used as a comparison medication. The model of experimental herpetic meningoencephalitis was created in mice weighing 7-8 g following intracerebral inoculation with 0.03 ml of material containing 10 LD50 HSV-1. GP effcacy was estimated by increase in survival rate and average life expectancy of the mice in experimental group compared with control group. The model of experimental herpes infection in mice was reproduced in mice weighing 10-12 g. For infection HSV-1 strain L2 was used with the titer 7 lg LD50/0,03 ml. Authors also estimated antiviral effcacy of GP inoculated before emergence of the frst clinical signs of the disease and at the stage of infection with clinically expressed signs of the disease. Antiviral effcacy of GP was revealed both in model of experimental herpetic meningoencephalitis, and in mice infected with HSV-1 before emergence of the frst clinical signs of the disease and at the stage of infection with clinically expressed signs of the disease.			Таким образом, препарат Гамапрен в экспериментальном исследовании на мышах проявил выраженную антивирусную активность в отношении различных форм инфекции, вызванной ВПГ-1. Наибольшая эффективность препарата выявлена при введении согласно профилактической и лечебно-профилактической схемам.																		RSCI:35209274

Neurobiology of disease				1	3			111	9		10.1006/nbdi.1994.0014				1994-Dec	1994	Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) is a hyperkinetic movement disorder caused by chronic treatment of psychiatric patients with dopamine (DA) receptor blocking drugs (Stacy & Jankovic 1991). Although TD is one of the most important and frequently encountered iatrogenic disorders in clinical medicine, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. We have observed a hyperkinetic movement disorder in rats experimentally infected with a neurotropic RNA virus, Borna disease virus, that may provide important insights into the pathophysiology of TD. Like TD patients, infected rats show prominent orofacial dyskinesias. In keeping with the dopamine (Goetz & Klawans 1982) and anatomic (Fibiger & Lloyd 1984) hypotheses of TD, the Borna disease rat model shows enhanced behavioural sensitivity to DA agonists and selective striatal cell damage. There is also evidence of DA deafferentation and heterogeneous reduction of D2 binding in the caudate-putamen, particularly from sites implicated in oral behaviour. These observations on a virus-induced movement disorder offer novel approaches to TD pathogenesis.																					MEDLINE:9173990	9173990

We investigated whether influenza A virus infection promotes oropharyngeal colonization with S. pneumoniae and other middle ear pathogens by selectively inhibiting commensal bacteria. On study day 0, 12 allergic and 15 nonallergic adult subjects were intranasally inoculated with influenza A/Kawasaki (H1N1) virus, Every subject was infected with the virus as demonstrated by nasal shedding or seroconversion, Average upper respiratory symptom scores and nasal secretion weights from the entire subject group were elevated between days 2 and 6 (acute phase) and were not significantly different between allergic and nonallergic subjects. S. pneumoniae was not isolated from any subject prior to the virus challenge but was isolated in heavy density from 4 (15%) subjects on day 6 (P = 0.055). Staphylococcus aureus was isolated more frequently from the nonallergic subjects than from the allergic subjects on days 2 (80 versus 25%, respectively) 4, (67 versus 17%, respectively), and 6 (73 versus 25%, respectively) (P < 0.05). The isolation rates of other middle ear pathogens were not significantly different before virus challenge and during the acute and resolution phases (days 27 to 30) of the experimental infection for the entire subject group or either the allergic or nonallergic subgroup. Densities and isolation rates of commensal bacteria from the entire subject group were similar throughout the observational period. These results suggest that the virus infection promoted S. pneumoniae colonization of the oropharynx and that nonallergic persons may be more vulnerable to colonization with S. aureus than allergic persons. The altered colonization rates were not attributed to inhibition of commensal bacteria.																					WOS:A1995QP13400002	7890365

To address these issues, this study used the changes occurring in DC subpopulations during the experimental Infection by the Swiss (SW) strain of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). MMTV(SW) induced an 18-fold increase in lymph node DCs, which can be blocked by anti-CD62L treatment, concomitant with the presence of high numbers of DCs in the outer cortex, in close association with high endothelial venules. These data suggest that the DC increase caused by MMTV(SW) infection results from the recruitment of blood-borne DCs via high endothelial venules, by a CD62L-dependent mechanism. In addition, skin sensitization assays indicate that MMTV(SW) infection inhibits epidermal Langerhans cell migration to the draining lymph node. Moreover, data on the kinetics of MMTV(SW)-induced expansion of the different DC subsets support the hypothesis that CD8(-) and CD8(+) DCs represent different maturation stages of the same DC population, rather than myeloid- and lymphoid-derived DCs, respectively, as previously proposed.

Virological and pathomorphological aspects of experimental associated infections with parainfluenza virus, adenovirus and respiratory syncytial virus in the mouse								Romanian Journal of Virology				46	3-4			145	160						July-Dec., 1995	1995	Associated infections with long-strain parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus type 3 and respiratory syncytial virus were experimentally induced in white mice. They were pointed out by the appearance of homologous serum antibodies, positive IF reactions in the pulmonary tissue, and histological, histochemical and histoenzymatic lesions, which were more severe than those of controls infected with single virus of those mentioned above, since they involved wider areas and had a high frequency. The pathomorphological changes made up an inflammatory, exudative, alterative and predominantly infiltrative lymphohistiocytic picture, mainly pulmonary (diffuse interstitial bronchopneumonia, sometimes with a peribronchovascular location, of a cuff-like aspect), hepatic, renal and cardiac, but dystrophic processes were also present - hyalinosis of tunica media in the lung, hepatocyte cytoplasm vacuolizations on areas of various sizes of lobuli -, especially in associated infections with parainfluenza virus type 3 and adenovirus type 3. Megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the spleen, present in all the experimental models, was also described. Generally, the modified structural aspects made up and pointed out a complex pathological process.																					BCI:BCI199800406146	9179966

The authors accidentally isolated toxoplasms from two experimental mice. They showed that multiplication was only possible in the presence of living susceptible tissue; the organisms were cultivated on Li-Rivers medium and during the course of the work they increased in virulence. Details of the experimental infection in mice, g. pigs, rabbits and rhesus monkeys are given; in all except the last the infection was fatal. Toxoplasms appear to have characteristics common to other obligate cellular parasites such as the viruses.Rhesus monkeys recovered from toxoplasm infection were immune to reinocu-lation, and their serum contained neutralizing or protective antibodies. It was found possible to titrate such sera by means of intradermal tests on rabbits. Serum from recovered rhesus monkeys, when mixed with virulent toxoplasms, protected mice and rabbits, but when the toxoplasms present were washed free of serum they retained their infectivity; the serum appeared to have no effect on the toxoplasms in vitro.Before the change in virulence, rabbits recovered from an infection given intradermally, and such recovered rabbits possessed a solid immunity although having no demonstrable circulating antibodies. The authors assume that these animals had acquired a tissue immunity to the toxoplasms.																					CABI:19392201065

A human monoclonal antibody (hMAb; EM4C04), highly specific for the 2009 pH1N1 virus hemagglutinin (HA), was isolated from a severely ill 2009 pH1N1 virus-infected patient. We postulated that under immune pressure with EM4C04, the 2009 pH1N1 virus would undergo antigenic drift and mutate at sites that would identify the antibody binding site. To do so, we infected MDCK cells in the presence of EM4C04 and generated 11 escape mutants, displaying 7 distinct amino acid substitutions in the HA. Six substitutions greatly reduced MAb binding (K123N, D131E, K133T, G134S, K157N, and G158E). Residues 131, 133, and 134 are contiguous with residues 157 and 158 in the globular domain structure and contribute to a novel pH1N1 antibody epitope. One mutation near the receptor binding site, S186P, increased the binding affinity of the HA to the receptor. 186P and 131E are present in the highly virulent 1918 virus HA and were recently identified as virulence determinants in a mouse-passaged pH1N1 virus. We found that pH1N1 escape variants expressing these substitutions enhanced replication and lethality in mice compared to wild-type 2009 pH1N1 virus. The increased virulence of these viruses was associated with an increased affinity for alpha 2,3 sialic acid receptors. Our study demonstrates that antibody pressure by an hMAb targeting a novel epitope in the Sa region of 2009 pH1N1 HA is able to inadvertently drive the development of a more virulent virus with altered receptor binding properties. This broadens our understanding of antigenic drift.IMPORTANCE Influenza viruses accumulate amino acid substitutions to evade the antibody response in a process known as antigenic drift, making it necessary to vaccinate against influenza annually. Mapping human monoclonal antibody (hMAb) epitopes is a necessary step towards understanding antigenic drift in humans. We defined the specificity of an hMAb that specifically targeted the 2009 pH1N1 virus and describe a novel epitope. In addition, we identified a previously unappreciated potential for antibody escape to enhance the pathogenicity of a virus. The escape mutation that we identified with in vitro immune pressure was independently reported by other investigators using in vivo selection in nonimmune mice. Although in vitro generation of escape mutants is unlikely to recapitulate antigenic drift in its entirety, the data demonstrate that pressure by a human monoclonal antibody targeting a novel epitope in the hemagglutinin of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus can inadvertently drive the development of escape mutants, of which a subset have increased virulence and altered receptor binding properties.

J	Trifonova, Radiana T.; Bollman, Brooke; Barteneva, Natasha S.; Lieberman, Judy								Myeloid Cells in Intact Human Cervical Explants Capture HIV and Can Transmit It to CD4 T Cells								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				9						2719	10.3389/fimmu.2018.02719				NOV 23 2018	2018	The importance of myeloid cells in HIV transmission in the female genital tract is uncertain. Because it is difficult to study the early events in HIV transmission in humans, most of our knowledge is based on animal models of SIV infection in Rhesus macaques and more recently HIV infection in humanized mice. However, these models may not accurately recapitulate transmission in the human genital tract. CD14+ myeloid cells are the most abundant hematopoietic cells in the human cervical mucosa, comprising 40-50% of CD45+ mononuclear cells. Most CD14+ cells are CD14+CD11c- macrophages and about a third are CD14+CD11c+ tissue dendritic cells, which express the HIV-binding receptors, DC-SIGN and CX3CR1. To examine the role of mucosal myeloid cells in HIV transmission, we infected intact healthy human cervical explants with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 ex vivo and then sorted populations of cervical immune cells 20 h later to determine whether they took up virus and could transmit it to activated CD4 T cells. Viral RNA was detected in CD14+ myeloid cells in all but one of 10 donor tissue samples, even when HIV RNA was not detected in CD4+ T cells. HIV RNA was detected predominantly in CD14+CD11c+ dendritic cells rather than in CD14+CD11c- macrophages. The reverse transcriptase inhibitor, nevirapine, reduced HIV RNA in CD4+ T cells, but not in CD14+ cells. Moreover, integrated HIV DNA were not detected above background in myeloid cells but was detected in T cells. These data suggest that although HIV replicates in T cells, myeloid cells in the female genital mucosa capture viral particles, but do not replicate the virus at early timepoints. However, sorted CD14+ myeloid cells isolated 20 h post-infection from 5 HIV-infected cervical explants tested all transmitted HIV to activated CD4+ T cells, while only 1 sample of sorted CD4+ T cells did. Thus, myeloid cells in human cervical tissue capture HIV and are an important early cellular storage site of infectious virus.																					WOS:000451096300001	30532754

Kidneys of infected birds showed atrophy, signs of nephritis and ureters dilated with urates. The isolate gave positive precipitation reactions with infectious bronchitis virus immune serum. The virus was thermolablie at 56°C for 1 hour, was sensitive to chloroform, and failed to agglutinate chicken, horse, sheep or rat erythrocytes. Symptoms of the disease were reproduced in 30-to 60-day-old chicks experimentally infected with the virus, but day-old chicks were not susceptible to infection.

Multi-Organ Histopathological Changes in a Mouse Hepatitis Virus Model of COVID-19								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	9					1703	10.3390/v13091703				SEP 2021	2021	Infection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the global COVID-19 pandemic, causes a respiratory illness that can severely impact other organ systems and is possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, septic shock, thrombosis, and oxidative stress. SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals may be asymptomatic or may experience mild, moderate, or severe symptoms with or without pneumonia. The mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 infects humans are largely unknown. Mouse hepatitis virus 1 (MHV-1)-induced infection was used as a highly relevant surrogate animal model for this study. We further characterized this animal model and compared it with SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. MHV-1 inoculated mice displayed death as well as weight loss, as reported earlier. We showed that MHV-1-infected mice at days 7-8 exhibit severe lung inflammation, peribronchiolar interstitial infiltration, bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis and intra-alveolar necrotic debris, alveolar exudation (surrounding alveolar walls have capillaries that are dilated and filled with red blood cells), mononuclear cell infiltration, hyaline membrane formation, the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, and interstitial edema. When compared to uninfected mice, the infected mice showed severe liver vascular congestion, luminal thrombosis of portal and sinusoidal vessels, hepatocyte degeneration, cell necrosis, and hemorrhagic changes. Proximal and distal tubular necrosis, hemorrhage in interstitial tissue, and the vacuolation of renal tubules were observed. The heart showed severe interstitial edema, vascular congestion, and dilation, as well as red blood cell extravasation into the interstitium. Upon examination of the MHV-1 infected mice brain, we observed congested blood vessels, perivascular cavitation, cortical pericellular halos, vacuolation of neuropils, darkly stained nuclei, pyknotic nuclei, and associated vacuolation of the neuropil in the cortex, as well as acute eosinophilic necrosis and necrotic neurons with fragmented nuclei and vacuolation in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the widespread thrombotic events observed in the surrogate animal model for SARS-CoV-2 mimic the reported findings in SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, representing a highly relevant and safe animal model for the study of the pathophysiologic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 for potential therapeutic interventions.

A virulent isolate of yellow head nidovirus contains a deformed envelope glycoprotein gp116								VIROLOGY				384	1			192	200		10.1016/j.virol.2008.10.042				FEB 5 2009	2009	Yellow head virus (YHV) is a highly virulent pathogen of penaeid shrimp. An isolate obtained from Penaeus vannamei during a yellow head disease outbreak in February 2006 in Ratchaburi Province, Thailand was purified following passage in experimentally infected shrimp. SDS-PAGE of purified virions indicated that envelope glycoprotein gp116 in the Ratchaburi/2006 isolate was smaller and relatively less abundant than in the Chachoengsao/1998 YHV reference strain. The variant gp116 reacted poorly in immunoblots with a gp116 mouse monoclonal antibody and a rabbit anti-serum to a baculovirus-expressed. C-terminally truncated. [His](6)-tagged gp116 that reacted strongly with gp116 of the homologous Chachoengsao/1998 strain. The anti-gp116 polyclonal serum also failed to neutralise the infectivity of the Ratchaburi/2006 isolate in in-vivo assays conducted in P. vannamei, but effectively neutralised the infectivity of the reference strain. Sequence analysis of the similar to 6.0 kb structural protein gene region and 3'UTR of the Ratchaburi/2006 isolate indicated >99.9% overall nucleotide identity with the Chachoengsao/1998 strain. However, in Ratchaburi/2006 a deletion in ORF3, corresponding to 54 amino acids near the N-terminal signal peptidase cleavage site of gp116, resulted in the loss of six conserved cysteine residues and two predicted N-glycosylation sites. Analysis of this ORF3 region in 25 viruses representing each of the six genotypes in the yellow head complex identified this modified form of gp116 in two other virulent YHV isolates classified as genotype 1b. The data indicate that, although the deletion causes a significant structural deformation of gp116 which reduces its incorporation into virions and eliminates the major neutralisation sites, the virus remains highly infectious, virulent and fit for survival.

However, it is unknown how and in which way influenza infection affects stroke outcome.Methods-We infected mice intranasally with human influenza A (H1N1) virus and occluded the middle cerebral artery to induce ischemic strokes. Infarct volume and intracerebral hemorrhage were determined by histology. To evaluate the integrity of the blood-brain barrier and inflammation, we measured various cytokines in vivo and in vitro and performed immunohistochemistry of leukocyte markers, collagen IV, immunoglobulins, and matrix metalloproteinase-9.Results-Influenza virus infection increased infarct size. Whereas changes in cardiovascular parameters did not explain this effect, we found evidence for an inflammatory mechanism. In influenza virus infection, the respiratory tract released cytokines into the blood, such as RANTES that induced macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and other inflammatory mediators in the ischemic brain. In infected mice, there was an increased number of neutrophils expressing the matrix metalloproteinase-9 in the ischemic brain. This was accompanied by severe disruption of the blood-brain barrier and an increased rate of intracerebral hemorrhages after tissue plasminogen activator treatment. To investigate the role of cytokines, we blocked cytokine release by using GTS-21, a selective agonist of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. GTS-21 ameliorated ischemic brain damage and improved survival.Conclusions-Influenza virus infection triggers a cytokine cascade that aggravates ischemic brain damage and increases the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage after tissue plasminogen activator treatment. Blockade of cytokine production by alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists is a novel therapeutic option to treat stroke in a proinflammatory context.

In one int-2 transgenic line (TG,NX), this growth disturbance is evoked by pregnancy and regresses after parturition. Regression of hyperplastic mammary epithelium is less complete after successive pregnancies, and, within 10 months, most TG.NX mice stochastically develop mammary carcinomas that are transplantable in virgin, syngeneic mice. To identify genes that cooperate with int-2 in cell transformation, we infected TG,NX transgenic mice with MMTV. In a cohort of 14 animals, most mammary tumors represented clonal or oligoclonal outgrowths harboring one to five proviral MMTV integrants. Eight of 35 (23%) MMTV(+) tumors exhibited proviral insertion at the Wnt-1 locus. No provirus was detected at the int-2, int-3, or Wnt-3 loci. By Southern analysis, two tumors had proviral insertions at the same genomic location, which was mapped to chromosome 15. Cloning of this int locus identified an additional member of the Wnt gene family. The predicted 389-amino acid protein is most closely related to zebrafish Wnt-10a (58% amino acid identity over 362 residues) and, based on homology analysis, was designated Wnt-10b. This newly discovered Wnt family member was expressed in the embryo and mammary gland of virgin but not pregnant mice candidate collaborating oncogene of int-2/Fgf-3 in the mammary epithelium.

Swine influenza was induced in pigs by intranasal instillation of material from spontaneous epizootic cases in eastern Iowa. The experimental disease had the same features as the epizootic. It was maintained for study by serial passages. The principal pathological features are exudative bronchitis accompanied by marked damage of the bronchial epithelium and its cilia, peribronchial round-cell infiltration, and massive pulmonary atelectasis. The latter is modified by round-cell infiltration of the alveolar walls. The lymph nodes (especially the cervical and mediastinal) are hyperplastic and edematous. Acute splenic tumor usually occurs. The mucosa of the stomach and colon is congested. Pneumonia following swine influenza is, characteristically, lobular in type and of the same general distribution as the atelectasis. The non-pneumonic areas of the lung are extremely edematous and congested. II. A hemophilia bacillus was regularly cultured from the respiratory tract of a series of swine experimentally infected, and from a small number of spontaneous field cases. It was not observed in respiratory-tract cultures from a group of swine free from influenza. Its cultural and morphological characters are described and the name Hemophilus influenzae var. suis* (p.364) is suggested. It exhibits marked serological diversity since only 2 of 8 strains studied were serologically identical. It is usually non-pathogenic for rabbits and white rats, and irregularly pathogenic for white mice. 1 strain was pathogenic for guinea pigs; 2 others were not. 11 of 13 attempts to induce symptoms of disease in swine by intranasal inoculation with pure cultures were negative. Attention is called to the marked similarity between non-indol-producing strains of H. influenzae and H. influenzae suis.[long dash]III. In Berkefeld filtrates of infectious material from experimental cases, a virus was demonstrated which, when administered intranasally into susceptible swine, induced a mild, usually afebrile illness of short duration. Respiratory-tract changes resembled those in swine influenza, but were less extensive. When the filterable virus was mixed with pure cultures of H. influenzae suis and administered to swine, a disease identical clinically and pathologically with swine influenza was induced. The data indicate that this filterable virus and H. influenzae suis act in concert to produce swine influenza, and that neither alone is capable of inducing the disease. One attack usually renders an animal immune to reinfection. Blood serum from an animal made immune in this way neutralizes infectious material from swine influenza in vitro, as shown by failure of the mixture to produce disease in a susceptible animal. The virus can be stored in a dried state or in glycerol for several wks. In one instance, dried material apparently retained both the virus and H. influenzae suis in viable form for 54 days. Fatal experimental cases were observed, in which H. influenzae suis was the only organism that could be cultivated from the respiratory tract. Attention is called to some features of marked similarity between epizootic swine influenza and epidemic influenza in man. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19340800013797	19869922

CROSS-PROTECTIVE PROPERTIES OF AN INFLUENZA VACCINE BASED ON HBc4M2e RECOMBINANT PROTEIN								Voprosy Virusologii				63	2			68	76		10.18821/0507-4088-2018-63-2-68-76				2018	2018	One of the main problems in the area of influenza prophylaxis and pandemic prevention is the development of cross-reactive vaccines, i.e. vaccines directed against all subtypes of human influenza viruses. Such vaccines are being developed in many countries for more than 10 years. A number of vaccines are presently undergoing clinical trials. We created Uniflu candidate vaccine based on recombinant HBc4M2e protein consisting of 4 tandem-connected copies of the highly conserved ectodomain of M2 protein of the influenza A virus. These 4 copies were genetically fused to the carrier protein, namely hepatitis B core antigen. Commercially available Derinat was used as adjuvant in the candidate vaccine. Preclinical studies on laboratory animals (mice, ferrets) demonstrated that immunization with Uniflu leads to significantly higher level of specific immunoglobulins in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavages. Moreover, it produces immunoglobulins belonging to subtype IgG2a that is the most important mediator of antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. The vaccine under review stimulates the proliferation of T-lymphocytes, as well as the formation of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells synthesizing gamma-IFN- When infected with the lethal doses (5 LD50) of influenza A viruses of the subtypes H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and H1N1pdm09, immunized animals typically developed mild form of illness. This kept them alive in 90-100% of cases, which demonstrated almost complete protection from death. Replication of the virus in the lungs of immunized mice was reduced by 1.8-4.8 log10. High immunogenicity of the vaccine, and reduced clinical symptoms following experimental infection, were demonstrated in ferrets as well. The developed recombinant vaccine Uniflu has high specific activity and cross-protection. Uniflu can be proposed as pre-pandemic vaccine, provided that it passes clinical trials.

When primary cell monolayers derived from kidney tissue of convalescent g.pigs after experimental infection with virus type A22, and from that of uninfected g.pigs, were inoculated with type A22 at multiplicity of one TCID50, the development of cytopathic effect (CPE) occurred 24 hours later in cell cultures from convalescent g.pigs and about 20% of the cells appeared to be resistant to FMD virus. All serially propagated cell cultures showed extensive CPE when inoculated with type A7 or A22 at multiplicity of 1 to 2 TCID50, but some cells in each inoculated culture survived infection. Such cells were cultured and studied at cell passage 1 to 20 levels for susceptibility to challenge with homologous and heterologous virus types. All cell cultures showed marked CPE after challenge with heterologous virus, while none of the cultures challenged with homologous virus was visibly affected up to the tenth cell passage level. This resistance to homologous virus was genetically mediated.																					CABI:19722269209

A total of 38 out of 229 (16.59%; 95% CI = 12.00%-22.10%) fecal samples from Tibetan pigs from the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau in 2018 were positive for HEV RNA, which was detected by RT-nPCR. Significantly different detection rates were observed between samples from diarrheic and clinically healthy animals (OR = 9.56; 95% CI, 2.84-32.14; p < 0.001), suggesting a potential association between HEV infection and diarrhea in Tibetan pigs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HEV isolates were clustered into subtypes 4a (31 samples), 4b (1), 4d (2), and 4j (4). HEV-4a was the predominant subtype, indicating that it might be circulating in Tibetan pigs. Nine complete HEV genome sequences obtained from Tibetan pigs were found by phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to those of genotype 4 HEV isolates from humans. Two recombinant events were identified in both HEV-4a strains; a novel recombination breakpoint was first identified at the 3' end of the ORF2 region in the SWU/L9/2018 strain, and a common recombination region was found at the junction of the ORF1 and ORF2 regions in the SWU/31-12/2018 strain. Furthermore, HEV-4a could be detected in all BALB/c mice that were experimentally infected by gavage and contact exposure. The information presented here about the prevalence and genotype diversity of HEV from Tibetan pigs provides important insights into the epidemic features of HEV on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

To better understand the causes of this heterogeneity, wild voles sampled in two adjacent NE endemic and non-endemic regions of France were infected experimentally with PUUV. The responses of bank voles to PUUV infection, based on the levels of anti-PUUV IgG and viral RNA, were compared. Slight regional differences were highlighted despite the high inter-individual variability. Voles from the NE non-endemic region showed greater immune responsiveness to PUUV infection, but lower levels of RNA in their organs than voles from the endemic region. These results suggest the existence of regional variations in the sensitivity of bank voles that could contribute to the apparent absence of PUUV circulation among voles and the absence of NE in the non endemic region.

EBioMedicine				75				103803	103803		10.1016/j.ebiom.2021.103803				2022-Jan	2022	BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been a great threat to global public health since 2020. Although the advance on vaccine development has been largely achieved, a strategy to alleviate immune overactivation in severe COVID-19 patients is still needed. The NLRP3 inflammasome is activated upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated with COVID-19 severity. However, the processes by which the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in COVID-19 disease remain unclear.METHODS: We infected THP-1 derived macrophages, NLRP3 knockout mice, and human ACE2 transgenic mice with live SARS-CoV-2 in Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory. We performed quantitative real-time PCR for targeted viral or host genes from SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse tissues, conducted histological or immunofluorescence analysis in SARS-CoV-2 infected mouse tissues. We also injected intranasally AAV-hACE2 or intraperitoneally NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor MCC950 before SARS-CoV-2 infection in mice as indicated.FINDINGS: We have provided multiple lines of evidence that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays an important role in the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the lungs. Inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome attenuated the release of COVID-19 related pro-inflammatory cytokines in cell cultures and mice. The severe pathology induced by SARS-CoV-2 in lung tissues was reduced in Nlrp3-/- mice compared to wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Finally, specific inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 alleviated excessive lung inflammation and thus COVID-19 like pathology in human ACE2 transgenic mice.INTERPRETATION: Inflammatory activation induced by SARS-CoV-2 is an important stimulator of COVID-19 related immunopathology. Targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome is a promising immune intervention against severe COVID-19 disease.FUNDING: This work was supported by grants from the Bureau of Frontier Sciences and Education, CAS (grant no.

J	Lai, Zetian; Zhou, Tengfei; Liu, Shuang; Zhou, Jiayong; Xu, Ye; Gu, Jinbao; Yan, Guiyun; Chen, Xiao-Guang								Vertical transmission of zika virus inAedes albopictus								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				14	10					e0008776	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008776				OCT 2020	2020	Background Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arthropod-borne flavivirus transmitted byAedesmosquitoes.Aedes albopictusis an important vector of ZIKV worldwide. To date, most experiments have focused on the vertical transmission of ZIKV inAe.aegypti, while studies onAe.albopictusare very limited. To explore vertical transmission inAe.albopictus, a series of laboratory studies were carried out. Methodology/Principal findings In this study,Ae.albopictuswere blood-fed with ZIKV-infectious blood, and the ovaries and offspring viral infection rates were analyzed by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). ZIKV was detected in the ovaries and oviposited eggs in two gonotrophic cycles. The minimum filial egg infection rates in two gonotrophic cycles were 2.06% and 0.69%, and the effective population transmission rate was 1.87%. The hatching, pupation, and emergence rates of infected offspring were not significantly different from those of uninfected offspring, indicating that ZIKV did not prevent the offspring from completing the growth and development process. ZIKV was detected in three of thirteen C57BL/6 suckling mice bitten by ZIKV-positive F(1)females, and the viremia persisted for at least seven days. Conclusions/Significance ZIKV can be vertically transmitted inAe.albopictusvia transovarial transmission. The vertical transmission rates in F(1)eggs and adults were 2.06% and 1.87%, respectively. Even though the vertical transmission rates were low, the female mosquitoes infected via the congenital route horizontally transmitted ZIKV to suckling mice through bloodsucking. This is the first experimental evidence of offspring with vertically transmitted ZIKV initiating new horizontal transmission. The present study deepens the understanding of the vertical transmission of flaviviruses inAedesmosquitoes and sheds light on the prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases.Author summary Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that poses a serious threat worldwide because of its associated serious neurological complications, such as Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults and microcephaly in newborns. Vertical transmission of ZIKV in humans has been confirmed. Furthermore, there have been reports of ZIKV infection in field-collected eggs, larvae and adult mosquitoes, which implies that ZIKV can also be vertically transmitted in mosquito vectors. However, the characteristics of vertical transmission of ZIKV inAedes albopictusremain unclear. Here, we infected mosquitoes by allowing them to feed on an infectious blood meal. F(1)progeny (eggs and adults) from mosquitoes with ZIKV-positive ovaries were studied. Our results demonstrate that ZIKV can be vertically transmitted inAe.albopictusvia transovarial transmission. The female mosquitoes infected via the congenital route can horizontally transmit ZIKV to suckling mice through bloodsucking. These updated findings can be used for ZIKV disease prevention and vector control strategies.																					WOS:000581738500001	33057411

Analysis of antibody response to an epitope in the haemagglutinin subunit 2 of avian influenza virus H5N1 for differentiation of infected and vaccinated chickens								AVIAN PATHOLOGY				49	2			161	170		10.1080/03079457.2019.1694635		DEC 2019		MAR 3 2020	2020	The H5N1 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus has been circulating in poultry in Indonesia since 2003 and vaccination has been used as a strategy to eradicate the disease. However, monitoring of vaccinated poultry flocks for H5N1 infection by serological means has been difficult, as vaccine antibodies are not readily distinguishable from those induced by field viruses. Therefore, a test that differentiates infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) would be essential. Currently, no simple and specific DIVA test is available for screening of a large number of vaccinated chickens. Several epitopes on E29 domain of the haemagglutinin H5N1 subunit 2 (HA2) have recently been examined for their antigenicity and potential as possible markers for DIVA in chicken. In this study, the potential of E29 as an antigen for DIVA was evaluated in detail. Three different forms of full-length E29 peptide, a truncated E29 peptide (E15), and a recombinant E29 were compared for their ability to detect anti-E29 antibodies. Preliminary ELISA experiments using mono-specific chicken and rabbit E29 sera, and a mouse monoclonal antibody revealed that the linear E29 peptide was the most antigenic. Further examination of the E29 antigenicity in ELISA, using several sera from experimentally infected or vaccinated chickens, revealed that the full-length E29 peptide had the greatest discrimination power between infected and vaccinated chicken sera while providing the least non-specific reaction. This study demonstrates the usefulness of the HPAI H5N1 HA2 E29 epitope as a DIVA antigen in HPAI H5N1-vaccinated and -infected chickens.																					WOS:000501636000001	31738584

TD-based unsupervised FE selected 134 altered genes, which were enriched in protein-protein interactions with orf1ab, polyprotein, and 3C-like protease that are well known to play critical roles in coronavirus infection, suggesting that these 134 genes can represent the coronavirus infectious process. We then selected compounds targeting the expression of the 134 selected genes based on a public domain database. The identified drug compounds were mainly related to known antiviral drugs, several of which were also included in those previously screened with an in silico method to identify candidate drugs for treating COVID-19.

Coxsackievirus infections in pregnant women with a parallel experimental model infection showing possible effects on course of pregnancy								Biopolymers and Cell				27	2			158	161						MAR-APR 2011	2011	Aim of our work was firstly to determine the prevalence of anti-coxsackievirus antibodies during pregnancy. 217 serum samples were tested for antibodies by virus neutralization test against coxsackie viruses (CV) B1-B6, A7 and A9. The second aim was to investigate experimental transmission of virus to the fetus during pregnancy. Methods. Virus Neutralization Test, RT-PCR. Results. In the serological study, paired blood serum samples from 217 pregnant women were studied for antibodies against coxsackie virus serotypes (CVB1-CVB6, CVA7 and CVA9) in sera of pregnant women from selected areas of the Slovak Republic. Coxsackievirus B4 (CVB4) infection was most prevalent, followed by CVB3, CVA7, CVA9, CVB5, CVB2, CVB1 while coxsackievirus B6 (CVB6) was scarce. In 30 out of 217 cases (13.82%) current infection was recorded. In the experimental murine study, in the second week of gravidity we observed presence of enteroviral RNA in the placenta and the intestine of the dead fetuses of the mice. Conclusions. Anti-CV antibodies were prevalent in the pregnant mothers indicating circulation of these viruses in the population. Current infection was shown in 13.82% of studied cases. Presence of virus RNA in the organs of the unborn fetuses in the experimental infection indicates the possibility of transfer of the coxsackie virus B4-E2 infection from mother to child during antenatal development.

J	Brown, DR; McClowry, TL; Bryan, JT; Stoler, M; Schroeder-Diedrich, JM; Fife, KH								A human papillomavirus related to human papillomavirus MM7/LVX82 produces distinct histological abnormalities in human foreskin implants grown as athymic mouse xenografts								VIROLOGY				249	1			150	159		10.1006/viro.1998.9294				SEP 15 1998	1998	Studies of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are hampered by the lack of a conventional culture system because HPV completes its life cycle only in fully differentiated human tissue. To overcome this obstacle, the athymic mouse xenograft system has been used to study the pathogenesis of HPV 11 and to develop neutralizing assays for vaccine development. Recently, HPV 40 has been produced in this system, and HPV 16 has been produced using mice with severe combined immune deficiency. To identify and characterize additional genital HPV types for similar studies, condylomata acuminata lesions containing a high copy number of HPV and detectable L1 major capsid protein were used to prepare infectious virus stocks. Human foreskin fragments were infected with the virus preparations and implanted under the renal capsules of athymic mice. After 5 months of growth, implant tissue was removed and processed for studies to detect HPV infection. Evidence of HPV infection was noted in some of the implants, but in contrast to HPV ii-infected epithelium, the implants derived from the new virus preparations contained a lesser degree of acanthosis, less developed koilocytosis, and a reduced number of preserved nuclei in the hyperkeratotic material within the cyst lining. The L1 consensus region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from implant DNA and sequenced. Alignment of the amplified sequences with those in the HPV sequence database showed that the 452-bp amplimer was closely related but not identical to HPV LVX82 and HPV MM7 (also called Pap 291). The entire 7.9-kb genome was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned. The presence of virions of the new isolate (named HPV IU) in the implants was verified by immunohistochemical detection of L1 major capsid protein and by demonstration of virion particles by electron microscopy. A second extract was made from one of the new implants and used to successfully propagate HPV IU. These experiments demonstrate that experimental infection of human epithelium with the new isolate, HPV IU, is associated with histological abnormalities that differ in potentially important ways from the changes observed in experimental HPV 11 infection.

Monatshefte fur Tierheilkunde				9				243	254						1957	1957	Suitability of the c.f. test as a diagnostic aid in rabies was tested in experimentally infected small laboratory animals. Antigen for routine examinations was prepared from brain material suspensions centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 min. Ammonium sulfate preciptation produced an increase in the titre without loss of antigenicity. This method was recommended for use when antigen content of brain tissue was too low to give a positive c.f. test. Details were given of the preparation of immune sera of relatively high titre. Negri bodies and infectivity were demonstrable during the incubation period in mice which had been infected intracerebrally and intramuscularly. For a positive c.f. reaction nearly 104 units of infectious virus were required. In various species of animals examined in a moribund state, all methods of examination yielded positive results. C.f. antigen was demonstrated in the brain of two foxes and one deer. It was concluded that successful demonstration of c.f. antigens depended on the virus titre, but the presence of Negri bodies appeared to depend more on the quality than the quantity of the circulating virus. A positive c.f. test, it was stated, was indicative of rabies whereas a negative one did not necessarily exclude the infection. [See also V.B. 28, 1415.]E.G.																					CABI:19582203218

The fiber pathways (e.g., fimbria-fornix) connecting the basal forebrain with these target areas in the cortex displayed axon spheroids which are often linked to axonal transport dysfunction. No evidence for significant cellular destruction was seen in the brain, including the cells of origin of these axons in the basal forebrain, We conclude that the motor, mood, learning and memory disabilities in BDV-infected rats are likely to result, in part, from cortical cholinergic denervation. The present study gives new insights into the pathogenesis of neurological disease caused by a noncytopathogenic virus.																					WOS:000071373200008	9458165

To date very little is known about fish NF45. In this study, we identified a NF45 (named CsNF45) from half smooth tongue sole Cynoglossus semilaevis and examined its gene organization, expression profile, and regulatory function. We found that CsNF45 is composed of 387 residues and shares 90.3%-97.9% overall sequence identities with the NF45 of human and teleosts. Genetic analysis showed that the genomic sequence of the ORF region of CsNF45 consists of 14 exons and 13 introns. Constitutive expression of CsNF45 occurred in multiple tissues including gill, muscle, brain, heart, liver, head kidney, spleen, and gut. Experimental infection with viral and bacterial pathogens upregulated the expression of CsNF45 in head kidney and spleen in a time-dependent manner. Transient transfection analysis showed that CsNF45 was localized in the nucleus and able to stimulate the activity of mouse IL-2 promoter. These results indicate that CsNF45 possesses immunoregulatory property and is possibly involved in host immune defense against bacterial and viral infection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

An indirect immunofluorescence assay for detecting virus-specific serum antibody was developed for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes. In the absence of a method for growing GoCV in cell culture, the assay was based on the reaction of antibodies with the GoCV capsid protein produced within baby hamster kidney cells using the eukaryotic Semliki forest virus expression vector. Using an optimized test that involved screening sera at 1: 50 dilution and the use of a fluorescein isothiocyanate anti-duck immunoglobulin conjugate, GoCV-specific antibody was detected in 141 (88.6%) of 159 samples obtained from 27 of 28 breeder flocks aged from 1 to 6 years. Testing also showed the presence of GoCV-specific antibody in 85 (40.9%) of 208 serum samples from birds aged 30 weeks or less. Although maternally derived antibody was detected in birds when 1 and 4 days old, actively acquired antibody was first detected in birds aged 53 days. Following experimental inoculation of 21-day-old geese with tissue homogenate containing GoCV, virus-specific antibody was detected in serum samples collected at 27 and 34 days post inoculation. It is concluded that the SFV expression vector approach may prove useful for developing serological tests for other viruses, including other avian circoviruses, that do not grow in cell culture.

The test was based on the use of biotinylated sheep antibodies against equine or swine IgM molecules bound to a streptavidin-coated ELISA plate. The captured IgM antibodies were detected by application of antigens prepared from the New Jersey and the Indiana VSV serotypes (VSV-NJ and VSV-IN, respectively) and mouse polyclonal antibodies against VSV-NJ and VSV-IN, The MC-ELISA was compared to a competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) and the standard microtiter serum neutralization (MTSN) assay by testing serum samples from horses and pigs experimentally infected with VSV-NJ or VSV-IN, The MC-ELISA detected specific homologous IgM antibodies from equine and swine sera as early as 5 and 4 days postinfection (DPI), respectively, and as late as 35 DPI. The MTSN test also detected antibodies as early as 5 DPI and as late as 160 DPI. In a similar fashion, the C-ELISA detected antibodies from 6 to 7 DPI and as late as 160 DPI. These results demonstrated that the MC-ELISA is a useful test for serodiagnosis of primary VSV infection in horses and pigs.																					WOS:000168664400002	11329443

In one int-2 transgenic line (TG cntdot NX), this growth disturbance is evoked by pregnancy and regresses after parturition. Regression of hyperplastic mammary epithelium is less complete after successive pregnancies, and, within 10 months, most TG cntdot NX mice stochastically develop mammary carcinomas that are transplantable in virgin, syngeneic mice. To identify genes that cooperate with int-2 in cell transformation, we infected TG cntdot NX transgenic mice with MMTV. In a cohort of 14 animals, most mammary tumors represented clonal or oligoclonal outgrowths harboring one to five proviral MMTV integrants. Eight of 35 (23%) MMTV+ tumors exhibited proviral insertion at the Wnt-1 locus. No provirus was detected at the int-2, int-3, or Wnt-3 loci. By Southern analysis, two tumors had proviral insertions at the same genomic location, which was mapped to chromosome 15. Cloning of this int locus identified an additional member of the Wnt gene family. The predicted 389-amino acid protein is most closely related to zebrafish Wnt-10a (58% amino acid identity over 362 residues) and, based on homology analysis, was designated Wnt-10b.

Antigens studied in experimentally infected domestic rabbits were cottontail rabbit papillomavirus particles produced with the athymic (nu/nu) mouse xenograft system and bacterial fusion proteins containing t e major or minor capsid protein. Recall reactions to antigens were tested by classic intracutaneous tests. Positive reactions had a biphasic course. Histopathology of skin test biopsy specimens showed infiltrating polymorphonuclear cells during the early stages. Later they were replaced by predominantly perivascular infiltrates composed of mononuclear cells. Time course of swelling and infiltrates resembled a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. Ten of 11 regressor rabbits (p = 0.00006) and 10 of 20 progressors (p = 0.009) had positive skin tests with intact and/or denaturated virus particles and individual capsid proteins also could elicit specific skin reactions. Skin reactivity to the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus particles was also greater (p = 0.042) in regressor rabbits (8 of 11) when compared to progressors (7 of 20). Recall reactions remained detectable at post-regression times, ranging from several months up to more than 2 years. We conclude that specific skin reactions against the cottontail rabbit papillomavirus in infected domestic rabbits exist, and are strongly positive to intact particles of this papillomavirus in animals (regressors) clinically free of disease.

Inheritance of resistance of mice to enteric bacterial and neurotropic virus infections								JOUR EXP MED				65	(2)			261	286		10.1084/jem.65.2.261				1937	1937	It was possible to select, from a hybrid stock of mice of which 40 to 50% die following a standard dose of B. enteritidis or St. Louis encephalitis virus, lines in which as high as 95% or as low as 15% succumbed. Three relatively stable lines after approximately 12 generations of selection and brother to sister or line inbreeding were developed; one bacteria-susceptible-virus-susceptible, one bacteria-susceptible-virus-resistant, and one bacteria-resistant-virus-susceptible. Crossing susceptible with resistant lines and testing F1, F2, F3 and back cross progeny resulted in mortality percentages approximating those expected on the basis that resistance to B. enteriditis and to encephalitis virus were inherited independently on a single factor basis with resistance dominant over susceptibility. All selected were found uniformly susceptible to a strain of mouse passage rabies virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W. E. Bunney																					BCI:BCI19381200000155	19870600

Mice infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyocarditis virus (TMEV) develop an immune-mediated demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD), characterized by progressive weakness associated with robust ITAbP, CNS inflammation and demyelination. TMEV-IDD represents an excellent model of human multiple sclerosis (MS), especially its progressive disability. The mechanism of the weakness in this disease is unknown but there is considerable evidence that it is immune-mediated. Our hypothesis was that the disability in the model is induced by robust ITAbP by antibody-secreting cells(ASCs) in the CNS. We further hypothesized that these ASCs are predominantly CD 138+ plasma cells, driven by the persistence of virus at high levels in the central nervous system (CNS) as well as high levels of B-cell activating factor (BAFF). In order to test these hypotheses we infected mice with TMEV, and correlated measures of ITAbP with disability. Measures of ITAbP were ELISpot and IgG gene expression, while disability was tested by Rotarod.We found that disability was highly correlated with ITAbP, assayed by number of CNS ASCs as well as amount of IgG mRNA. CNS ASCs were primarily CD 138+, and produced high levels of IgG enriched for reactivity to TMEV There were high levels of BAFF production in the CNS, but these levels were only minimally higher in infected mice than in uninfected controls. TMEV and IgG RNA were distributed throughout the spinal cord.These data are the first demonstrating that ITAbP is highly correlated with disability in TMEV infection, an excellent model of human MS. Our data raise the possibility that ITAbP contributes significantly to disability, both in this model and in MS. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Guinea pigs inoculated with the washed material showed typical disease after 7 days. Injected washed Rickettsias conferred immunity to-typhus. Strong evidence is brought forward to prove that the Rickettsias or Mooser bodies are the cause of typhus. Presence of a few cell fragments in the washings prevented the exps. from being conclusive.																					BCI:BCI19340800006283	19869794

All EBV-infected clones expressed EBER-1, EBNA-1, and LMP2A. The expression of LMP1 and LMP2B was variable. None, however, expressed EBNA2-6. The surface markers CD30, CD74, and syndecan-1 were down-regulated in EBV convertants. EBV-infected BC-3 and CRO-AP/6 cells were highly tumorigenic in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice in contrast to their respective EBV- parental cells. However, neither the parental cells nor the virus-converted counterparts expressed TCL1 The results showing that PEL cells on in vitro EBV infection do not sustain latency III despite the absence of immune pressure indicate that the choice of EBV latent gene expression program is cell dependent.

Rats inoculated with BDV within 24 hi after birth showed higher detection rates of viral RNA and viral proteins from the brain than rats inoculated at 4 weeks-old. Depending on the age of infection and the time postinfection, the detection of BDV RNA, protein, or anti-BDV antibody did not always correlate in individuals, We suggest both serological and molecular biological methods are needed in the diagnosis of BDV infection.

J	Fielding, Adele; Grote, Deanna; Cattaneo, Roberto								The Anti-Lymphoma Efficacy of Replicating, Attenuated Measles Virus Is Enhanced by Viral Expression of GM-CSF.								Blood				100	11 			2269	Abstract No. 2269						November 16, 2002	2002	Background. We recently demonstrated that attenuated measles virus (MV) is oncolytic in-vivo in human tumor xenograft models of lymphoma. We wished to investigate whether the addition of the potent immune adjuvant GM-CSF could enhance the oncolytic capacity of MV. Methods. We constructed 3 MV plasmids expressing murine GM-CSF (mGM-CSF) from additional transcription units (ATU) of MV. Virus was rescued and titrated on Vero cells. In order to characterise this virus in-vivo and to ensure that a MV expressing mGM-CSF would not result in unexpected toxicity, we infected mice transgenic for human CD46 with 106 pfu via intraperitoneal injection, alongside controls injected with unmodified MV. The oncolytic effect of MVmGM-CSF-P was evaluated in a SCID/ Raji tumor xenograft model and compared to that of the unmodified MV strain and a control, UV-inactivated MV. Results. The titres of the GM-CSF producing viruses were similar to those of the unmodified control virus. mGM-CSF production in the supernatant of the Vero cells reached a maximum of 60ng/ml/105 cells. No adverse effects were observed in any of the CD46 transgenic mice. GM-CSF levels above baseline (maximum 60 pg/mul) were detected in the serum from day 6 after infection and returned to baseline by day 20. Peripheral blood counts remained normal in these mice and neutrophilia was not observed. An antibody response to MV was detected at days 14 and 30, and there was a trend for a higher level antibody levels in the MVmGMCSF treated mice as compared to controls. With regard to oncolytic activity, there was a significant difference between MVmGM-CSF-P and non-modified MV, with considerable tumor regression after injection of MVmGM-CSF-P (N= 10 per group). This was an unexpected finding in mice lacking T cells to mediate this effect. In order to investigate the mechanism by which this enhanced oncolytic effect was occurring, we performed a separate experiment in which each three groups of 10 SCID mice bearing Raji tumors were injected with MVNse, MVmGM-CSF-P or recombinant mGM-CSF alone. Fourteen days after the injections, the tumors were excised, the cells were dissociated and subjected to FACS analysis to determine the murine cellular infiltrate. Murine CD45 positive cells (leucocytes) were found in all of the tumors, but there was a significant difference in the number of infiltrating cells between the 3 groups, with nearly 35% of the total cells being infiltrating leucocytes in the tumors injected with the GM-CSF producing viruses as compared to 5% for GM-CSF alone and 15% for MV. HEPSILON staining of tumor sections demonstrated large areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the necrotic areas were infiltrated with CD18 positive cells, most likely neutrophils. Further flow cytometric analysis of disaggregated MVmGM-CSF or MV injected tumors using antibodies against NK cells (DX5) and macrophages (Mac-3) have shown that only a small proportion of the CD45 positive cells appear to be NK cells (less than 1%) or macrophages (approximately 2%). Conclusions. The data show that recombinant MV expressing mGM-CSF can be generated. The viruses can be administered to CD46 transgenic mice and is eliminated by an immune response without toxicity. Expression of GM-CSF from an ATU of MV considerably enhances the oncolytic properties of this virus in a SCID/human lymphoma xenograft model. This effect appears to be mediated by an anti-tumor inflammatory response.					44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology	December 06-10, 2002December 06-10, 2002	American Society of HematologyAmerican Society of Hematology	Philadelphia, PA, USAPhiladelphia, PA, USA													BCI:BCI200300336966

Axonal Pathology and Demyelination in Viral Models of Multiple Sclerosis								DISCOVERY MEDICINE				18	97			79	89						JUL-AUG 2014	2014	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Monozygotic twin studies suggest that while there is a genetic contribution, genetics alone cannot be the sole determining factor in the development of MS. As the rates of MS are increasing, particularly among women, environmental factors such as viral infections are coming to the foreground as potential agents in triggering disease in genetically susceptible individuals. This review highlights pathological aspects related to two pre-clinical viral models for MS; data are consistent between these two models as experimental infection of susceptible mice can induce axonal degeneration associated with demyelination. These data are consistent with observations in MS that axonal damage or Wallerian degeneration is occurring within the CNS contributing to the disability and disease severity. Such early damage, where axonal damage is primary to secondary demyelination, could set the stage for more extensive immune mediated demyelination arising later.

The genetic relatedness and pathogenicity of these three viruses were investigated based on the nucleotide sequences of the glycoprotein G (gG) gene, experimental infection in hamsters, and comparison with horse isolates. The gG gene sequences of EHV-1 from onager and zebra were identical. The gG gene sequences of the gazelle isolate showed 99.5% identity to those of onager and zebra isolates. The gG gene sequences of EHV-1 isolated from horses were 99.9-100% identical and 98, 98 and 97.8% similar to gG from onager, zebra and gazelle isolates, respectively. Hamsters inoculated with onager, zebra and gazelle isolates had severe weight loss, compared with hamsters inoculated with horse isolates. The histopathological findings were related to the virulence of each isolate. The results indicated that EHV-1 isolates from onager, zebra and gazelle differ from horse EHV-1 and are much more virulent in hamsters.																					WOS:000243631200002	17051419

Interferon-lambda 3 Promotes Epithelial Defense and Barrier Function Against Cryptosporidium parvum Infection								CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY				8	1			1	20		10.1016/j.jcmgh.2019.02.007				2019	2019	BACKGROUND & AIMS: The epithelial response is critical for intestinal defense against Cryptosporidium, but is poorly understood. To uncover the host strategy for defense against Cryptosporidium, we examined the transcriptional response of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to C parvum in experimentally infected piglets by microarray. Up-regulated genes were dominated by targets of interferon (IFN) and IFN-lambda 3 was up-regulated significantly in infected piglet mucosa. Although IFN-lambda has been described as a mediator of epithelial defense against viral pathogens, there is limited knowledge of any role against nonviral pathogens. Accordingly, the aim of the study was to determine the significance of IFN-lambda 3 to epithelial defense and barrier function during C parvum infection.METHODS: The significance of C parvum-induced IFN-lambda 3 expression was determined using an immunoneutralization approach in neonatal C57BL/6 mice. The ability of the intestinal epithelium to up-regulate IFN-lambda 2/3 expression in response to C parvum infection and the influence of IFN-lambda 2/ 3 on epithelial defense against C parvum invasion, intracellular development, and loss of barrier function was examined using polarized monolayers of a nontransformed porcinederived small intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Specifically, changes in barrier function were quantified by measurement of transepithelial electrical resistance and transepithelial flux studies.RESULTS: Immunoneutralization of IFN-lambda 2/3 in C parvum-infected neonatal mice resulted in a significantly increased parasite burden, fecal shedding, and villus blunting with crypt hyperplasia during peak infection. In vitro, C parvum was sufficient to induce autonomous IFN-lambda 3 and interferonstimulated gene 15 expression by IECs. Priming of IECs with recombinant human IFN-lambda 3 promoted cellular defense against C parvum infection and abrogated C parvum-induced loss of barrier function by decreasing paracellular permeability to sodium.CONCLUSIONS: These studies identify IFN-lambda 3 as a key epithelial defense mechanism against C parvum infection.

Journal of vaccines & vaccination				3	5										2012-Sep-20	2012	The L.E.A.P.S.() (Ligand Epitope Antigen Presentation System) technology platform has been used to develop immunoprotective and immunomodulating small peptide vaccines for infectious and autoimmune diseases. Several products are currently in various stages of development, at the pre-clinical stage (in animal challenge efficacy studies). Vaccine peptides can elicit protection of animals from lethal viral (herpes simplex virus [HSV-1] and influenza A) infection or can block the progression of autoimmune diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis as in the collagen induced arthritis (CIA] or experimental autoimmune myocarditis (EAM) models). L.E.A.P.S. technology is a novel T-cell immunization technology that enables the design and synthesis of non-recombinant, proprietary peptide immunogens. Combination of a small peptide that activates the immune system with another small peptide from a disease-related protein, thus a conjugate containing both an Immune Cell Binding Ligand (ICBL) and a disease specific epitope, which allows the L.E.A.P.S. vaccines to activate precursors to differentiate and become more mature cells that can initiate and direct appropriate T cell responses. As such, readily synthesized, defined immunogens can be prepared to different diseases and are likely to elicit protection or therapy as applicable in humans as they are in mice. L.E.A.P.S. vaccines have promise for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases and for infections, such as influenza and HSV1. The protective responses are characterized as Th1 immune and immunomodulatory responses with increased IL-12p70 and IFN-gamma (Th1 cytokines) but reduced inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-17 (Th2 and Th17 cytokines) and concomitant changes in antibody subtypes. LEAPS immunogens have been used directly in vivo or as ex vivo activators of DC which are then administered to the host.																					MEDLINE:23400692	23400692

Human adenovirus Ad-36 induces adipogenesis via its E4 orf-1 gene								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY				32	3			397	406		10.1038/sj.ijo.0803748				MAR 2008	2008	Objective: Understanding the regulation of adipocyte differentiation by cellular and extracellular factors is crucial for better management of chronic conditions such as obesity, insulin resistance and lipodystrophy. Experimental infection of rats with a human adenovirus type 36 (Ad-36) improves insulin sensitivity and promotes adipogenesis, reminiscent of the effect of thiozolinediones. Therefore, we investigated the role of Ad-36 as a novel regulator of the adipogenic process.Design and Results: Even in the absence of adipogenic inducers, infection of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and human adipose-derived stem cells (hASC) by Ad-36, but not Ad-2 that is another human adenovirus, modulated regulatory points that spanned the entire adipogenic cascade ranging from the upregulation of cAMP, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and p38 signaling pathways, downregulation of Wnt10b expression, and increased expression of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 and consequential lipid accumulation. Next, we identified that E4 open reading frame (orf)-1 gene of the virus is necessary and sufficient for Ad-36-induced adipogenesis. Selective knockdown of E4 orf-1 by RNAi abrogated Ad-36-induced adipogenic signaling cascade in 3T3-L1 cells and hASC. Compared to the null vector, selective expression of Ad-36 E4 orf-1 in 3T3-L1 induced adipogenesis, which was abrogated when the PDZ-binding domain of the protein was deleted.Conclusion: Thus, Ad-36 E4 orf-1 is a novel inducer of rodent and human adipocyte differentiation process.

J	Kimball, Abigail K; Oko, Lauren M; Kaspar, Rachael E; van Dyk, Linda F; Clambey, Eric T								High-Dimensional Characterization of IL-10 Production and IL-10-Dependent Regulation during Primary Gammaherpesvirus Infection.								ImmunoHorizons				3	3			94	109		10.4049/immunohorizons.1800088				2019 Mar 21	2019	IL-10 is a potent immunomodulatory cytokine produced by multiple cell types to restrain immune activation. Many herpesviruses use the IL-10 pathway to facilitate infection, but how endogenous IL-10 is regulated during primary infection in vivo remains poorly characterized. In this study, we infected mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gammaHV68) and analyzed the production and genetic contribution of IL-10 by mass cytometry (cytometry by time-of-flight) analysis. gammaHV68 infection elicited a breadth of effector CD4 T cells in the lungs of acutely infected mice, including a highly activated effector subset that coexpressed IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-10. By using IL-10 GFP transcriptional reporter mice, we identified that IL-10 was primarily expressed within CD4 T cells during acute infection in the lungs. IL10gfp-expressing CD4 T cells were highly proliferative and characterized by the expression of multiple coinhibitory receptors, including PD-1 and LAG-3. When we analyzed acute gammaHV68 infection of IL-10-deficient mice, we found that IL-10 limits the frequency of both myeloid and effector CD4 T cell subsets in the infected lung, with minimal changes at a distant mucosal site. These data emphasize the unique insights that high-dimensional analysis can afford in investigating antiviral immunity and provide new insights into the breadth, phenotype, and function of IL-10-expressing effector CD4 T cells during acute virus infection.

The brains of 3 moribund rabbits, previously inoculated by the subdural route with a highly concentrated suspension of the fixed strain of virus, were homogenized, suspended in 0.25 [image] sucrose, and centrifuged at various speeds to separate nuclear, cytoplasmic, mito-chondrial, and microsomal fractions. The titers of virus in the various fractions were determined by the intracerebral inoculation of mice. All fractions appeared to have similar virus titers, ranging from 10-4.3 to 10-5.5, except for the mitochondrial preparation which had a titer of 10-3.7, which was significantly lower than that of the material from which it was separated. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Emilio Weiss																					BCI:BCI19583200020427

Characteristic of candid 1 attenuated strain of Junin virus after one passage through cultured human cells								Comunicaciones Biologicas				14	2			151	160						1996	1996	To establish the virulence characteristic of Candid 1 vaccine strain of Junin virus after one passage through human cells, we infected human peripheral blood lymphomononuclear cells (HPBLC) with Candid 1 strain in comparison with Cba FHA 5069 wild strain of Junin virus. Virus was isolated by cocultivation of HPBLC with Vero cell monolayers (Junin virus permissive cell line). The virulence (lethality) index of Candid 1 strain and its HPBLC passage were studied in 11-day-old albino mice. We demonstrated that both strains of Junin virus studied replicate in HPBLC "in vitro" and that the infection is not productive. The virus production in these cells is more efficient with Cba FHA 5069 wild strain than with Candid 1 Candid 1 strain of Junin virus in cultured human cells attenuated strain of Junin virus. Thus, the replication ability in HPBLC could be a useful "in vitro" marker of Junin virus strains virulence. Moreover, our results firmly indicate that one "in vitro" passage through HPBLC did not affect Candid 1 strain attenuation level.																					BCI:BCI199799616522

Melatonin prevents the decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes and activates nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 signaling in an animal model of fulminant hepatic failure of viral origin								JOURNAL OF PINEAL RESEARCH				49	2			193	200		10.1111/j.1600-079X.2010.00787.x				SEP 2010	2010	This work was undertaken to investigate whether treatment with melatonin prevents oxidative stress and changes in the expression and activity of factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated antioxidant enzymes in an animal model of fulminant hepatic failure of viral origin. Rabbits were experimentally infected with 2 x 104 hemagglutination units of a rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) isolate and received melatonin at two concentrations of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg at 0, 12 and 24 hr postinfection. Blood transaminases, blood lactate dehydrogenase, liver concentration of thiobarbituric reactive acid substances and the liver oxidized to reduced glutathione ratio significantly increased at 36 hr postinfection in infected animals. Significant decreases were found in the mRNA levels and in the liver activities of Mn-superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione-S-transferase in infected rabbits. These effects were prevented by melatonin administration in a concentration-dependent manner. Melatonin treatment was not accompanied by changes in protein levels of Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1) but resulted in an increased protein expression of Nrf2 in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, which was confirmed by the results of Nrf2 immunostaining. Nuclear extracts from livers of melatonin-treated rats displayed an enhanced antioxidant responsive element (ARE)-binding activity of Nrf2. Our results suggest a potential hepatoprotective role of melatonin in fulminant hepatic failure, partially mediated through the abrogation of oxidative stress and the prevention of the decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes via the Nrf2 pathways.

J	Godino, R F; Fernandez, A I								New polymorphism of the influenza virus resistance Mx1 gene in Iberian domestic pigs.								Postdoc journal : a journal of postdoctoral research and postdoctoral affairs				4	9			15	19						2016-Sep	2016	Mx1 (Myxovirus (Influenza virus) resistance 1, interferon-inducible protein p78) gene has been implicated in the resistance to a wide range of RNA viruses including influenza A in several species such as Sus scrofa. In the present study a 28-bp deletion in exon 14 of the Mx1 gene has been identified in Iberian domestic pigs but not in other domestic breeds neither in wild boars. The mutation produces a frameshift giving a protein with 6 amino acid substitutions and the extension of the C-terminal region with additional 20 amino acids with respect to the wild type MX1 protein. The new allelic polymorphism affects the antiviral domain of the MX1 protein and therefore might impact its anti-influenza virus activity. It has been demonstrated that polymorphisms in the Mx1 murine locus, affect the survival rate of mice upon experimental infection with influenza virus. It might be possible to improve the innate resistance of pigs to influenza virus infection by determining the porcine Mx1 alleles with more potent antiviral activity and genetically selecting animals bearing such alleles.

The disease can be transmitted experimentally to cattle. The virus has been found in the mucus membrane of the mouth as well as in the blood. The chief pathological changes are in the mucous membrane of the mouth and the epithelium of the muzzle. The virus is species-specific; horse, sheep, goat, rabbit and guinea-pig are resistant. It could not be cultured on the chorio-allantoic membrane of the hen's egg. Infection was followed by an accumulation of acidophilic and plasma cells and inclusion bodies in the affected epithelium. After several weeks in glycerine the virus caused lesions which are less extensive than those produced by fresh material from natural infection, but the type of pathological change was nearly the same in both instances. The difference was probably due to the absence of bacteria in the treated material. The bacteria are considered to play a role in natural infections. From the nature of the cell changes and the type of virus bodies produced this virus appears to be related to pox viruses. However, the virus of cattle does not seem to be the same as the stomatosis papulosa virus of the horse. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. D. Bushnell																					BCI:BCI19411500000922

We infected a primary neuronal culture derived from mdx mouse hippocampus with these viruses. Minidystrophin was observed along the plasma membrane as punctate dots or very short segments. In double immunofluorescence staining with anti-dystrophin and anti-postsynaptic density-95 antibodies, we observed that these proteins entirely colocalized. On the other hand, the truncated minidystrophin, which has deleted WW, cysteine-rich and C-terminal domains, was homogenously expressed in cytoplasm, neurites and axons. These findings suggest that a binding site to postsynaptic densities exists in the region extending from the WW dornain to the C-terminal domain of dystrophin and that this site is necessary for binding to membrane.

To study cellular countermechanisms that might prevent this pathology, we screened for rat strains resistant to this BDV-induced neuronal degeneration. To this end, we infected hippocampal slice cultures of different rat strains with BDV and analyzed for the preservation of the DG. Whereas infected cultures of five rat strains, including Lewis (LEW) rats, exhibited a disrupted DG cytoarchitecture, slices of three other rat strains, including Sprague Dawley (SD), were unaffected. However, efficiency of viral replication was comparable in susceptible and resistant cultures. Moreover, these rat strain dependent differences in vulnerability were replicated in vivo in neonatally infected LEW and SD rats. Intriguingly, conditioned media from uninfected cultures of both LEW and SD rats could prevent BDV-induced DG damage in infected LEW hippocampal cultures, whereas infection with BDV suppressed the availability of these factors from LEW but not in SD hippocampal cultures. To gain further insights into the genetic basis for this rat strain dependent susceptibility, we analyzed DG granule cell survival in BDV-infected cultures of hippocampal neurons derived from the F1 and F2 offspring of the crossing of SD and LEW rats. Genome-wide association analysis revealed one resistance locus on chromosome (chr) 6q16 in SD rats and, surprisingly, a locus on chr3q21-23 that was associated with susceptibility. Thus, BDV-induced neuronal degeneration is dependent on the host genetic background and is prevented by soluble protective factors in the disease-resistant SD rat strain.

The strain was not changed clinically or serologically by this passage. Exptlly. infected fleas show a great multiplication of Rickettsia, morphologically indistinguishable from those found in experimentally infected laboratory animals. The time of max. incidence of X. cheopis is after the ending of the rains in Aug. and Sept., the period when human typhus cases appear.

Evolution of ocular defects in infant macaques following in utero Zika virus infection								JCI INSIGHT				5	24					e143947	10.1172/jci.insight.143947				DEC 17 2020	2020	Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) is associated with microcephaly and various neurological, musculoskeletal, and ocular abnormalities, but the long-term pathogenesis and postnatal progression of ocular defects in infants are not well characterized. Rhesus macaques are superior to rodents as models of CZS because they are natural hosts of the virus and share similar immune and ocular characteristics, including blood-retinal barrier characteristics and the unique presence of a macula. Using a previously described model of CZS, we infected pregnant rhesus macaques with Zika virus (ZIKV) during the late first trimester and characterized postnatal ocular development and evolution of ocular defects in 2 infant macaques over 2 years. We found that one of them exhibited colobomatous chorioretinal atrophic lesions with macular and vascular dragging as well as retinal thinning caused by loss of retinal ganglion neuron and photoreceptor layers. Despite these congenital ocular malformations, axial elongation and retinal development in these infants progressed at normal rates compared with healthy animals. The ZIKV-exposed infants displayed a rapid loss of ZIKV-specific antibodies, suggesting the absence of viral replication after birth, and did not show any behavioral or neurological defects postnatally. Our findings suggest that ZIKV infection during early pregnancy can impact fetal retinal development and cause congenital ocular anomalies but does not appear to affect postnatal ocular growth.

Impaired T-cell immunity allows the outgrowth of transformed cells with the subsequent production of predominantly B-cell lymphomas. Currently there is no in vivo model that can adequately recapitulate EBV infection and its association with B-cell lymphomas. NOD/SCID mice engrafted with human CD34(+) cells and reconstituted mainly with human B lymphocytes may serve as a useful xenograft model to study EBV infection and pathogenesis. We therefore infected reconstituted mice with EBV. High levels of viral DNA were detected in the peripheral blood of all infected mice. All infected mice lost weight and showed decreased activity levels. Infected mice presented large visible tumors in multiple organs, most prominently in the spleen. These tumors stained positive for human CD79a, CD20, CD30, and EBV-encoded RNAs and were light chain restricted. Their characterization is consistent with that of large cell immunoblastic lymphoma. In addition, tumor cells expressed EBNA1, LMP1, and LMP2a mRNAs, which is consistent with a type II latency program. EBV+ lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing human CD45, CD19, CD21, CD23, CD5, and CD30 were readily established from the bone marrow and spleens of infected animals. Finally, we also demonstrate that infection with an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged virus can be monitored by the detection of infected EGFP(+) cells and EGFP(+) tumors. These data demonstrate that NOD/SCID mice that are reconstituted with human CD34(+) cells are susceptible to infection by EBV and accurately recapitulate important aspects of EBV pathogenesis.

Infection by Mha is often associated with or promoted by respiratory viral pathogens and environmental conditions. Infections due to Mha have rarely been described in small ruminants. This study reports the biological and molecular characteristics of a new Moroccan Mha isolate from small ruminants presenting typical respiratory symptoms. We also studied the cultural parameters, growth kinetics, and Lkt excretion of the isolate and its pathogenicity on laboratory animals and small ruminants. Materials and Methods: Suspected pasteurellosis cases in sheep and goat flocks in Morocco were investigated. A local strain of Mha was isolated and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. Polymerase chain reaction-targeting specific genes were used for serotyping and phylogenetic analyses; further, leukotoxin production, cytotoxicity, and pathogenicity of the isolate in mice, goats, and sheep were investigated. Results: Phylogeny analysis revealed 98.76% sequence identity with the USA isolate of 2013; the strain growth with a cycle of 9-10 h with leukotoxin secretion was detected by NETosis and quantified by cytotoxicity and mortality of mice. Goat and sheep infections cause hyperthermia, with characteristic postmortem lesions in the trachea and lung. Conclusion: A local isolate of Mha from sheep that died of pneumonia was characterized for the 1st time in North Africa using biological and molecular methods. Although growth on appropriate culture media is accompanied by intense leukotoxin secretion, experimental infections of sheep and goats cause hyperthermia and typical lesions of pneumonia.

The hemagglutinin gene (HA) of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 had the multiple amino acid sequences (-PEIPKGRG-) at the connecting peptide between HA1 and HA2, which is considered to be a distinguishing molecular characteristic of low pathogenicity. The key sites of host markers among the genes (M, NP, NS, PA and PB2) of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 were similar to those of H5N1 viruses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the genes (M, NS and PB2) of Dk/Hb/216/85/H7N8 clustered closely with those of Gs/Guangdong/1996/H5N1 (Gs/GD/96), implying that three ancient genes of Gs/GD/96-like viruses had been circulating in Central China during the 1980s.

On day 3 after experimental infection with 10(5.5) pfu of PIV3, animals were treated with 2-fold dilutions of convalescent cotton rat serum or with one of two purified human immunoglobulin preparations; all three had moderate titers of anti-PIV3 neutralizing antibody (range, 1:200-1:1000). Therapy with high concentrations of all three preparations resulted in significant reductions of greater than or equal to 2 logs (greater than or equal to 100-fold) of pulmonary virus titers compared with titers for control animals. Little or no reduction in virus titers were seen in nasal tissues.																					WOS:A1995RF04100037	7797921

J	Hancock, GE; Heers, KM; Smith, JD								QS-21 synergizes with recombinant interleukin-12 to create a potent adjuvant formulation for the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus								VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY				13	4			503	509		10.1089/vim.2000.13.503				2000	2000	In the murine model of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, recombinant interleukin-12 (rIL-12) was previously demonstrated to be most effective as an adjuvant for fusion (F) protein-based vaccines after adsorption to alum adjuvant. Alum, however, is a potent inducer of polarized T-cell responses and the type 2 phenotype. In addition, studies in human cancer patients demonstrated that rIL-12 was toxic when administered systemically at high doses. Because of these issues, we investigated whether the saponin QS-21 could facilitate a reduction in dose of rIL-12 when F protein was prepared in the absence of alum (F/rIL-12). The results demonstrated that a suboptimal dose (0.8 mug) of QS-21 enhanced the capacity of F/rIL-2 to elicit antigen-dependent killer cell precursors and complement-assisted neutralizing antibodies in spleens and sera respectively of BALB/c mice. The killer cell activity of mice vaccinated with F/rIL-12 (0.1 mug) plus 0.8 mug QS-21 was equivalent to that elicited after vaccination by experimental infection, or with an optimal dose of QS-21. The neutralizing titers generated by F/rIL-12 (0.01 to 1.0 mug) were also significantly elevated in the presence of 0.8 mug QS-21. Thus, rIL-12 and QS-21 together form a potent adjuvant for eliciting functional cell-mediated and humoral immune responses against F protein.																					WOS:000166248300012	11192297	
J	LESBOUYRIES, M.								Psittacosis (Review).				La psittacose.				Recueil de Medecine Veterinaire				113				279	299						1937	1937	Psittacosis in man was first described by JURGENSEN in 1876, as an atypical case of pneumonia. It is primarily a virus disease of parrots and is of importance only because of its transmissibility to man, in whom the death rate is approximately 20%. In the parrot family nearly all species of which suffer from the naturally occurring disease, psittacosis presents no precise symptoms or exact pathological changes. The period of incubation is from 9-15 days, and 3 forms of the disease are recognized. In the peracute form which is rare, an apparently healthy bird dies in coma in a few hours. In the acute form there is fever accompanied by convulsive tremors and painful respiration. There is a mucous exudate in the nasal cavities and eyes and diarrhoea; death follows in 4-8 days. The latent form shows no clinical signs; on autopsy, the intestines are inflamed, the lungs oedema-tous and congested, the liver hard and yellowish in colour, while the spleen is enlarged.The disease is rarely fatal in tropical countries, but in Europe and the United States, due in all probability to the effects of transport and of a colder climate, death is much more frequent.Diagnosis in birds of the parrot family is difficult, the most suitable method being intraperit. inoc. of mice with a filtered emulsion of spleen. The mouse may die in anything from 15 hours to several weeks, depending upon the virulence of the strain of virus. Post-mortem examination of the mouse shows enlargement of the liver and spleen with a sticky exudate in the thorax and abdomen. The virus itself passes Chamberland L15 L2, L3, Seitz EK and Berkefeld V but not Berkefeld W filters. Soon after the filtrability of the causal agent was discovered, COLE found, in the blood, liver and spleen of persons and birds dead of the disease, coccoid rickettsia-like bodies 0.2-0.3 in diameter. They stain red with Giemsa's stain, but are best demonstrated with Berry's modification of Castaneda's method. They are diagnostic of psittacosis and, although more easily found in the experimentally infected mouse than in a natural case of the disease, are now held to be the virus itself. There is great variation in the virulence of individual strains, but in some cases it may be augmented by passage. The resistance of the organism also shows some variation, but it is destroyed by heating at 70°C. in 45 minutes, and by 0-5% phenol at 37°C. in 20 hours. Dried parrot spleen has, however, been shown to remain infective for 277 days. Experimentally, all parrots are susceptible, as well as the monkey, rabbit, g. pig, canary and domestic poultry, while mice are the most suitable subjects for diagnostic purposes. The incubation period and type of disease produced depend upon the individual animal or bird, but generally young birds are the easiest to infect.Man may become infected by direct contact with affected persons, with birds, which may, however, show no sign of the disease or in the laboratory. Persons over 40 years of age are most commonly attacked. The death rate is 20%. The treatment of birds is useless and dangerous and in man is mainly symptomatic. Conflicting reports are given on the use of convalescent sera. Prophylaxis is discussed at some length, but resolves itself into the total prohibition of the importation of birds of the parrot family.-A. WILSON TAYLOR.																					CABI:19372201400		
J	Fischer, F; Peng, D; Hingley, ST; Weiss, SR; Masters, PS								The internal open reading frame within the nucleocapsid gene of mouse hepatitis virus encodes a structural protein that is not essential for viral replication								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				71	2			996	1003		10.1128/JVI.71.2.996-1003.1997				FEB 1997	1997	The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) contains a large open reading frame embedded entirely within the 5' half of its nucleocapsid (N) gene. This internal gene (designated I) is in the +1 reading frame with respect to the N gene, and it encodes a mostly hydrophobic 23-kDa polypeptide. We have found that this protein is expressed in MHV-infected cells and that it is a previously unrecognized structural protein of the virion. To analyze the potential biological importance of the I gene, we disrupted its expression by site directed mutagenesis using targeted RNA recombination. The start codon for I was replaced by a threonine codon, and a stop codon was introduced at a short interval downstream. Both alterations created silent changes in the N reading frame. In vitro translation studies showed that these mutations completely abolished synthesis of I protein, and immunological analysis of infected cell lysates confirmed this conclusion. The MHV I mutant was viable and grew to high titer. However, the I mutant had a reduced plaque size in comparison with its isogenic wild-type counterpart, suggesting that expression of I confers some minor growth advantage to the virus. The engineered mutations were stable during the course of experimental infection in mice, and the I mutant showed no significant differences from wild type in its ability to replicate in the brains or livers of infected animals. These results demonstrate that I protein is not essential for the replication of MHV either in tissue culture or in its natural host.																					WOS:A1997WC30500018	8995618

The Old World alphaviruses, which include chikungunya virus, Ross River virus, and Sindbis virus, tend to cause a clinical syndrome characterized by fever, rash, and arthritis, whereas the New World alphaviruses, which consist of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, eastern equine encephalitis virus, and western equine encephalitis virus, induce encephalomyelitis. Following recovery from the acute phase of infection, many patients are left with debilitating persistent joint and neurological complications that can last for years. Clues from human cases and studies using animal models strongly suggest that much of the disease and pathology induced by alphavirus infection, particularly atypical and chronic manifestations, is mediated by the immune system rather than directly by the virus. This review discusses the current understanding of the immunopathogenesis of the arthritogenic and neurotropic alphaviruses accumulated through both natural infection of humans and experimental infection of animals, particularly mice. As treatment following alphavirus infection is currently limited to supportive care, understanding the contribution of the immune system to the disease process is critical to developing safe and effective therapies.

Ранняя защита от гриппа с помощью пандемических живых гриппозных вакцин|Early protection against influenza by pandemic live attenuated influenza vaccines								Meditsinskii akademicheskii zhurnal	Медицинский академический журнал			19	3			37	46						2019	2019	Live attenuated cold-adapted (ca) influenza vaccine (LAIV) is an effective tool for the control of influenza, most likely due to their ability to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses, easy application and relatively low manufacturing costs. Attenuated cold-adapted vaccine strains that have achieved a satisfactory balance between restricted replication and high immunogenicity are desirable. The immunogenicity of live attenuated vaccines may depend upon the interplay between its ability to induce pro-inflammatory cytokine responses and the relative sensitivity of the attenuated vaccine strain to an antiviral effect of these cytokines. To better understand the relationship between attenuation and induction of innate immunity as well as contribution of the early cytokine response to the relative immunogenicity of LAIVs, we have studied early protection induced by LAIV in vivo as well as early cytokine response in human cells macrophage origin in response to infection with vaccine strains or epidemic virus. The aim of this study was to investigate the early immune response and protective activity in female CBA mice intranasally immunized with cold-adapted influenza vaccine strains of different genome compositions of 5:3 or 6:2. For experimental infection pandemic influenza viruses A/South Africa/3626/13 (H1N1)pdm09 and A/New York/61/15 (H1N1)pdm09 were used to be administered to animals at a dose of 106 EID50 at day 3 after immunization (challenge infection). Although challenge viruses replicate at mice lungs at various, extend, on day 10 after immunization mice were protected from death from 60 up to 80%. Reassortants LAIV did not differ statistically on these levels. Study of the expression of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta genes in human lung macrophage line cells THP-1 in vitro have shown that macrophages stimulated with vaccine strains with the genome formula 6:2 and 5:3, had a sufficient level of expression of these genes, comparable to that, as in infection with wild virus type A/South Africa/3626/13 (H1N1)pdm09. These data may indicate that surface proteins of influenza A virus are involved in the process of stimulation of the IFN-alpha and IFN-beta genes.																					RSCI:41593802

Bystander responses impact accurate detection o f murine and human antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells								JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION				129	9			3894	3908		10.1172/JCI124443				SEP 3 2019	2019	Induction of memory CD8(+) T cells is important for controlling infections such as malaria and HIV/AIDS and for cancer immunotherapy. Accurate assessment of antigen-specific (Ag-specific) CD8(+) T cells is critical for vaccine optimization and for defining correlates of protection. However, conditions for determining Ag-specific CD8(+)T cell responses ex vivo using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) may be variable, especially in humans with complex antigens. Here, we used an attenuated whole parasite malaria vaccine model in humans and various experimental infections in mice to show that the duration of antigenic stimulation and timing of brefeldin A (BFA) addition influence the magnitude of Ag-specific and bystander T cell responses. Indeed, after immunization with an attenuated whole sporozoite malaria vaccine in humans, significantly higher numbers of IFN-gamma-producing memory CD8(+)T cells comprising Ag-specific and bystander responses were detected when the duration of Ag stimulation prior to addition of BFA was increased. Mechanistic analyses of virus-specific CD8(+)T cells in mice revealed that the increase in IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells was due to bystander activation of Ag-experienced memory CD8(+)T cells, and correlated with the proportion of Ag-experienced CD8(+)T cells in the stimulated populations. Incubation with anti-cytokine antibodies (e.g., IL-12) improved accuracy in detecting bona fide memory CD8(+)T cell responses. suggesting this as the mechanism for the bystander activation. These data have important implications for accurate assessment of immune responses generated by vaccines intended to elicit protective memory CD8(+)T cells.

We used the model of murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) caused by a murine leukemia virus (MuLV) that induces immunologic alterations with similarities to those accompanying human HIV infection to study aspects of concomitant infections. The MuLV infection was found to reactivate T. cruzi infection in C57Bl/10 mice, as indicated by elevated parasitemia and lymphocytic infiltration in the myocardium. The T cells from these animals did not respond to T. cruzi antigens (lymphocyte proliferation, interferon-gamma, or interleukin-2 [IL-2] production) but had increased levels of IL-10. Trypanosoma cruzi-specific antibody was decreased but not absent in dually infected animals. In a second set of experiments, we infected MAIDS-resistant B6D2 mice with MuLV, followed by infection with T. cruzi. These animals had higher parasitemia than those infected with T. cruzi alone. More interestingly, only dually infected animals developed MAIDS. The present report describes the activation of T. cruzi infection by MuLV as well as the aggravation of MuLV infection by T. cruzi. These results may be relevant to coinfections with retrovirus and protozoan parasites in humans.																					WOS:A1993MK14100008	8250098

The inoculated animals were observed daily for dullness, anorexia, occult blood in faeces, petechial haemorrhages, lacrymation, paralysis, cachexia, death. Necropsied animals were examined for gastrointestinal haemorrhages and lymphadenopathy. The severity of clinical symptoms in various rodents declined as follows: (i) BL6 (nu/nu) mice exhibited most severe manifestation of all the aforementioned symptoms followed by (ii) NMRI (nu/nu), (iii) BL6 (nu/+) (iv) NMRI (nu/+) and C57BL6, (v) DBA, C3H/Hej and BALB/c, and (vi) Swiss. These results indicate that adaptation of DV-2 to the mouse may be an important factor in exaltation of virulence.

The probes were used to optimize the in situ hybridization (ISH) method on baby hamster kidney-21 (BHK-21) cells and to investigate the use of the technique as a diagnostic procedure.Cells were infected with BTV4 at a multiplicity of infection of 0,5 PFU/cell. An intense cytoplasmic hybridization signal could be detected from 3 hours post-infection onwards, reaching a peak at 17 hours. The ISH procedure has potential use as a diagnostic technique, but will probably find a wider application in pathogenesis studies.An in situ hybridization method was also developed for the detection of BTV RNA in the central nervous system of newborn mice after intracranial inoculation with BTV10. Viral RNA-positive cells were detected from Day 3 onwards, predominantly in areas where the virus caused necrotic encephalitis.																					WOS:A1993LV37500005	8392680	
J	REMLINGER, P.; BAILEY, J.								Etudes sur la rage. I								ANN INST PASTEUR [PARIS]				47	(6)			608	659						1931	1931	Rabies virus was recovered with the same fre-quency from spleen, liver and kidney of animals treated with a large dose of emulsified rabic guinea-pig spleen by injection under the dura mater and in the muscles of the neck. The cat and a concentrated virus in each case provided the greatest number of positive results. The susceptibility of these organs is attributed to the action of the virus on the peripheral nerve centers, neurons and nerve ganglia. Certain portions of the central nervous system were demonstrated to be avirulent. The fact that experimental animals receiving injections of material from these areas do not contract rabies may account for error in diagnoses of rabic animals. The multiplicity of fixed virus was demonstrated and cited as the cause of confusion in attempting to obtain a strain possessing a high standard for immunization purposes. Frogs and toads are resistant to rabies virus. Failure to obtain passage of fixed virus in the central nervous system of vaccinated animals could not be accounted for by the strain employed, or by method of treatment and animals used. Subcutaneous injection of normal nerve tissue did not sensitize rabbits to the virus. The activity of the virus was independent of dilution. The authors conclude that "mal de caderas bovin" and similar epidemics are practically identical with paralytic rabies. Antirabic treatments repeated indefinitely and at intervals of 4 mos. to 10 yrs. produced no anaphylactic reaction in man or animals. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Elizabeth A.

It circulated for some time in the lymphatic and blood vascular systems and then gradually invaded other organs. In young mice weighing 14-16 g, the virus spread from the lymphatic and blood vascular systems to the organs more rapidly than in older mice weighing 25-28 g. At the peak of the infection, when the maximum virus titer was reached in the brain, virus was also found in most of the other organs. At this stage (192 hours after infection), the virus titer in the organs was influenced by the extent of the specific antibody response. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19613600049246

Oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify a 401-bp fragment spanning the 26S/intergenic spacer region of the rDNA complex of A. fumigatus by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The primers were highly sensitive and specific: as little as 1 pg of A. fumigatus genomic DNA could be detected, and the primers only amplified DNA from A. fumigatus and not any other fungal, bacterial, viral, or human DNA tested. Using the PCR, we were able to detect A. fumigatus DNA in lung homogenates from immunosuppressed mice experimentally infected with A. fumigatus but not from immunosuppressed uninfected controls. There was 93% correlation between the culture results and the PCR results. In a retrospective clinical study, the sensitivity of the PCR for the detection of A. fumigatus in clinical samples was confirmed by positive amplification in three of three culture-positive respiratory samples from confirmed cases of IA. Because isolation of Aspergillus spp. may reflect contamination and colonization without infection, the feasibility of using the PCR was evaluated by analyzing culture-negative samples from both immunosuppressed patients at high risk for IA and immunocompetent patients with other lung infections. Only 2 of 10 patients were culture negative and PCR positive in the high-risk group, and 2 of 7 patients were culture negative and PCR positive in the immunocompetent group. The results indicate that PCR detection might be a valuable adjunct to current laboratory methods to diagnose IA.																					WOS:A1993KM81000027	8458955

RNA was extracted from tissues of experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR with SPV-specific primers. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced to identify splice junctions. A total of 14 distinct sequences were identified as putative partial transcripts. Of these, 13 were spliced; a single unspliced transcript putatively encoded NS1. Sequence analysis revealed that spliced partial transcripts may encode portions of open reading frames for the major capsid proteins VP1 and VP2 and smaller, unknown proteins. These unspliced and spliced transcripts and putative proteins encoded by SPV were similar to those of B19. Initial splice junctions at nucleotides 279 and 333 were analogous to those at nucleotides 406 and 441, respectively, in B19. Seven of the 10 splices identified had typical GT/AG donor/acceptor junctions. The splice sites were confirmed by Northern blotting and autoradiography. In contrast to B19, which has a maximum of two splices per transcript, up to three splices were observed in SPV transcripts. A spliced transcript putatively encoding a truncated version of NS1, as seen with minute virus of mice and adeno-associated virus 2, was also observed. The findings indicate that that the splicing pattern of transcripts of SPV and B19 is similar, but SPV also has coding strategies in common with other parvoviruses.

B	LANGVAD, E.								Imferon induction of Lung tumors in mice								Proceedings of the third quadrennial conference on cancer Lung tumors in animals 24-29 June, 1965 Perugia, Italy								897	904						1966	1966	Local tumors which developed at the site of injection were fibrosarcomas. Distant tumors were of multifocal and widespread origin. The morphology of the tumors was determined by the type of non-malignant tissue neighboring the Fe deposits. Does the Imferon induced Fe deposit act carcinogenically ? This would comply with the gross similarity of latency for local and distant tumors as well as with the widespread and multifocal development of tumors in these animals, that had 2 or 3 simultaneous tumors of different histological pattern. The Imferon induced Fe deposits are stored in stromal phagocytes. The tumors develop from the neighboring cells of different morphology. The primary response to many chemical carcinogens applied to surfaces is stromal reaction. Later, development of tumor is noticed in the overlying surface-structure, indicating that a primary stromal defectiveness induced by the carcinogen is the basic condition for uncontrolled growth in tiie neighboring structures. The malignant condition may be a stromal disease, the tumor being the ensuing result. The lesions resembled those produced after experimental inoculation of polyoma virus into newborn mice. These animals received no injection of virus, and the spontaneous polyoma infection does not produce any tumors. The widespread deposits of Fe in the RES [reticulo-endothelial system] may have damaged the immunological capacity of these cells, producing loci of resistance towards the virus. The RES should have been damaged to such an extent that spontaneous infection or activation of latent virus would lead to tumor development. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19674800033783		
J	ZELL, C. A.								Rabies, Diagnosis and Treatment.								American Journal of Veterinary Medicine				10	11			835	836						1915, Nov	1915	The author has found that the complement fixation test can be used for the diagnosis of rabies if the antigen be prepared from the submaxillary glands of rabid dogs. The antigen is prepared by excising the glands, mincing them, and placing them in distilled water under a vacuum of 28 inches for at least an hour. The turbid liquid which is obtained is filtered through a Berkefeld filter. This antigen deteriorates rapidly, and it was found that an alcoholic extract made according to the Wassermann technique could be used equally well. In experimentally infected animals positive results were obtained several days before any symptoms were shown, the diagnosis being confirmed by the discovery of Negri bodies.On one occasion the author's attention was drawn to a case of rabies in a horse in a barn where fifty other horses were stalled. The animal was too violent to permit any blood being taken, but blood was obtained from all the other horses and five gave positive reactions. The team-mate of the horse killed, the team stalled next to it, and two other horses known to have been bitten by the rabid horse gave positive results. These animals were treated and remained healthy.With regard to the Pasteur treatment, the author's observations lead him to the conclusion that no antibodies can be demonstrated in the blood until three weeks after the completion of the treatment. This explains the occasional deaths occurring in people bitten about the face and neck.The author has produced an immune serum by hyperimmunisation against street virus. A number of guineapigs were treated with immune serum on three occasions. They were then inoculated after an interval of a week with virus, some being done subdurally, some intramuscularly, and some into the anterior chamber of the eye. The first group nearly all died of rabies, while the majority of the remainder proved to be immune.Guinea-pigs inoculated with rabies and then given injections of serum died if the interval elapsing between the inoculation with virus and the administration of serum was more than two days. The results obtained when the virus and serum were mixed were very similar to those obtained when the virus was given after the serum.The five horses referred to above which yielded positive results to the complement fixation test were treated with the author's protective serum.

Viral persistence in the central nervous system is accompanied by mononuclear infiltrates, activated monocytic/microglial cells and reactive astrocytes. The immune-mediated process was further characterized by expression analysis of allograft inflammatory factor-1 (AIF-1), a novel marker of monocyte/microglial activation and of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) between day 3 and day 50 post infection (p.i.). Potential neuroprotective effects of these cells were studied by the induction of haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a defensive molecule against oxidative stress in various brain insults. In BDV-infected rat brains, mononuclear infiltrates and AIF-1 expression increased up to day 28 p.i. During early time points p.i., AIF-1 expression was mainly found in inflammatory lesions and adjacent brain parenchyma. Already 24 days p.i., a widespread upregulation of AIF-1 was observed which declined only moderately beyond day 28 p.i. HO-1 induction was maximal between days 18 and 28 p.i. Increased amounts of GFAP-positive astrocytes were present beyond 24 days p.i. Viral antigen expression increased simultaneously to the inflammatory reaction and persisted up to 50 days p.i. Widespread upregulation of AIF-1 indicates an early, long-lasting microglial activation, which might be involved in the immunesurveillance of the immune-mediated inflammatory events. The early peak of HO-1 most likely represents a neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory response by invading monocytes, microglial cells and astrocytes during the formation of encephalitic lesions and acute viral replication.

Despite this, when we infected target cells, we found that the point mutant was able to sensitize them for lysis not only by cytotoxic T cells recognizing residues 50-58 (the in-frame portion), but also by CTL to epitopes which are downstream of the mutation (365-374 and 378-386). Furthermore. normal C57BL/6 mice can be primed with the frameshift NP to recognize the immunodominant Db-restricted epitope 366-374 (which is out of frame). Experiments in which the mutant gene product was processed in the endoplasmic reticulum of target cells suggested that the apparent suppression occured during polypeptide extension.

Control of natural sources and insect vectors is extremely difficult and its results are unreliable. Natural spread is restricted by the limited habitat of both reservoir animals and vectors. A regular increase of incidence in late summer with culmination in September and October is recorded. Experimental infections may be carried put with dilutions of 1: 10-6 of material from infected rabbits. Virus is detectable in cutaneous myxomas, lymph nodes and blood only.

In this study, we investigated the role of miR199a-5p in the regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity. Ad-anti-miR199a-5p adenoviruses were injected into male C57BL/6J WT mice fed a high-fat diet to inhibit miR199a-5p expression before the glucose levels and insulin resistance were assessed. Similarly, Ad-miR199a-5p adenoviruses were injected into male C57BL/6J WT mice to cause the overexpression of miR199a-5p. To investigate the roles of autophagy-related protein 14 (ATG14) and miR199a-5p in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, we injected Ad-miR199a-5p with or without Ad-ATG14 viruses into WT C57BL/6J mice before performing functional assays. Moreover, we infected HepG2 cells or primary hepatocytes with Ad-anti-miR199a-5p or Ad-miR199a-5p viruses to determine the effect of miR199a-5p on insulin resistance in vitro. Finally, we explored the clinical relevance of miR199a-5p by examining the expression level of miR199a-5p in liver samples derived from diabetes patients. We first demonstrated that knocking down miR199a-5p led to decreased glucose tolerance and clearance in vivo, whereas the overexpression of miR199a-5p had the opposite effect. We further identified ATG14 as the target of miR199a-5p, and ATG14 partially rescued miR199a- 5p-potentiated glucose and insulin tolerance. In addition, transmission electron microscopy data and western blot data regarding ATG14, LC3 and BECLIN1 illustrated that miR199a-5p regulates autophagy via ATG14. Knocking down miR199a-5p in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells suppressed the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor beta, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and protein kinase B, whereas the overexpression of miR199a-5p further potentiated their phosphorylation. Finally, we detected upregulated miR199a-5p levels, which were correlated with reduced ATG14 mRNA levels and downregulated autophagy in liver samples obtained from diabetes patients. Our study uncovered a novel biological role of miR199a-5p in the regulation of hepatic insulin sensitivity via ATG14-mediated autophagy.																					WOS:000427753100010	29540751

Cytological and cytochemical methods applied in the course of these studies permitted the observation of crystalline inclusions in nerve cells. The method is described. Comparison of results with those of previous researchers leads to the conclusion that the inclusions are basophilic and have a hexagonal profile. The achromatic inclusions resemble tactoids/albumin molecules with linear orientation/which are formed during the neutralization of proteids. It is obvious that individual nerve cells can be destroyed by achromatic inclusions just as by pyknosis of the nucleus and by rapid chromatolysis. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R.

Bulletin de la Societe de Pathologie Exotique				8	2			54	57						1915, February 10th	1915	In October 1915, the body of a freshly dead shrew, Crocidura murina, L., was found at Pnom-Penh, in the house of a Chinaman who had died of plague. A microscopic examination of the ganglia revealed numerous coccobacilli, morphologically identical with those of Yersin. They were also found in the liver and spleen and were about as plentiful in the blood as in a rat naturally infected with plague. A jelly, sown according to Veillon's method, produced a culture of bacilli indistinguishable from those of authentic plague. White mice and a guineapig were inoculated with these bacilli and succumbed I to septicaemia and congestion. The author's recall to France, owing to the war, interrupted the experiments, but it would appear that C. murina plays a role in plague dissemination similar to that of rats. Xenopsylla cheopis, Rothschild, was found on three of these shrews in even larger proportions than on rats captured in the same locality.																					CABI:19151000166

To model this, we infected postnatal day (P) 5-6 (equivalent to the perinatal period in humans) susceptible mice with a mammalian cell-propagated ZIKV clinical isolate from the Brazilian outbreak in 2015. All infected mice appeared normal up to 4 days post-intraperitoneal inoculation (dpi), but rapidly developed severe clinical signs at 5-6 dpi. All nervous tissue examined at 5/6 dpi appeared grossly normal. However, anti-ZIKV positive cells were observed in the optic nerve, brain, and spinal cord; predominantly in white matter. Co-labeling with cell type specific markers demonstrated oligodendrocytes and astrocytes support productive infection. Rarely, ZIKV positive neurons were observed. In spinal cord white matter, which we examined in detail, apoptotic cells were evident; the density of oligodendrocytes was significantly reduced; and there was localized microglial reactivity including expression of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Together, our observations demonstrate that a clinically relevant ZIKV isolate can directly impact oligodendrocytes. As primary oligodendrocyte cell death can lead later to secondary autoimmune demyelination, our observations may help explain neurodevelopmental delays in infants appearing asymptomatic at birth and commend lifetime surveillance.

Series B				36	9			681	90						1989-Nov	1989	Models for infecting mice with Influenza A-Virus (A/PR 8/34, H0N1) and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (serotype 9) were developed in Han: NMRI-mice. After infecting mice with sublethal doses of one of the infectious agents, or both together as a mixed infection, animals were subsequently exsanguinated and the lungs washed by bronchoalveolar lavage. Clinical symptoms were recorded daily, examination of lung lavage fluid and sera as well as histology of the lungs were done. An increase in mortality, weight reduction and total cell yield of lung lavage fluid was observed after mixed infection. Compared to mixed infections total protein content and elastase in sera and lung lavage fluid after singular ones were raised not as much. In lung lavage fluid the total cell yield was increased more marked. These alterations indicate a synergistic effect of viruses and bacteria, developed by mixed infection as well as a bacterial infection on top of a viral one. Histopathologically the lung alterations were found to depend on the infectious agent and the mode of infection.																					MEDLINE:2609806	2609806

Our goal has been to determine if leaky-late expression of VP5 is a requirement for a normal HSV infection. It had been shown previously that recombinant viruses in which the VP5 promoter was replaced with promoters of other kinetic classes (including a strict late promoter) exhibited no alterations in replication kinetics or virus yields in vitro. In contrast, here we report that alterations in pathogenesis were observed when these recombinants were analyzed by experimental infection of mice. Following intracranial inoculation, a recombinant expressing VP5 from a strict-late promoter (U(L)38) exhibited an increased 50% lethal dose and a 10-fold decrease in virus yields in the central nervous system, while a recombinant expressing VP5 from an early (dUTPase) or another leaky-late (VP16) promoter exhibited wild-type neurovirulence. Moreover, following infection of the footpad, changing the expression kinetics of VP5 from leaky-late to strict-late resulted in 100-fold-less virus in the spinal ganglia during the acute infection than produced by either the parent virus or the rescued virus. These data indicate that the precise timing of appearance of the major capsid protein plays a role in the pathogenesis of HSV infections and that changing the expression kinetics has different effects in different cell types and tissues.

It was found that the interaction of these drugs is additive. In addition, Stimforte inhibits infection caused by a strain of virus, which is highly resistant to acyclovir.When administered 24 hours prior to HIV-1 infection of human lymphoblastoid cells MT-4, Stimforte exhibited reliable antiretroviral activity best expressed during the early period of infection (the 3rd day). On the 6th day of observation the effect was almost completely lost. Combined use of Stimforte at a dose of 50-100 pg/ml with a subthreshold dose of retrovir (0.03 mu g/ml) had a synergistic antiviral effect.Thus, Stimforte, which exhibits, on the one hand, antiviral activity against viruses of different families and, on the other hand, the immunomodulatory properties, could be promising as an etiopathogenic tool in helping to normalize both nonspecific and specific immunity. It may be used simultaneously with etiotropic antiviral chemotherapy in treatment of generalized herpes infection in patients with immunodeficiency. Furthermore, Stimforte can be used in the case of development of drug resistance in HSV, in particular, in HIV-infected patients.																					BCI:BCI201800599973

These malignant cells accumulate in various organs including the liver, spleen and skin in addition to blood and lymph nodes. Although there have been several reports of animal models of HTLV-1 infection in which proviral distribution has been examined, clonal expansion of the experimentally infected host cells has not been extensively analyzed. Here we provide experimental evidence that clonal proliferation of the infected host cells occurs in the spleen for more than one year. During a 15 month period of persistent infection, two out of ten mice developed spontaneous tumors. Although the tumors were not ATL-like, cells exhibiting mono- or oligoclonal proliferation and having the same site of HTLV-1 integration were identified in tumor tissues as well as in the spleen. Quantitative analysis of the cells belonging to each cell clone suggested that these proliferating cell clones were associated with the tumors and that spontaneous tumor tissues might provide a suitable microenvironment for proliferation and accumulation of infected cell clones at the late stage of infection.

J	Kaisto, T; Metsikko, K								Distribution of the endoplasrnic reticulum and its relationship with the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal myofibers								EXPERIMENTAL CELL RESEARCH				289	1			47	57		10.1016/S0014-4827(03)00231-3				SEP 10 2003	2003	We have analyzed the distribution of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) within isolated rat skeletal muscle flexor digitorum brevis myofibers. Studies with confocal microscopy indicated that the resident ER proteins displayed a perinuclear and cross-striated distribution that extended over the I band areas. Interestingly, two discrete distribution patterns were observed when different receptor or viral marker proteins were blocked in the ER. Accordingly, the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein that lost its efficient export through the Golgi apparatus during myogenesis preferentially marked the A-I junctional areas. The proteins that retained their Golgi processing after myogenesis, on the contrary, concentrated around the myonuclei and over the Z lines. Furthermore, the ER exit site marker sec23 located to Z lines but not to A-I junctions. To analyze the ultrastructural organization of the ER, we infected myofibers with recombinant virus expressing KDEL-tagged peroxidase that is translocated into the ER. With transmission electron microscopy, peroxidase activity was found in perinuclear and Z line-flanking tubular structures, but also within the terminal cisternae of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The translocon-associated protein exhibited a similar localization. Taken together, the terminal cisternae contained unevenly distributed rough ER structures apparently lacking the export function. The exporting FR comprised perinuclear and Z line-flanking structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.																					WOS:000185167100005	12941603

Materials and Methods: We infected the colorectal cancer cell lines SW620 and KM12L4, in which p53 is mutated, with the replication-defective adenovirus Ad5/CMV/p53 to evaluate the effects of adenovirus-mediated wild-type p53 gene transfer: Gene transduction was measured by cytochemical staining of cells infected with the Ad5/CMV/beta-gal virus and expression of the wildtype p53 protein in these cells was demonstrated by immunoblotting. Results: Significant suppression of in vitro cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis (as measured by TUNEL assay labeling) were observed following Ad5/CMV/p53 infection. Mole importantly, similar effects were observed in vivo in an established nude mouse subcutaneous tumor model; significant suppression of tumor growth (60% - 70%) and induction of apoptosis were observed following intratumoral injections of AdS/CMV/p53. Conclusion: This form of therapy may provide a novel approach to colorectal cancer.																					WOS:A1996WB83600009	9042200

Vector competence of two Indian populations of Culex quinquefasciatus (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes to three West Nile virus strains								JOURNAL OF VECTOR BORNE DISEASES				52	3			185	192						SEP 2015	2015	Background objectives: Culex quinquefasciatus is one of the principal vectors of West Nile virus (WNV). The mosquito also acts as a bridge vector as it feeds on both birds and humans. In the background of the recent reports of WNV activity in Kerala and Assam with fatalities, a study was initiated to determine the growth kinetics and transmission mechanisms of three strains of WNV in two populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus. Methods: Mosquitoes were infected by oral feeding and growth on different post-infection days was determined with the three strains. Horizontal transmission was determined by confirming sickness and mortality in infant mice after infected mosquito bite. F1 generation eggs, larvae, pupae and adults of experimentally infected mosquitoes were screened for WNV to determine vertical (transovarial) transmission. Trans-stadial transmission was determined by detecting WNV in adult mosquitoes emerged from infected larvae. Results: Both the mosquito populations replicated and maintained WNV for a prolonged period with high titers (>= 5log10 PFU/ml). WNV could be detected in saliva from Days 2 to 32 post-infection. Horizontal transmission by both the populations could be established but no vertical transmission was observed. However, parenterally infected larvae transmitted WNV to adults. Interpretation conclusion: WNV has been isolated from > 10 mosquito species from India, however, vector competence of none of the species has been studied. The present study demonstrates efficient transmission of WNV by Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. With its country wide prevalence and high vector competence, the mosquitoes could create grave consequences especially when virulent strains with potential to cause acute flaccid paralysis and death are circulating.

INVESTIGATIONS WITH A VIRUS STRAIN NONLETHAL AFTER PERIPHERAL INFECTION								Journal of General Virology				63	2			315	324						1982	1982	The herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) strain ANG, unlike the majority of HSV-1 isolates, does not cause lethal encephalitis in various inbred mouse strains, when applied in doses up to 2 .times. 107 plaque-forming units i.p., i.v., intravaginallly, orally, or via the foot pads. The progress of infection by this non-lethal strain and by a lethal HSV-1 strain, and the components of the host defence mechanism involved were studied and compared. If injected intracerebrally, HSV-1 ANG replicated efficiently in mouse brain cells and led to encephalitis. Upon systemic or peripheral infection, it replicated in several mouse organs with a virulence similar to lethal HSV-1 isolates. It was clear that transport of HSV-1 ANG to the CNS or replication in CNS tissue is efficiently restricted after peripheral infection. Infection with lethal HSV-1 strains appears to proceed in 2 distinct steps, virus replication at the site of infection and in the spleen and, secondly, transport to CNS tissue and propagation in CNS cells. This 2nd step is apparently blocked in infections of DBA/2 mice by HSV-1 ANG and can thus be studied separately. The blocking mechanism was not a function of interferon induction or sensitivity, nor was it due to an enhanced natural killer cell activation. Experiments with silica-treated mice, and with homozygous nude mice, which lacked T lymphocytes, suggested that the observed restriction in virus transfer is independent of T cell and macrophage functions. Yet, newborn mice were fully susceptible to i.p. infection with HSV-1 ANG, suggesting that age-dependent defense mechanisms, the nature of which needs to be further examined, are of relevance in the restriction of peripheral infection by HSV-1 ANG in adult mice.

Evaluation of the human adaptation of influenza A/H7N9 virus in PB2 protein using human and swine respiratory tract explant cultures								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				6						35401	10.1038/srep35401				OCT 14 2016	2016	Novel avian H7N9 virus emerged in China in 2013 resulting in a case fatality rate of around 39% and continues to pose zoonotic and pandemic risk. Amino acid substitutions in PB2 protein were shown to influence the pathogenicity and transmissibility of H7N9 following experimental infection of ferrets and mice. In this study, we evaluated the role of amino acid substitution PB2-627K or compensatory changes at PB2-591K and PB2-701N, on the tropism and replication competence of H7N9 viruses for human and swine respiratory tracts using ex vivo organ explant cultures. Recombinant viruses of A/Shanghai/2/2013 (rgH7N9) and its mutants with PB2-K627E, PB2-K627E + Q591K and PB2-K627E + D701N were generated by plasmid-based reverse genetics. PB2-E627K was essential for efficient replication of rgH7N9 in ex vivo cultures of human and swine respiratory tracts. Mutant rgPB2-K627E + D701N replicated better than rgPB2-K627E in human lung but not as well as rgH7N9 virus. The rgPB2-K627E mutant failed to replicate in human type I-like pneumocytes (ATI) and peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (PM phi) at 37 degrees C while the compensatory mutant rgPB2-K627E + Q591K and rgPB2-K627E + D701N had partly restored replication competence in PM phi. Our results demonstrate that PB2-E627K was important for efficient replication of influenza H7N9 in both human and swine respiratory tracts.																					WOS:000385306400001	27739468

In this study, we infected female C57/BL6 mice intranasally with mouse-adapted H3N2/Hong Kong/X31 avian influenza A virus, and then analyzed the gene expression profiles in four different compartments (blood, lung, mediastinal lymph nodes, and spleen) over 11 consecutive days post infection. These data were analyzed by an advanced statistical procedure based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling. Vastly different lists of significant genes were identified by the same statistical procedure in each compartment. Only 11 of them are significant in all four compartments. We classified significant genes in each compartment into co-expressed modules based on temporal expression patterns. We then performed functional enrichment analysis on these co-expression modules and identified significant pathway and functional motifs. Finally, we used an ODE based model to reconstruct gene regulatory network (GRN) for each compartment and studied their network properties.																					WOS:000362170700013	26413862

Role of Verrallina funerea (Diptera : Culicidae) in transmission of Barmah Forest virus and Ross River virus in coastal areas of eastern Australia								JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY				43	6			1239	1247		10.1603/0022-2585(2006)43[1239:ROVFDC]2.0.CO;2				NOV 2006	2006	Verrallina funerea (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) is a brackish water mosquito species found most commonly in Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the northeastern coastal regions of Australia. Aspects of the vector competence of this species for Barmah Forest virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, BFV) and Ross River virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, RRV), two medically important arboviruses in Australia, were investigated. Laboratory-reared Ve. funerea were moderately susceptible to experimental infection with BFV (median cell culture infectious dose of 10(3.6) per mosquito) and were capable of transmission to suckling mice (52% after a 9-12-d extrinsic incubation period). Maximum salivary gland infections for BFV (65%) and RRV (50%) were observed 8 and 10 d postinfection, respectively. To examine any regional differences in vector competence, field populations (separated by up to 200 km) of Ve. funerea and Aedes vigilax (Skuse) from southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales were fed BFV and RRV, and subsequent infection rates were compared. For both viruses, no statistically significant variations in body, disseminated, or salivary gland infection rates were found in either Ve. funerea or Ae. vigilax. The results from this study indicate that Ve. funerea may have an important role as an amplification vector during outbreaks of both viruses and that local government authorities should rapidly treat brackish water habitats to control this species during periods of increased disease activity.

Grossly, gray-white bulging foci and abscesses were distributed throughout the parenchyma of the lung. Pathologically, severe necrotizing lobar pneumonia with abscesses and fibrinous pleuritis were observed. Immunohistochemical analysis found accumulation of galectin-3 in alveolar macrophages and the alveolar interstitial region. No other viral or bacterial pathogens were detected in these animals. In addition, similar pathogenic changes and accumulation of galectin-3 were observed in the lungs of SD rats experimentally infected with C. kutscheri. Using northern blot analysis, the relative galectin-3 and GAPDH mRNA levels were 4.6 to 9.3 times higher in C. kutscheri-infected lung than in uninfected controls. These results demonstrate that a single C. kutscheri infection can induce the upregulation of galectin-3 in the lung and that this molecule may have an important pathogenic role in C. kutscheri infections in rats.

MJNV-infected Syrian hamsters, aged 21 days or less, exhibited reduced activity, weight loss, respiratory distress, hind-limb paralysis and seizures. Death ensued 1 to 6 days after onset of clinical disease. MJNV RNA was detected in brain and othermajor organs by RT-PCR and real time-PCR. Histopathological examination showed alveolar hemorrhage, interstitial pneumonia and severe pulmonary congestion; focal hepatic necrosis and portal inflammation; and acute meningoencephalitis. By immunohistochemistry, MJNV antigen was detected in pulmonarymicrovascular endothelial cells and glial cells. Older hamsters (35 and 56 days of age) developed subclinical infection without histopathological changes.

In 1985, Fishman (10) induced infection of the basal ganglia by a coronavirus in mice. Although coronavirus is recognized primarily as a respiratory pathogen in humans, its affinity for the basal ganglia led us to investigate its possible role in human Parkinson's disease. The cerebrospinal fluid of normal controls (CTL) (n = 18), and patients with Parkinson's disease (PD (n = 20) and other neurological disease (OND) (n = 29) was analyzed in a blinded manner by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [measurements in optical density (OD) units] for antibody response to four coronavirus antigens: mouse hepatitis virus JHM (J) and A59 (A), and human coronavirus 229E (E) and OC43 (O). When compared with CTL, PD patients had an elevated (p < 0.05) mean OD response to J (0.0856 vs. 0.0207) and A (0.1722 vs. 0.0636). Response (p > 0.05) to O (0.0839 vs. 0.0071) was greater than that to E (0.1261 vs. 0.0743). When compared to OND, PD patients had an elevated mean OD response to J (0.0856 vs. 0.0267, p < 0.05). Responses (p > 0.05) to A (0.1722 vs. 0.0929) and O (0.0839 vs. 0.0446) were greater than that to E (0.1261 vs. 0.0946).

J	BELLAMY, E. E.; EEEVES, W. C.; SORIVANI, E. P.								Under experimental conditions.								American Journal of Hygiene				67	1			90	100						1958	1958	Little is known of the survival of mosquito-borne viruses through periods adverse to transmission. In the first of these papers, an account is given of intensive studies of virus survival in winter, under natural conditions, begun in 1950 in Kern County, south-central California, a highly endemic area for western equine encephalitis (WEE) and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE). Collections of Culex tarsalis Coq., the chief vector, were made throughout the year from 1950 to 1955 in various resting sites in four localities in which the viruses reappeared regularly each summer with high infection rates in this mosquito. WEE virus was isolated from females collected in all months of the year except December and reached its peak of incidence in May-July. Strains isolated in January-March were often non-pathogenic for mice and produced little antibody response in inoculated chickens. The virus was isolated from three of four pools of C. tarsalis that had been collected in January-February 1954 and survived in a cellar until April. The monthly pattern of isolations showed close correlation with the feeding activities of C. tarsalis, and the virus could not be detected from 15th November to 15th January when blood feeding was minimal. Particularly high incidence of WEE infection in C. tarsalis in the spring of 1954 followed prolonged activity in the preceding summer but did not lead to a build-up of infection in mosquitos in the next summer. It is considered as likely that a vertebrate host is the immediate source of winter infection in mosquitos as that the virus survives solely in the vector in winter. SLE virus was found in C. tarsalis only in June-September, except for one finding in March. It predominated over WEE in August and September.The second paper is concerned with virus survival, under experimental conditions, and the following is based on the authors' summary of the results. WEE virus persisted in laboratory-infected females of C. tarsalis ai 550F. for 41 days after the mosquitos had reached the infective phase at 75-840F. Cinder similar circumstances, SLE virus persisted in C. pipiens pipiens L. : or 31 and in C. p. fatigans Wied. (quinquefasciatus, auct.) for 14 days. WEE virus survived for up to 113 days in experimentally infected females of C. tarsalis kept in winter in an unheated cellar, and SLE virus survived: or 116 days in C. p. fatigans under similar conditions. In a normal winter ,; emperatures in such cellars fell to 50-60°F. in January and February. C. tarsalis completed extrinsic incubation and transmitted WEE virus to chickens after 97 and 109 days of winter incubation. The infected chickens circulated virus in sufficient titre to infect normal females of G. tarsalis, and these in turn survived and retained WEE virus until early spring. It is concluded that experimentally infected females of G. tarsalis can carry WEE virus through the winter by serial transmission. However, the possibility that the virus overwinters in nature in a chronically infected avian host cannot be excluded. The data on the persistence of SLE virus were too limited for conclusive interpretation.																					CABI:19601000475

Zhongguo ji sheng chong xue yu ji sheng chong bing za zhi = Chinese journal of parasitology & parasitic diseases				23	2			93	6						2005-Apr-30	2005	OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of DNA/MVA combined immunization in enhancing antibody response to MSP1.METHODS: DNA vaccine and recombined MVA were constructed based on synthesized MSP1 gene (3D7). BALB/c mice were primed with DNA solely or together with GM-CSF expressing plasmid and then boosted with rMVA/ 190. Serum IgG and subtype IgG1 and IgG2a were assayed by ELISA. All mice were challenged with allelic replaced Plasmodium berghei.RESULTS: Antibodies to MSP1-190 were detected after DNA immunization with an end-point dilution titer of 1:2500. When GM-CSF plasmid was added, the antibody end-point dilution titer reached 1:11150, with an increase of 53 and 10 times respectively after MVA boosting. Among them anti-19000 antibodies were prominent, 1/4-1/3 of total IgG in serum. However, when the mice were challenged with Pb-PfM19 no prolonged survival was observed (P>0.05).CONCLUSION: High titer antibodies can be elicited in mice by using codon optimized MSPI gene and DNA/MVA combined immunization. The specificity and protection of these antibodies is being further investigated.																					MEDLINE:16042175	16042175

Though the river water is usually diluted with ground water the viruses of poliomyelitis are identified in the drinking water. Likewise epidemics of hepatitis are known to have been caused by infection of drinking water. The wastewater conditions of Hamburg are described as example for a big city. Though the identification of poliomyelitis in the drinking water has been questioned, the successful experimental infection of monkeys points to the occurrence of virulent viruses. The different results can be explained by the lower susceptibility of mice for this infection. Even chlorination of the drinking water is not sufficient for the destruction of the viruses of poliomyelitis and hepatitis. The individual strains behave quite differently towards Cl. Ozone is unfortunately too expensive. Filtration is also often insufficient. It is therefore necessary to take steps against the pollution of the water of the rivers. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19623800010880

Groups I and II were inoculated with 0.6*102 and 1.2*102 GE of swine hepatitis E virus (HEV) viral suspension (virus load: 102 GE/ml) via the caudal vein, respectively. The other 2 groups were administered with 0.6*102 and 1.2*102 GE via gastric perfusion, respectively. Control rats were given PBS according to the administration route of their group. Faecal and serum samples were collected before and after treatments for determination of HEV RNA using reverse transcriptase-nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-nPCR) and for anti-HEV antibody by ELISA. The liver tissues were examined by light and electron microscopy for pathological changes. Elevated ALT levels were observed 2 weeks postinfection in 4 rats with high-dose infection and 3 had slight inflammatory changes in liver tissue. The seroconversion of anti-HEV antibody was found in 1 rat. No abnormalities were observed in the other groups. HEV RNA was not detected in faeces and serum. In conclusion, high dosage inoculation of swine HEV could possibly cause cross species transmission to SD rats but with low susceptibility.																					CABI:20113073792		
J	STOCKMAN, S.; MINETT, F. C.								Researches on the virus of foot-and-mouth disease								JOUR COMP PATH AND THERAP				39	(1)			1	30						1926	1926	Nine strains of virus have been examined, all of the so-called O variety, except one of the A variety (Vallee). Applied intra-cutaneously all have been induced to take more or less readily in guinea-pigs and the disease in these animals has followed the course described by the German authors, Waldmann and Pape and others. Guinea-pigs may also be infected by the intramuscular, intravenous and intra-peritoneal routes but intracutaneous inoculation or scarification of the hind pads is more certain. Infection may also be established by rubbing the virus into the haired parts of. the body after a preliminary scarification. The disease does not spread naturally among guinea-pigs. Efforts to infect birds failed. Virus inoculated intramuscularly rapidly disappears but rarely it may be detected in the blood of fowls 48 hours later. When implanted into the skin of the claws, virus may be present for as long as 5 days. Most of the work was done with an O virus which had been adapted to the guinea-pig by repeated passages. While different samples of guinea-pig lymph from early vesicles vary in virus content, with this adapted strain filtrates were frequently active in dilutions of over 1 in 1,000,000. The simplest method of filtration is to use Seitz asbestos discs and with these adsorption is less than with Berkefeld filters. In 1 experiment the virus failed to pass a collodion filter. Concentration of filtrates by centrifugation at high speed failed. Some loose adsorption of the virus to kieselguhr was observed, but with red cells or staphylococci none could be detected. Much unsuccessful effort was expended in trying to confirm the findings of Dahmen relative to the artificial cultivation of the virus on solid media. In 1 instance survival at 34[degree]C. was prolonged to 44 days, possibly due to desiccation of residual traces of virus. Usually the virus did not survive on solid or in liquid media beyond 7 days and no method was found which markedly increased this period, although viability was promoted at temperatures between 0 and 37[degree]C. by the use of M/50 phosphate solutions at the optimum pH 7.5. Protective substances, such as gelatin, starch, agar, or gum, did not assist, nor did reduction of the air tension. No support was found for Dahmen's hypothesis that the destruction of the virus at body temperature is due to the presence of an inhibitory antibody in vesicle fluid. As with other viruses of this nature survival is considerably favored by low temperatures. Even repeated freezing and thawing for 124 days failed to destroy the virus in epithelial cells. Infected tissues can be conveniently stored in the cold in equal parts of glycerin and saline (at least 204 days); M/25 phosphate (pH 7.5) is even better than the saline. The virus resists such destructive agencies as ether, chloroform, alcohol, acetone and glycerin. Filtrates shaken with a few drops of chloroform at room temperature were still active after a month, while ethyl alcohol to 50% concentration failed to destroy the virus completely within 3-4 days. Saturation with neutral salts (NaCl, Na2SC4, MgSO4) does not destroy the virus; on the other hand, low concentrations (0.1-1%) of antiformin, of formalin and of certain metallic salts (CuSO4, AuCl2) are destructive. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: F.

Distinct neutralizing antibody correlates of protection among related Zika virus vaccines identify a role for antibody quality								SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE				12	547					eaaw9066	10.1126/scitranslmed.aaw9066				JUN 10 2020	2020	The emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas stimulated the development of multiple ZIKV vaccine candidates. We previously developed two related DNA vaccine candidates encoding ZIKV structural proteins that were immunogenic in animal models and humans. We sought to identify neutralizing antibody (NAb) properties induced by each vaccine that correlated with protection in nonhuman primates (NHPs). Despite eliciting equivalent NAb titers in NHPs, these vaccines were not equally protective. The transfer of equivalent titers of vaccine-elicited NAb into AG129 mice also revealed nonequivalent protection, indicating qualitative differences among antibodies (Abs) elicited by these vaccines. Both vaccines elicited Abs with similar binding titers against envelope protein monomers and those incorporated into virus-like particles, as well as a comparable capacity to orchestrate phagocytosis. Functional analysis of vaccine-elicited NAbs from NHPs and humans revealed a capacity to neutralize the structurally mature form of the ZIKV virion that varied in magnitude among vaccine candidates. Conversely, sensitivity to the virion maturation state was not a characteristic of NAbs induced by natural or experimental infection. Passive transfer experiments in mice revealed that neutralization of mature ZIKV virions more accurately predicts protection from ZIKV infection. These findings demonstrate that NAb correlates of protection may differ among vaccine antigens when assayed using standard neutralization platforms and suggest that measurements of Ab quality, including the capacity to neutralize mature virions, will be critical for defining correlates of ZIKV vaccine-induced immunity.

Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology				20	1			130	5						2004-Jan	2004	The gene encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-NJ) was subcloned from pMD-VN5, and inserted into pBAD/Thio TOPO vector. The recombinant plasmid was identified by restriction analysis and PCR. It was sequenced to confirm the correct sequences and the correct junctional orientations of the inserted N gene. The results of SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting revealed that the N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli LGM194 in a high level and the recombinant fusion protein, which contained a N-terminal HP-Thioredoxin and a C-terminal polyhistidine tag. It had a molecular mass of approximately 63.5 kD and immunologically reactive activity. The recombinant protein was characterized and tested in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) format for potential application in the serodiagnosis of vesicular stomatitis using 186 serum samples from experimentally infected goats and guinea-pigs with VSV-NJ and VSV-IN, and from field origin and reference serum samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA were compared with those of the standard microtiter serum neutralization (MTSN) tests. The ELISA and MTSN test results were highly correlated for detection of VSV antibodies. The ELISA was as sensitive as the SN assay in detecting positive serum to VSV. The correlation between SN titers and ELISA titers was statistically significant. These data suggest that the recombinant fusion N protein of VSV could be used as a recombinant test antigen for the serodiagnosis of vesicular stomatitis. The ELISA based on the reconmbinant nucleocapsid protein may offer the best combination of rapidity, sensitivity, simplicity, economy, and laboratory biosafety of any of the methods yet developed for VSV serodiagnosis. This study lay on foundation for the development of the diagnosis methods in serology for VSV.																					MEDLINE:16108504	16108504

Fabian; Kai, Chieko								The Nonstructural Proteins of Nipah Virus Play a Key Role in Pathogenicity in Experimentally Infected Animals								PLOS ONE				5	9					e12709	10.1371/journal.pone.0012709				SEP 15 2010	2010	Nipah virus (NiV) P gene encodes P protein and three accessory proteins (V, C and W). It has been reported that all four P gene products have IFN antagonist activity when the proteins were transiently expressed. However, the role of those accessory proteins in natural infection with NiV remains unknown. We generated recombinant NiVs lacking V, C or W protein, rNiV(V-), rNiV(C-), and rNiV(W-), respectively, to analyze the functions of these proteins in infected cells and the implications in in vivo pathogenicity. All the recombinants grew well in cell culture, although the maximum titers of rNiV(V-) and rNiV(C-) were lower than the other recombinants. The rNiV(V-), rNiV(C-) and rNiV(W-) suppressed the IFN response as well as the parental rNiV, thereby indicating that the lack of each accessory protein does not significantly affect the inhibition of IFN signaling in infected cells. In experimentally infected golden hamsters, rNiV(V-) and rNiV(C-) but not the rNiV(W-) virus showed a significant reduction in virulence. These results suggest that V and C proteins play key roles in NiV pathogenicity, and the roles are independent of their IFN-antagonist activity. This is the first report that identifies the molecular determinants of NiV in pathogenicity in vivo.																					WOS:000281815800009	20856799

Indian Journal of Animal Health				16	2			165	170						1977	1977	Efficacy of non-specific immunogen (trypsinised Mycobacterium phlei) preparation in inducing resistance against rabies virus in the rabbit at single multiple inoculation was studied and compared with that of specific immunogen (heat-inactivated infected rabbit brain). Single inoculation of non-specific immunogen induced better resistance as judged by serum neutralization test. However, less neutralizing substances were induced by the non-specific immunogen than by specific immunogen after multiple inoculations. The virulent challenge revealed that the non-specific immunogen afforded better protection than the specific immunogen. Treatment of rabbits experimentally infected with rat intramuscular challenge virus strain with non-specific immunogen was studied and compared with that of commercial 5% Semple's vaccine. Treatment with non-specific immunogen showed more than 57% survival.																					CABI:19782203696

Recently, previous studies have demonstrated immune stimulation and an antitumor effect of the high molecular mass gamma-PGA using various mouse models although these effects have not been shown in other species of animals. Therefore, the current study was conducted to determine the effect of gamma-PGA in pigs with and without PRRSV infection. PRRS-negative pigs were intramuscularly injected with 1, 3, or 5 ml of 20 mg/mll gamma-PGA, and one group of pigs served as a non-treatment (NT) group. All groups treated with gamma-PGA had signifi cantly higher weight gains, and pigs treated with 5 ml of.-PGA exhibited higher tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-alpha and IFN-beta expression levels compared with the NT group. According to the preliminary results, an animal challenge study was conducted with a highly virulent PRRSV strain, MN184, along with gamma-PGA treatment at different time points. Pigs treated with.-PGA had lower levels of viral loads in the sera and in lungs and gained signifi cantly more weight (p< 0.05) compared with the NT group after being challenged with MN184. Moreover, gamma-PGA-treatment groups had higher levels of neutralizing antibodies and cytokines related to proinfl ammatory, humoral and cell-mediated responses than the control group after the PRRSV challenge. Therefore, it was concluded that gamma-PGA induces higher levels of immune responses and increases resistance to PRRSV infection in pigs.																					WOS:000406311800002

The nucleocapsid (N) protein-encoding sequence of SEOV (strain 80-39) was RT-PCR-amplified and cloned into a yeast expression vector containing a galactose-inducible promoter. A survey of the pattern of synonymous codon preferences for a total of 22 N protein-encoding hantavirus genes including 13 of SEOV strains revealed that there is minor variation in codon usage by the same gene in different viral genomes. Introduction of the expression plasmid into yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae resulted in the high-level expression of a hexahistidine-tagged N protein derivative. The nickel-chelation chromatography purified, yeast-expressed SEOV N protein reacted in the immunoblot with a SEOV-specific monoclonal antibody and certain HTNV- and PUUV-cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. The immunization of a rabbit with the recombinant N protein resulted in the induction of a high-titered antibody response. In ELISA studies, the N protein was able to detect antibodies in sera of experimentally infected laboratory rats and in human anti-hantavirus-positive sera or serum pools of patients from different geographical origin. The yeast-expressed SEOV N protein represents a promising antigen for development of diagnostic tools in serology, sero prevalence studies and vaccine development.

J	FAZEKAS DE ST. GROTH, S.; DONNELLEY, M.								Studies in experimental immunology of influenza. III. The antibody response.								Australian Journal of Experimental Biology and Medical Science				28				45	60						1960	1960	The antibody response of mice receiving graded doses of influenza virus (live or inactivated by formaldehyde or heat) was studied. Sera and bronchial washings were titraed daily for three weeks following the administration of virus by the nasal, peritoneal or subcutaneous route. The ratio of antibody contained in the circulation and at the site of virtual infection is expressed by the " antibody distribuion coefficient ": 100 x bronchial antibody/serum antibody.After experimental infection (nasal instillation of live virus) anti-haemagglutinin is first detectable on the seventh day. Maximum antibody levels are reached round the twelfth day, and at the end of the third week there is already a noticeable drop in titres. The serological response is practically uniform in all survivors from infections with 0.1 to 100, 000 ID50. The amount of antibody free in the bronchi is on the average 5 p.c. of that contained in the serum. (Distribution coefficient = 5.1 + 0.41.)Three days after peritoneal and five days after subcutaneous administration of live virus anti-haemagglutinin is detectable in the circulation, but only after a lag of 4-5 days in the respiratory tract. Maximum titres are reached between the tenth and twelfth days. The serological response is proportional to the immunizing dose; to produce identical serum titres approximately 105-106 times more virus is needed by these routes than when given nasally. Only 1/250 of the antibody is free in the respiratory tract (distribution coefficient = 0.4 0.07); the distribution is independent of the absolute amount of antibody present.After nasal vaccination with inactivated virus, anti-haemagglutinin appears in the circulation on the 5-6th days, and reaches its maximum before the end of the second week. Roughly ten times more killed virus is needed to produce identical titres by this route than by the peritoneal. The antibody distribution coefficients are high: 5.2 0.33 for formolized and 4.5 0.17 for heated vaccines.Inactivated virus given peritoneally elicits the same response as the same amount of live virus given by the same route. The distribution coefficient is 0.4 0.06 for both types of killed vaccine.Complement-fixing antibody ("anti-S30") is detectable only after experimental infection of mice, the time curves and the distribution coefficients showing the same trend as the anti-haemagglutinin of the respective groups. No complement-fixing antibody is produced after peritoneal or subcutaneous administration of live virus, or after vaccination with killed virus by any of the three routes.Quantitative and qualitative aspects of the immunization process are discussed in the light of these findings, and the importance of the route of entry of the immunizing antigen is emphasized. The conclusion is reached that the serum antibody level in itself is insufficient to describe the serological state of an individual, as it gives no information in regard to the concentration of antibody at the site of possible infection.

Diversity of the murine antibody response targeting influenza A(H1N1pdm09) hemagglutinin								VIROLOGY				458				114	124		10.1016/j.virol.2014.04.011				JUN 2014	2014	We infected mice with the 2009 influenza A pandemic virus (H1N1pdm09), boosted with an inactivated vaccine, and cloned immunoglobulins (Igs) from HA-specific B cells. Based on the redundancy in germline gene utilization, we inferred that between 72-130 unique IgH VDJ and 35 different IgL VJ combinations comprised the anti-HA recall response. The IgH VH1 and IgL VK14 variable gene families were employed most frequently. A representative panel of antibodies were cloned and expressed to confirm reactivity with H1N1pdm09 HA. The majority of the recombinant antibodies were of high avidity and capable of inhibiting H1N1pdm09 hemagglutination. Three of these antibodies were subtype-specific cross-reactive, binding to the HA of A/South Carolina/1/1918(H1N1), and one further reacted with A/swine/Iowa/15/1930(H1N1). These results help to define the genetic diversity of the influenza anti-HA antibody repertoire profile induced following infection and vaccination, which may facilitate the development of influenza vaccines that are more protective and broadly neutralizing.Importance: Protection against influenza viruses is mediated mainly by antibodies, and in most cases this antibody response is narrow, only providing protection against closely related viruses. In spite of this limited range of protection, recent findings indicate that individuals immune to one influenza virus may contain antibodies (generally a minority of the overall response) that are more broadly reactive. These findings have raised the possibility that influenza vaccines could induce a more broadly protective response, reducing the need for frequent vaccine strain changes. However, interpretation of these observations is hampered by the lack of quantitative characterization of the antibody repertoire. In this study, we used single-cell cloning of influenza HA-specific B cells to assess the diversity and nature of the antibody response to influenza hemagglutinin in mice. Our findings help to put bounds on the diversity of the anti-hemagglutinin antibody response, as well as characterizing the cross-reactivity, affinity, and molecular nature of the antibody response.

This is consistent with the important role that IFN-( is known to play in the development of TH1 responses. To determine whether these effects were entirely due to a lack of IFN-( signaling, we infected a series of 129SvEv mouse strains lacking the IFN-(( receptor (IFN-((?R-/-), the IFN-( receptor (IFN-(R-/-), or both IFN receptor chains (IFN-(((R-/-). We found severe eosinophilic lung disease in mice lacking both IFN receptors, but significantly smaller numbers of eosinophils in the lungs of infected IFN-(R-/- animals. These significant differences in pathology occurred despite the fact that both of these strains developed TH2 cytokine responses to RSV-F protein epitopes that elicited TH0 cytokines from immune wild type splenocytes. We have now shown that the extent of eosinophilic inflammation and IL-13 in the lung correlates directly with the presence or absence of IP-10, an IFN-stimulated gene. We conclude from these studies that although CD4+ TH2 cell differentiation occurs in absence of IFN-(, the presence of either an intact IFN-(( or IFN-? signaling pathway can inhibit the development of eosinophilic disease by IP-10 induction.

Symptoms of infection often include itching, numbness, or pain indicative of altered neurological function. To determine if there is an in vitro electrophysiological correlate to these characteristic in vivo symptoms, we infected cultured rat sympathetic neurons with well-characterized strains of PRV known to produce virulent or attenuated symptoms in animals. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made at various times after infection. By 8 hours of infection with virulent PRV, action potential (AP) firing rates increased substantially and were accompanied by hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials and spikelet-like events. Coincident with the increase in AP firing rate, adjacent neurons exhibited coupled firing events, first with AP-spikelets and later with near identical resting membrane potentials and AP firing. Small fusion pores between adjacent cell bodies formed early after infection as demonstrated by transfer of the low molecular weight dye, Lucifer Yellow. Later, larger pores formed as demonstrated by transfer of high molecular weight Texas red-dextran conjugates between infected cells. Further evidence for viral-induced fusion pores was obtained by infecting neurons with a viral mutant defective for glycoprotein B, a component of the viral membrane fusion complex. These infected neurons were essentially identical to mock infected neurons: no increased AP firing, no spikelet-like events, and no electrical or dye transfer. Infection with PRV Bartha, an attenuated circuit-tracing strain delayed, but did not eliminate the increased neuronal activity and coupling events. We suggest that formation of fusion pores between infected neurons results in electrical coupling and elevated firing rates, and that these processes may contribute to the altered neural function seen in PRV-infected animals.

In 2010, a disease outbreak was reported in Cadiz (Southern Spain) affecting game birds (red-legged partridges and common pheasants). In this work, red-legged partridges were inoculated experimentally with infectious BAGV isolated from this outbreak in order to make a complete clinical and analytical assessment of the disease caused by the pathogen in this species. Viral load (by real-time RT-PCR) in blood, oral and cloacal swabs, and feathers, and neutralizing antibody titres (by VNT) were measured. In order to determine direct contact transmission, non-inoculated partridges were caged together with the inoculated ones. To assess infectiousness in other species, house sparrows and mice were also inoculated with the virus. All the inoculated partridges were clinically affected, and 30% of them died. All the infected individuals lost weight, with larger losses being recorded in females. Conversely, no mortality or disease symptoms were observed in the sparrows or mice. Remarkably, all the contact partridges acquired the infection by direct (non-vectored) transmission. This study confirms that the red-legged partridge is a susceptible host for BAGV infection, and that this pathogen is transmitted by direct contact. Long-lasting viral loads detected in calami of immature feathers demonstrate that feather sampling could be a useful strategy in active surveillance programs for early detection of BAGV.

In this work, red-legged partridges were inoculated experimentally with infectious BAGV isolated from this outbreak in order to make a complete clinical and analytical assessment of the disease caused by the pathogen in this species. Viral load (by real-time RT-PCR) in blood, oral and cloacal swabs, and feathers, and neutralizing antibody titres (by VNT) were measured. In order to determine direct contact transmission, non-inoculated partridges were caged together with the inoculated ones. To assess infectiousness in other species, house sparrows and mice were also inoculated with the virus. All the inoculated partridges were clinically affected, and 30% of them died. All the infected individuals lost weight, with larger losses being recorded in females. Conversely, no mortality or disease symptoms were observed in the sparrows or mice. Remarkably, all the contact partridges acquired the infection by direct (non-vectored) transmission. This study confirms that the red-legged partridge is a susceptible host for BAGV infection, and that this pathogen is transmitted by direct contact. Long-lasting viral loads detected in calami of immature feathers demonstrate that feather sampling could be a useful strategy in active surveillance programs for early detection of BAGV.

J	Wu, Xiaorong; Zhou, Xiong; Hu, Yuxiang; Liu, Chao; Wang, Jun								Neutralization of nerve growth factor (NGF) inhibits the Th2 response and protects against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection								IMMUNOLOGIC RESEARCH				65	3			721	728		10.1007/s12026-017-8909-z				JUN 2017	2017	Increasing evidence suggests that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection during the early life is an important risk factor for the development of asthma. RSV infection is associated with neurogenic inflammation in the airways along with the increased expression of nerve growth factor (NGF). However, the role of NGF in RSV infection is not clear. In this study, we infected the rat with RSV and treated these animals with anti-NGF neutralization antibody. We found that anti-NGF treatment significantly alleviated the lung inflammation as evidenced by decreased inflammatory infiltration and decreased airway resistance. Importantly, anti-NGF treatment resulted in increased Th1, but decreased Th2 immune responses, and facilitated the viral control in the tissues and blood. Therefore, NGF inhibited Th2 but increased Th1 responses in RSV infection. Pharmacological intervention of NGF signaling during severe RSV infections could prevent or decrease further asthma symptoms.																					WOS:000401924400016	28258348

Each day a portion of the cortex of one animal was homogenized, fractionated into subcellular components, and titrated into mice. The virus could first be demonstrated in the cytoplasmic fraction on the 3d day; in the nuclear fraction on the 4th day. The titers were significantly higher (10-3.3 and 10-3.5) in the cytoplasmic fraction than in the nuclear fraction (10-1.6 to 10-1.7) during the 4th and 5th days, and approximately the same on the 6th day (10-3.8 and 10-3.4). Among the cytoplasmic fractions, differences in titer between mitochondria and microsomes were not significant. Virus was found in the soluble fraction only on the 6th day. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Emilio Weiss																					BCI:BCI19593300026634		
J	FAZEKAS de ST. GROTH, S.; DONNELLEY, MARGARET								Studies in experimental immunology of influenza. IV. The protective value of active immunization								AUSTRALIAN JOUR EXPTL BIOL AND MED SCI				28	(1)			61	75						1950	1950	Mice were immunized with graded doses of influenza virus vaccines (live or inactivated by formaldehyde or heat) by 3 routes (intra-nasal, peritoneal, subcut.). At the height of their serol. response the animals were tested for their resistance to exptl. infection with influenza virus type A and B. A new method was devised to assess quantitatively the protection afforded by immunization. Mild exptl. infection gives rise to an approx. 109-fold increase in specific resistance to re-infection with the homologous strain. Peritoneal vaccination with 200-300 agglutinating doses of live, formol- or heat-killed virus increases protection by the order of 1000, the same amt. of virus given subcut. by approx. 100. The resultant immunity is a direct function of the dose of virus given in the vaccine. There is no detectable difference in immunizing power of live or inactivated vaccines of identical hemagglutinin content when admn. by one of the extra- respiratory, routes. Given intranasally, inactive virus lacking enzyme activity (heated vaccines) provides better protection than an equivalent amt. of enzymically active killed vaccine (formolized virus). None of the vaccines, admd. by any of the routes used, affords any protection against infection by the heterologous type of virus. The results are correlated with the serol. findings at the day of challenging, and it is shown that resistance to infection varies independently from the serum antibody titers, but that there exists a strong positive correlation between the antihemagglutinin content of bronchial washings and the degree of specific immunity. On these grounds the use of the serum antibody level as the measure of susceptibility to infection is criticized, and the necessity of determining the antibody present at the site of possible infection stressed. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19502400036753	15420100

It targets cardiomyocytes through coxsackie and adenovirus receptor, which is highly expressed in the fetal heart. We hypothesized CVB3 can precipitate congenital heart defects when fetal infection occurs during critical window of gestation.Methods and ResultsWe infected C57Bl/6 pregnant mice with CVB3 during time points in early gestation (embryonic day [E] 5, E7, E9, and E11). We used different viral titers to examine possible dose-response relationship and assessed viral loads in various fetal organs. Provided viral exposure occurred between E7 and E9, we observed characteristic features of ventricular septal defect (33.6%), abnormal myocardial architecture resembling noncompaction (23.5%), and double-outlet right ventricle (4.4%) among 209 viable fetuses examined. We observed a direct relationship between viral titers and severity of congenital heart defects, with apparent predominance among female fetuses. Infected dams remained healthy; we did not observe any maternal heart or placental injury suggestive of direct viral effects on developing heart as likely cause of congenital heart defects. We examined signaling pathways in CVB3-exposed hearts using RNA sequencing, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Signaling proteins of the Hippo, tight junction, transforming growth factor-beta 1, and extracellular matrix proteins were the most highly enriched in CVB3-infected fetuses with ventricular septal defects. Moreover, cardiomyocyte proliferation was 50% lower in fetuses with ventricular septal defects compared with uninfected controls.ConclusionsWe conclude prenatal CVB3 infection induces congenital heart defects. Alterations in myocardial proliferate capacity and consequent changes in cardiac architecture and trabeculation appear to account for most of observed phenotypes.

Neutralizing anti-4-1BBL treatment improves cardiac function in viral myocarditis								LABORATORY INVESTIGATION				87	7			651	661		10.1038/labinvest.3700563				JUL 2007	2007	Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is the most common causative agent of infectious myocarditis. Chronic inflammation, loss of contractile tissue, and maladaptive remodeling all contribute to dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure. The 4-1BB receptor is a costimulatory molecule expressed by T cells and cardiomyocytes. We infected mice with CVB3 to examine if virus infection triggers 4-1BB activation and whether inhibition of this pathway will reduce inflammation and improve heart function. Echocardiography was performed on days 3, 9, 30 and at 10 weeks post-infection (pi) and ejection fraction (EF), left ventricular (LV) wall thickness, contractility, and internal cardiac dimensions were measured. At day 9, reduced rate of wall thickening (30 +/- 17 vs 70 +/- 19%), increased LV wall thickness (0.15 +/- 0.04 vs 0.09 +/- 0.01 cm in diastole and 0.19 +/- 0.04 vs 0.15 +/- 0.02 cm in systole), and reduced cardiac volume (0.013 +/- 0.004 vs 0.023 +/- 0.003 ml in diastole and 0.004 +/- 0.002 ml vs 0.007 +/- 0.001ml in systole) were observed in infected hearts as compared with shams. At 14 days pi, CVB3-infected mice were randomly assigned to receive either anti-4-1BBL neutralizing (M522) or control antibodies (Ab) for 8 weeks. Cardiac damage, fibrosis, and inflammation were assessed by histological stains and immunohistochemistry. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was utilized to detect matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 expressions. At 10 weeks pi, M522 treatment improved LV wall thickening rate (similar to 10 +/- 13 vs similar to 49 +/- 16%, expressed as percentage change from baseline) and reduced diastolic LV posterior wall thickness (17 +/- 10 vs 57 +/- 47%, expressed as percentage change from baseline), cardiac damage as assessed by histological scores (0 vs 1.371.5), fibrosis by collagen volume fraction (3.2 +/- 0.6 vs 4.9 +/- 2.2%), overall inflammation (5.9 +/- 1.3 vs 8.5 +/- 4.1%), and T-cell infiltration (1.3 +/- 0.9 vs 4.3 +/- 3.8%) as compared to control. MMP-12 was highly increased during acute and chronic myocarditis, but was significantly decreased by M522 treatment. Thus, long-term inhibition of the 4-1BB pathway reduces cardiac damage, remodeling, and inflammation during viral myocarditis.																					WOS:000247344700004	17468777

Neutralizing antibodies to Ad-36 are associated with obesity in humans. The metabolic and molecular mechanisms responsible for Ad-36-induced adipogenesis are unknown. As a potential adipogenic mechanism, this study examined if Ad-36 enhanced differentiation of preadipocytes.Research Methods and Procedures: To determine the suitability of 3T3-L1 cells (murine preadipocyte cell line) as a model, the first experiment determined if Ad-36 attaches and initiates replication in the cells. Next, effects of Ad-36 on the number of differentiated adipocytes, glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) levels, and cellular lipid accumulation were determined. The last experiment determined the effect of Ad-36 on human primary preadipocyte differentiation. Ad-2, a known nonadipogenic human adenovirus, was used as a negative control in these experiments.Results: Immunofluorescence studies showed adenoviral attachment to 3T3-L1 cells, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed expression of the Ad-36 EIA gene in the infected cells. Ad-36, but not Ad-2, increased the number of differentiated adipocytes, GPDH enzyme levels, and the total cellular lipid content. Also, Ad-36, but not Ad-2, increased GPDH levels in human preadipocytes.Discussion: Taken together, these experiments showed that Ad-36 enhanced differentiation of preadipocytes, which may be a contributory mechanism to its adipogenic effect in vivo. The lack of effect of Ad-2 on differentiation demonstrated that the observed findings were not a common characteristic of all adenoviruses. Future understanding of the molecular interactions of cellular and viral genes responsible for enhanced differentiation may reveal novel signaling pathways and controls of preadipocyte differentiation.

R	Croft, Nathan								Acute experimental infection of bats and ferrets with Hendra virus: insights into the early host response of the reservoir host and susceptible model species								PRIDE															2020-04-14	2020	Bats are the natural reservoir host for a number of zoonotic viruses, including Hendra virus (HeV) which causes severe clinical disease in humans and other susceptible hosts. Our understanding of the ability of bats to avoid clinical disease following infection with viruses such as HeV has come predominantly from in vitro studies focusing on innate immunity. Information on the early host response to infection in vivo is lacking and there is no comparative data on responses in bats compared with animals that succumb to disease. In this study, we examined the sites of HeV replication and the immune response of infected Australian black flying foxes and ferrets at 12, 36 and 60 hours post exposure (hpe). Viral antigen was detected at 60 hpe in bats and was confined to the lungs whereas in ferrets there was evidence of widespread viral RNA and antigen by 60 hpe. The mRNA expression of IFNs revealed antagonism of type I and III IFNs and a significant increase in the chemokine, CXCL10, in bat lung and spleen following infection. In ferrets, there was an increase in the transcription of IFN in the spleen following infection. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) on lung tissue from bats and ferrets was performed at 0 and 60 hpe to obtain a global overview of viral and host protein expression. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of immune pathways revealed that six pathways, including a number involved in cell mediated immunity were more likely to be upregulated in bat lung compared to ferrets. GO analysis also revealed enrichment of the type I IFN signaling pathway in bats and ferrets. This study contributes important comparative data on differences in the dissemination of HeV and the first to provide comparative data on the activation of immune pathways in bats and ferrets in vivo following infection.

Vaccination with a recombinant H7 hemagglutinin-based influenza virus vaccine induces broadly reactive antibodies in humans.								mSphere				2	6			e00502	17						2017	2017	Human influenza virus infections with avian subtype H7N9 viruses are a major public health concern and have encouraged the development of effective H7 prepandemic vaccines. In this study, baseline and postvaccination serum samples of individuals aged 18 years and older who received a recombinant H7 hemagglutinin vaccine with and without an oil-in-water emulsion (SE) adjuvant were analyzed using a panel of serological assays. While only a small proportion of individuals seroconverted to H7N9 as measured by the conventional hemagglutination inhibition assay, our data show strong induction of anti-H7 hemagglutinin antibodies as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, cross-reactive antibodies against phylogenetically distant group 2 hemagglutinins were induced, presumably targeting the conserved stalk domain of the hemagglutinin. Further analysis confirmed an induction of stalk-specific antibodies, suggesting that epitopes outside the classical antigenic sites are targeted by this vaccine in the context of preexisting immunity to related H3 hemagglutinin. Antibodies induced by H7 vaccination also showed functional activity in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reporter assays and microneutralization assays. Additionally, our data show that sera from hemagglutination inhibition seroconverters conferred protection in a passive serum transfer experiment against lethal H7N9 virus challenge in mice. Interestingly, sera from hemagglutination inhibition nonseroconverters also conferred partial protection in the lethal animal challenge model. In conclusion, while recombinant H7 vaccination fails to induce measurable levels of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in most subjects, this vaccination regime induces homosubtypic and heterosubtypic cross-reactive binding antibodies that are functional and partly protective in a murine passive transfer challenge model.

Infection-dependent phenotypes in MHC-congenic mice are not due to MHC: can we trust congenic animals?								BMC Immunology				5				1	7		10.1186/1471-2172-5-14				JUL 9 2004	2004	Background: Congenic strains of mice are assumed to differ only at a single gene or region of the genome. These mice have great importance in evaluating the function of genes. However, their utility depends on the maintenance of this true congenic nature. Although, accumulating evidence suggests that congenic strains suffer genetic divergence that could compromise interpretation of experimental results, this problem is usually ignored. During coinfection studies with Salmonella typhimurium and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-congenic mice, we conducted the proper F-2 controls and discovered significant differences between these F-2 animals and MHC-genotype-matched P-0 and F-1 animals in weight gain and pathogen load. To systematically evaluate the apparent non-MHC differences in these mice, we infected all three generations (P-0, F-1 and F-2) for 5 MHC genotypes (b/b,b/q and q/q as well as d/d, d/q, and q/q) with Salmonella and TMEV.Results: Infected P-0 MHC q/q congenic homozygotes lost significantly more weight (p = 0.02) and had significantly higher Salmonella (p < 0.01) and TMEV (p = 0.02) titers than the infected F-2 q/q homozygotes. Neither weight nor pathogen load differences were present in sham-infected controls.Conclusions: These data suggest that these strains differ for genes other than those in the MHC congenic region. The most likely explanation is that deleterious recessive mutations affecting response to infection have accumulated in the more than 40 years that this B10. Q-H-2(q) MHC-congenic strain has been separated from its B10-H-2(b) parental strain. During typical experiments with congenic strains, the phenotypes of these accumulated mutations will be falsely ascribed to the congenic gene(s). This problem likely affects any strains separated for appreciable time and while usually ignored, can be avoided with the use of F-2 segregants.																					BCI:BCI200600069450	15245582

Acute experimental infection of bats and ferrets with Hendra virus: Insights into the early host response of the reservoir host and susceptible model species								PLOS PATHOGENS				16	3					e1008412	10.1371/journal.ppat.1008412				MAR 2020	2020	Author summaryBats are natural reservoirs for a number of viruses, including HeV that cause severe disease in humans and other susceptible hosts. We examined acute HeV infection in pteropid bats, compared to ferrets, a species that develops fulminating disease following exposure to HeV, similar to humans. Analysis of HeV replication and transcription of innate immune genes was performed at 12, 36 and 60 hpe and global proteomics was performed on tissues at 60 hpe to obtain insight into the mechanisms responsible for innocuous (bats) compared to fatal (ferrets) HeV infection. We confirmed that both animal species had become infected on the basis of detection of viral RNA in bat lung (60 hpe) and ferret lung, lymph node, spleen, heart and intestine (36 and/or 60 hpe). Analysis of the transcription of IFNs and CXCL10, combined with global proteomics analysis revealed differences in the activation of the immune response between bats and ferrets, consistent with the difference in the control of viral replication and the development of pathology associated with disease between the two species. This study represents the first in vivo comparison between bats and a susceptible host and contributes important information on the kinetics and control of HeV in these two model species.Bats are the natural reservoir host for a number of zoonotic viruses, including Hendra virus (HeV) which causes severe clinical disease in humans and other susceptible hosts.

Haematology and serum biochemical changes in the experimental lineage 1 variant Pestes Des Petit Ruminants virus infection in goats.								Journal of Commonwealth Veterinary Association				27	2			126	132						2011	2011	This study describes the haematological and biochemical changes of goats experimentally infected with lineage 1 variant strain of Pestes Des Petit Ruminants (PPR) virus. Fifteen goats were infected intratracheally with 1 ml of the pure culture of PPR virus grown in Baby hamster kidney cell line with a titre of 106.5 TCID50. ANOVA using Duncan multiple range was used to test the significance of the means of the haematological and biochemical values. There was marked haemoconcentration evidenced by increased packed cell volume and haemoglobin concentration over the weeks during the infection. There was significant neutrophilic leucocytosis from the third week (P≤0.05) while there was an insignificant lymphopenia (P>0.05). There was oesinophilia and monocytosis from the fourth week postinfection. The increase in the albumin, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine and fibrinogen values from the second week post infection was significant (P≤0.05). The haemoconcentration may be related to the dehydration resulting from diarrhea. The transient lymphopenia observed between 10-14 dpi reflects the mild virulence of the PPR virus from the lineage 1 while the neutrophilia observed at the third week may be associated with the bacterial complication observed in the course of infection. The serum biochemistry revealed consistent increases in BUN, albumin and fibrinogen values which can be associated with the pattern of pneumonia observed. This study showed that PPR virus from the lineage 1 may be associated with bacterial complication in the later stages and the determination of fibrinogen levels could be of diagnostic value.

J	DARCEL, C								REFLECTIONS ON THE PATHOGENESIS OF DISEASES CAUSED BY THE ACUTE AVIAN LEUKOSIS/SARCOMA VIRUSES WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO AVIAN ERYTHROBLASTOSIS								VETERINARY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS				18	5			397	415		10.1007/BF01839290				OCT 1994	1994	The various diseases that follow experimental infection with the acute and non-acute avian oncoviruses are discussed with special reference to the pathogenesis of avian erythroblastosis. One view, based on in vitro studies, sees erythroblastosis as the product of a failure in the differentiation of virus-infected stem cells to mature erythrocytes, as a result of cell 'transformation'. The results of some in vivo studies, however, point to a resemblance of the disease to a haemolytic anaemia, where cellular death is an important component. It seems probable that the disease is the result of transformation of cells of the erythroblastic series followed by the death of many of these cells due to influences that have not yet been determined. Determination of the causes of this cellular death may prove to be as important for our understanding of the problem of leukaemia as the work that has already been accomplished in explaining the causes of cell transformation. It is also suggested that the tendency of gs amino acid sequences of the avian leukosis viruses and mouse leukaemia viruses to form fusion proteins with a variety of proto-oncogenes may be part of a wider phenomenon, and that these sequences may fuse with other proteins, altering their properties. More work is required on the possibility that there is an undiscovered immunological component in the progression of the L/S diseases.																					WOS:A1994PN39500008	7863611

The oral absorption properties were optimized by converting to the pyrazolo[1,5-a]-pyrimidine heterocycle, while potency, metabolic, and physicochemical properties were optimized by introducing the para-chloro and aminopyrrolidine groups. A mean EC50 = 0.43 nM was found toward a panel of 75 RSV A and B clinical isolates and dose-dependent antiviral efficacy in the cotton rat model of RSV infection. Oral bioavailability in preclinical species ranged from 46 to 100%, with evidence of efficient penetration into lung tissue. In healthy human volunteers experimentally infected with RSV, a potent antiviral effect was observed with a mean 4.2 log(10) reduction in peak viral load and a significant reduction in disease severity compared to placebo. In conclusion, a potent, once daily, oral RSV fusion inhibitor with the potential to treat RSV infection in infants and adults is reported.																					WOS:000351186700003	25574686	
J	Cavanagh, D								Coronaviruses in poultry and other birds								AVIAN PATHOLOGY				34	6			439	448		10.1080/03079450500367682				DEC 2005	2005	The number of avian species in which coronaviruses have been detected has doubled in the past couple of years. While the coronaviruses in these species have all been in coronavirus Group 3, as for the better known coronaviruses of the domestic fowl (infectious bronchitis virus [IBV], in Gallus gallus), turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), there is experimental evidence to suggest that birds are not limited to infection with Group 3 coronaviruses.In China coronaviruses have been isolated from peafowl (Pavo), guinea fowl (Numida meleagris; also isolated in Brazil), partridge (Alectoris) and also from a non-gallinaceous bird, the teal (Anas), all of which were being reared in the vicinity of domestic fowl. These viruses were closely related in genome organization and in gene sequences to IBV. Indeed, gene sequencing and experimental infection of chickens indicated that the peafowl isolate was the H120 IB vaccine strain, while the teal isolate was possibly a field strain of a nephropathogenic IBV. Thus the host range of IBV does extend beyond the chicken.Most recently, Group 3 coronaviruses have been detected in greylag goose (Anser anser), mallard duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and pigeon (Columbia livia). It is clear from the partial genome sequencing of these viruses that they are not IBV, as they have two additional small genes near the 3' end of the genome.Twenty years ago a coronavirus was isolated after inoculation of mice with tissue from the coastal shearwater (Puffinus puffinus). While it is not certain whether the virus was actually from the shearwater or from the mice, recent experiments have shown that bovine coronavirus (a Group 2 coronavirus) can infect and also cause enteric disease in turkeys.Experiments with some Group 1 coronaviruses (all from mammals, to date) have shown that they are not limited to replicating or causing disease in a single host. SARS-coronavirus has a wide host range. Clearly there is the potential for the emergence of new coronavirus diseases in domestic birds, from both avian and mammalian sources. Modest sequence conservation within gene 1 has enabled the design of oligonucleotide primers for use in diagnostic reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions, which will be useful for the detection of new coronaviruses.

J	BRUECHER J; DOMKE I; SCHROEDER C H; KIRCHNER H								EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION OF INBRED MICE WITH HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS 6. EFFECT OF INTERFERON ON IN-VITRO VIRUS REPLICATION IN MACROPHAGES								Archives of Virology				82	1-2			83	94						1984	1984	Peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of DBA/2 mice, after 7 days of in vitro preculture and consisting of virtually 100% macrophages, were able to support the replication of Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 strain WAL (HSV). Using a standard medium based on Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (D-MEM), no virus replication was observed in freshly isolated PEC. A medium based on RPMI 1640 consistently yielded higher virus titers in precultured PEC than the D-MEM medium and also allowed virus replication in freshly isolated PEC. Macrophages derived from the spleens or the bone marrow and precultured in the same way as PEC represented a highly pure population and were permissive for infection with HSV. Titers of .apprx. 106 PFU plaque-forming units] HSV were observed in PEC 48 h after infection with 103 or 106 PFU. Whereas a complete destruction of the cell monolayer was observed 24 h after infection with 106 PFU, complete cytopathogenicity in PEC infected with 103 PFU required at least twice this time. In the latter situation, plaque formation was observed 24 h after infection. PEC of different strains of mice were compared. Of these, PEC of all mice that are susceptible to HSV infection in vivo replicated HSV to the same degree as PEC of DBA/2 mice, whereas PEC of resistant C57BL/6 and C3H/HeJ mice produced 1000-fold lower titers of viral progeny. Whereas the number of infectious centers were equal in PEC of DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice, the plaques observed after infection of confluent PEC with a low MOI were considerably smaller in cells from C57BL/6 mice. Significantly higher titers of interferon were measured in the supernatants of HSV-infected C57BL/6 macrophages than in those of DBA/2 macrophages; the former were made fully susceptible by the in vitro addition of an anti-interferon serum.

J	Siva, AC; Bushman, F								Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 is not strictly required for infection of murine cells by retroviruses								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				76	23			11904	11910		10.1128/JVI.76.23.11904-11910.2002				DEC 2002	2002	The DNA-breaking and -joining steps initiating retroviral integration are well understood, but the later steps, thought to be carried out by cellular DNA repair enzymes, have not been fully characterized. Poly(ADPribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) has been proposed to play a role late during retroviral integration, because infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based vectors was reported to be strongly inhibited in PARP-1-deficient fibroblasts. PARP-1, a nuclear enzyme, binds tightly to nicked DNA and synthesizes poly(ADP-ribose) as an early response to DNA damage. To investigate the role of PARP-1 in retroviral integration, we infected wild-type and PARP-1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) separately with two HIV type 1-derived, vesicular stomatitis virus G-pseudotyped lentivirus vectors. Surprisingly, infection of both wild-type and PARP-1-deficient cells was observed with both vectors. Marker gene transduction and provirus formation by one vector was reduced by 45 to 75% compared to the wild type, but the other vector was unaffected by the PARP-1 mutant. In addition, PARP-1-deficient MEFs infected with Moloney murine leukemia virus showed no decrease in virus output after infection compared to the wild type. We conclude that PARP-1 cannot be strictly required for retroviral infection because replication steps, including integration, can proceed efficiently in its absence.

J	Macdonald, J; Tonry, J; Hall, RA; Williams, B; Palacios, G; Ashok, MS; Jabado, O; Clark, D; Tesh, RB; Briese, T; Lipkin, WI								NS1 protein secretion during the acute phase of West Nile virus infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				79	22			13924	13933		10.1128/JVI.79.22.13924-13933.2005				NOV 2005	2005	The West Nile virus (WNV) nonstructural protein NS1 is a protein of unknown function that is found within, associated with, and secreted from infected cells. We systematically investigated the kinetics of NS1 secretion in vitro and in vivo to determine the potential use of this protein as a diagnostic marker and to analyze NS1 secretion in relation to the infection cycle. A sensitive antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of WNW NS1 (polyclonal-ACE) was developed, as well as a capture ELISA for the specific detection of NS1 multimers (4G4-ACE). The 4G4-ACE detected native NS1 antigens at high sensitivity, whereas the polyclonal-ACE had a higher specificity for recombinant forms of the protein. Applying these assays we found that only a small fraction of intracellular NS1 is secreted and that secretion of NS1 in tissue culture is delayed compared to the release of virus particles. In experimentally infected hamsters, NS1 was detected in the serum between days 3 and 8 postinfection, peaking on day 5, the day prior to the onset of clinical disease; immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies were detected at low levels on day 5 postinfection. Although real-time PCR gave the earliest indication of infection (day 1), the diagnostic performance of the 4G4-ACE was comparable to that of real-time PCR during the time period when NS1 was secreted. Moreover, the 4G4-ACE was found to be superior in performance to both the IgM and plaque assays during this time period, suggesting that NS1 is a viable early diagnostic marker of WNV infection.

Type I interferon signaling is required for the APOBEC3/Rfv3-dependent neutralizing antibody response but not innate retrovirus restriction								RETROVIROLOGY				14						25	10.1186/s12977-017-0349-2				APR 17 2017	2017	Background: APOBEC3/Rfv3 restricts acute Friend retrovirus (FV) infection and promotes virus-specific neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses. Classical Rfv3 studies utilized FV stocks containing lactate-dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV), a potent type I interferon inducer. Previously, we showed that APOBEC3 is required for the anti-FV activity of exogenous IFN-alpha treatment. Thus, type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) signaling may be required for the APOBEC3/Rfv3 response.Results: To test if the APOBEC3/Rfv3 response is dependent on type I IFN signaling, we infected IFNAR knockout versus IFNAR/APOBEC3 double-knockout mice with FV/LDV or LDV-free FV, and evaluated acute FV infection and subsequent NAb titers. We show that LDV co-infection and type I IFN signaling are not required for innate APOBEC3-mediated restriction. By contrast, removal of LDV and/or type I IFN signaling abrogated the APOBEC3-dependent NAb response.Conclusions: APOBEC3 can restrict retroviruses in a type I IFN-independent manner in vivo. By contrast, the ability of APOBEC3 to promote NAb responses is type I IFN-dependent. These findings reveal novel insights on the interplay between type I IFNs and APOBEC3 in vivo that may have implications for augmenting antiretroviral NAb responses.

One of the most serious complications is postvaccinal encephalitis. The aim of this study was to identify early markers for vaccinia virus (VACV) induced encephalitis. For this purpose we infected mice intracranially with VACV-Lister or VACV-WR. Histopathological analysis showed that following infection with VACV-WR tissue damage in the brain spatially and temporally correlated with virus replication, infiltration of white blood cells and apoptosis. None of the above markers was observed upon infection with the vaccine strain Lister.MMP-9 is a serum factor known for its correlation to BBB integrity and encephalitis in humans. We found that in sera of VACV-Lister infected animals, MMP-9 levels did not change throughout the infection. However, during VACV-WR infection, in the first 2 days levels of MMP-9 were significantly low than the controls and subsequently rose to levels which were significantly higher than the controls. Elevated MMP-9 was associated with damage to the brain and to BBB integrity.In conclusion, efficient virus replication in the brain causes significant brain damage followed by BBB brake-down and release of MMP-9 to the serum, markers which were not observed when the attenuated strain was examined. Thus, we suggest MMP-9 as a possible non-invasive serum indicator for encephalitis caused by VACV virus.					46th Oholo Conference on the Challenge of Highly Pathogenic Microorganisms - Mechanisms of Virulence and Novel Medical Countermeasures46th Oholo Conference on the Challenge of Highly Pathogenic Microorganisms - Mechanisms of Virulence and Novel Medical Countermeasures	OCT 25-29, 2009OCT 25-29, 2009	Israel Inst Biol ResIsrael Inst Biol Res	Eilat, ISRAELEilat, ISRAEL													WOS:000322847000015

The surviving immunized animals had lower anti-hemagglutinin antibody titers compared to non-immunized mice. There was no difference in viral titers in lungs of immunized and non-immunized animals that succumbed to the infection. In order to try to increase immune system presentation of NP-protein-derived peptides, and thereby increase their immunogenicity, we constructed another vaccinia-based NP-expressing recombinant containing a rapid proteolysis signal covalently bound to the NP protein. This sequence, derived from the mouse ornithine decarboxylase gene has been shown to increase degradation of various proteins. However, we found that when used as part of a recombinant NP, this signal neither increased its proteolytic degradation, nor was it more efficient in the induction of a protective response against influenza infection.

Preclinical laboratory studies of the immunogenicity of the vaccine in linear and outbred mice showed that the preparation protects against experimental infection with the Rhinopneumonia virus by 88.8%, from the causative agents of Salmonella abortion and horse strangles by 100%. There were carried out clinical trials of a trivalent inactivated vaccine with a centrifuge strain Bacillus subtilis TNP-3 as an immunomodulator in order to specifically prevent salmonella abortion, rhinopneumonia and horse strangles. Clinical trials were carried out on horses in the Central regions of Yakutia. The business output of foals was 50.2% in the republic. The business yield in immunized mares was 76,0 % and in unvaccinated mares only 38,0 % in a controlled production trial at the "Uyruye" agricultural production complex. Consequently, immunization of mares with trivalent vaccine increased the reproduction rate by 38,0 %. Results of extensive production tests on 2,568 heads of herd horses confirmed the data of preclinical laboratory studies of immunogenicity in linear and outbred mice. The trivalent vaccine against rhinopneumonia, salmonella abortion and horse strangles stimulates immunobiological reactivity, induces the synthesis of specific antibodies in high titers and increases the business yield of foals from 18,0 to 38,0 %. The vaccine is highly effective and can provide recovery of disadvantaged settlements.			В табунном коневодстве вакцинопрофилактика является эффективным методом предупреждения инфекционных болезней лошадей. При смешанных инфекциях для профилактики заболевания животных в других отраслях животноводства используют ассоциированные вакцины. Нами разработана трехвалентная вакцина, изготовленная из штамма СВ/69 вируса ринопневмонии (ВИЭВ), штаммов бактерий Salmonella abortus equi БН-12 - возбудителя сальмонеллезного аборта и Streptococcus equi Н-34 - возбудителя мыта. Доклинческие лабораторные исследования иммуногенности вакцины на линейных и беспородных мышах показало, что препарат предохраняет от экспериментального заражения вирусом ринопневмонии на 88,8 %, от возбудителей сальмонеллезного аборта и мыта на 100 %. В целях специфической профилактики сальмонеллезого аборта, ринопневмонии и мыта лошадей проведены клинческие испытания трехвалентной инактивированой вакцины c фугатом штамма Bacillus Subtilis ТНП-3. Клинческие испытания проведены на лошадях Ценгральных районов Якутии. В 2011 г. по данным Департамента животноводства и племенного дела МСХ РС (Я) деловой выход жеребят на 100 голов кобыл в конных заводах и племенных репродукторах в среднем составлял 50,2 %. Для установления эпизоотической эффективности вакцину испытывали в одних и тех же хозяйствах республики в течение 2-4 лет. В контролируемом производственом испытании в СХПК "Уруйэ" деловой выход у иммунзированных кобыл составил 76,0 %, а у невакцинированных только 38,0 %. Следовательно, иммунизация кобыл трехвалентной вакциной повысила показатель воспроизводства на 38,0 %. Результаты широких производственных испытаний на 2568 голов табунных лошадей подтвердили данные доклинческих лабораторных исследованй иммуногенности на линейных и беспородных мышах. Трехвалентная вакцина против ринопневмонии, сальмонеллезного аборта и мыта стимулирует иммунобиологическую реактивность, индуцирует синтез специфических антител в высоких титрах и повышает деловой выход жеребят от 18,0 до 38,0 %. Вакцина обладает высокой эффективностью и может обеспечить оздоровление неблагополучных пунктов.																		RSCI:47419305

Using genetically diverse but fully inbred strains of mice it has been shown that host sequence variants have a strong influence on the severity of influenza A disease progression. In particular, C57BL/6J, the most widely used mouse strain in biomedical research, is comparatively resistant. In contrast, DBA/2J is highly susceptible.Results: To map regions of the genome responsible for differences in influenza susceptibility, we infected a family of 53 BXD-type lines derived from a cross between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains with influenza A virus (PR8, H1N1). We monitored body weight, survival, and mean time to death for 13 days after infection. Qivr5 (quantitative trait for influenza virus resistance on chromosome 5) was the largest and most significant QTL for weight loss. The effect of Qivr5 was detectable on day 2 post infection, but was most pronounced on days 5 and 6. Survival rate mapped to Qivr5, but additionally revealed a second significant locus on chromosome 19 (Qivr19). Analysis of mean time to death affirmed both Qivr5 and Qivr19. In addition, we observed several regions of the genome with suggestive linkage. There are potentially complex combinatorial interactions of the parental alleles among loci. Analysis of multiple gene expression data sets and sequence variants in these strains highlights about 30 strong candidate genes across all loci that may control influenza A susceptibility and resistance.Conclusions: We have mapped influenza susceptibility loci to chromosomes 2, 5, 16, 17, and 19. Body weight and survival loci have a time-dependent profile that presumably reflects the temporal dynamic of the response to infection. We highlight candidate genes in the respective intervals and review their possible biological function during infection.																					WOS:000310337700001	22905720

Blood				100	11 			5511	Abstract No. 5511						November 16, 2002	2002	We set up an efficient gene marking protocol to investigate the role of ex-vivo manipulated and transduced cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells to reconstitute the hematopoiesis of sublethally irradiated NOD/SCID mice. Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus-pseudotyped Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus retroviral vector, containing the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (LNGFR), was used to transduce CB CD34+ cells. We infected cells (sample A) with a cytokine cocktail composed by interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, Flt-3 ligand and thrombopoietin in serum-free medium (SF) on retronectine (RN) coated plates. Sample B represented cells cultured in SF in the presence of the above cocktail. Sample C represented cells treated on RN but not infected. At the end of transduction the percentage of LNGFR+/CD34+ cells was evaluated. Eight NOD/SCID mice were transplanted with 100,000 CD34+ cells manipulated or transduced. We transplanted 5 mice with sample A, 1 with sample B and 2 with sample C. Five weeks after transplant the bone marrow (BM) of mice was harvested and flow cytometric analysis was performed. In sample A 55% of the hCD34+ cells were LNGFR+. The median percentage of hCD45+ cells in the BM of sample A was 24 (range 21-34), 40 for sample B and 43, 34 for sample C. Within the hCD45+ gate, the median percentage of LNGFR+ cells for sample A was 9.3 (8.8-16). Within the hCD45+/LNGFR+ gate, the median percentages of hCD34+, hCD19, hCD13 and hCD41 were 2.5 (1.6-3.6), 14 (12-14.5), 2.7 (2.3-6.5) and 5 (3.7-9.4) respectively. BM cells from primary recipients were used for secondary transplant experiments and six weeks after transplant mice were sacrificed. In secondary recipients the median percentage of hCD45+ cells in the BM of sample A was 0.9 (range 0.6-2.5), 4 for sample B and 3.2, 3.3 for sample C. Within the hCD45+ gate, the median percentages of LNGFR+, hCD34+, hCD19 and hCD13 cells were 24 (11.6-40), 11.8 (3.6-12.6), 52 (48.4-84) and 6.3 (3.2-18.9) respectively. All mice were found to be engrafted with marked cells and BM harvested from primary recipients induced multilineage human engraftment in secondary recipients.

Influenza Infects Lung Microvascular Endothelium Leading to Microvascular Leak: Role of Apoptosis and Claudin-5								PLOS ONE				7	10					e47323	10.1371/journal.pone.0047323				OCT 24 2012	2012	Severe influenza infections are complicated by acute lung injury, a syndrome of pulmonary microvascular leak. The pathogenesis of this complication is unclear. We hypothesized that human influenza could directly infect the lung microvascular endothelium, leading to loss of endothelial barrier function. We infected human lung microvascular endothelium with both clinical and laboratory strains of human influenza. Permeability of endothelial monolayers was assessed by spectrofluorimetry and by measurement of the transendothelial electrical resistance. We determined the molecular mechanisms of flu-induced endothelial permeability and developed a mouse model of severe influenza. We found that both clinical and laboratory strains of human influenza can infect and replicate in human pulmonary microvascular endothelium, leading to a marked increase in permeability. This was caused by apoptosis of the lung endothelium, since inhibition of caspases greatly attenuated influenza-induced endothelial leak. Remarkably, replication-deficient virus also caused a significant degree of endothelial permeability, despite displaying no cytotoxic effects to the endothelium. Instead, replication-deficient virus induced degradation of the tight junction protein claudin-5; the adherens junction protein VE-cadherin and the actin cytoskeleton were unaffected. Over-expression of claudin-5 was sufficient to prevent replication-deficient virus-induced permeability. The barrier-protective agent formoterol was able to markedly attenuate flu-induced leak in association with dose-dependent induction of claudin-5. Finally, mice infected with human influenza developed pulmonary edema that was abrogated by parenteral treatment with formoterol. Thus, we describe two distinct mechanisms by which human influenza can induce pulmonary microvascular leak. Our findings have implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of acute lung injury from severe influenza.																					WOS:000310310200034	23115643

To determine whether T cells responding to influenza infection can interact with T cells responding to Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) infection and disrupt granuloma formation, we infected mice containing two monoclonal T cell populations specific for the model Ags pigeon cytochrome c (PCC) and hen egg lysozyme (HEL). These mice were chronically infected with PCC epitope-tagged BCG (PCC-BCG) and acutely infected with HEL epitope-tagged influenza virus (HEL-flu). In these mice, PCC-BCG infection is much more abundant in the liver than the lung, whereas HEL-flu infection is localized to the lung. We observe that both T cells have access to both inflammatory sites, but that PCC-specific T cells dominate the PCC-BCG inflammatory site in the liver, whereas HEL-specific T cells dominate the HEL-flu inflammatory site in the lung. Influenza infection, in the absence of an influenza-specific T cell response, is able to increase the activation state and IFN-gamma secretion of PCC-BCG-specific T cells in the granuloma. Activation of HEL-specific T cells allows them to secrete IFN-gamma and contribute to protection in the granuloma. Ultimately, infection with influenza has little effect on bacterial load, and bacteria do not disseminate. In summary, these data illustrate complex interactions between T cell responses to infectious agents that can affect effector responses to pathogens.

Two Sides of a Coin: a Zika Virus Mutation Selected in Pregnant Rhesus Macaques Promotes Fetal Infection in Mice but at a Cost of Reduced Fitness in Nonpregnant Macaques and Diminished Transmissibility by Vectors								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				94	24					e01605	10.1128/JVI.01605-20				DEC 2020	2020	Although fetal death is now understood to be a severe outcome of congenital Zika syndrome, the role of viral genetics is still unclear. We sequenced Zika virus (ZIKV) from a rhesus macaque fetus that died after inoculation and identified a single intrahost substitution, M1404I, in the ZIKV polyprotein, located in nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B). Targeted sequencing flanking position 1404 in 9 additional macaque mothers and their fetuses identified M1404I at a subconsensus frequency in the majority (5 of 9, 56%) of animals and some of their fetuses. Despite its repeated presence in pregnant macaques, M1404I has occurred rarely in humans since 2015. Since the primary ZIKV transmission cycle is human-mosquito-human, mutations in one host must be retained in the alternate host to be perpetuated. We hypothesized that ZIKV I1404 increases viral fitness in nonpregnant macaques and pregnant mice but is less efficiently transmitted by vectors, explaining its low frequency in humans during outbreaks. By examining competitive fitness relative to that of ZIKV M1404, we observed that ZIKV I1404 produced lower viremias in non pregnant macaques and was a weaker competitor in tissues. In pregnant wild-type mice, ZIKV I1404 increased the magnitude and rate of placental infection and conferred fetal infection, in contrast to ZIKV M1404, which was not detected in fetuses. Although infection and dissemination rates were not different, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes transmitted ZIKV I1404 more poorly than ZIKV M1404. Our data highlight the complexity of arbovirus mutation-fitness dynamics and suggest that intrahost ZIKV mutations capable of augmenting fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not necessarily spread efficiently via mosquitoes during epidemics.IMPORTANCE Although Zika virus infection of pregnant women can result in con genital Zika syndrome, the factors that cause the syndrome in some but not all infected mothers are still unclear. We identified a mutation that was present in some ZIKV genomes in experimentally inoculated pregnant rhesus macaques and their fetuses. Although we did not find an association between the presence of the mutation and fetal death, we performed additional studies with ZIKV with the mutation in nonpregnant macaques, pregnant mice, and mosquitoes. We observed that the mutation increased the ability of the virus to infect mouse fetuses but decreased its capacity to produce high levels of virus in the blood of nonpregnant macaques and to be transmitted by mosquitoes. This study shows that mutations in mosquito borne viruses like ZIKV that increase fitness in pregnant vertebrates may not spread in outbreaks when they compromise transmission via mosquitoes and fitness in nonpregnant hosts.

Adoptive transfer experiments were performed to investigate homing properties of T cells that infiltrate the brains of infected animals. Lymphocytes isolated from the brains of diseased rats were labelled with 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) and transferred into immunosuppressed infected recipients. In recipient rats displaying neurological disease, labeled lymphocytes were demonstrated in the vicinity of brain cell lesions, suggesting that the neuronal destruction was dependent on the presence of transferred lymphocytes. Furthermore, the presence of virus-specific cytotoxic T cells was scrutinized in secondary lymphatic tissue and the functional activity of lymphocytes isolated from spleens, cervical lymph nodes, and mesenteric lymph nodes of infected animals was tested immediately after isolation and after in vitro restimulation. The data presented here indicate that precursors of Borna disease virus (BDV)-specific CD8(+) T cells are present and cytotoxic activity was demonstrated after in vitro cocultivation with infected cells in cervical lymph nodes and spleens but not in mesenteric lymphoid tissue. Adoptive transfer of in vitro restimulated T cells induced alterations in BDV-infected, immunosuppressed rats that resemble the well-defined clinical symptoms and neuropathology of Borna disease. This report provides for the first time formal evidence that virus-specific cytotoxic T cells are primed in the periphery after BDV infection, a disease that exclusively manifests itself in the central nervous system.

Experimental flavivirus infections have previously demonstrated a persistent infection and, in this study, we investigated the persistence of ROCV infection in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). The hamsters were infected intraperitoneally with 9.8 LD50/0.02 mL of ROCV and later anaesthetised and sacrificed at various time points over a 120-day period to collect of blood, urine and organ samples. The viral titres were quantified by real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The specimens were used to infect Vero cells and ROCV antigens in the cells were detected by immunefluorescence assay. The levels of antibodies were determined by the haemagglutination inhibition technique. A histopathological examination was performed on the tissues by staining with haematoxylin-eosin and detecting viral antigens by immunohistochemistry (IHC). ROCV induced a strong immune response and was pathogenic in hamsters through neuroinvasion. ROCV was recovered from Vero cells exposed to samples from the viscera, brain, blood, serum and urine and was detected by qRT-PCR in the brain, liver and blood for three months after infection. ROCV induced histopathological changes and the expression of viral antigens, which were detected by IHC in the liver, kidney, lung and brain up to four months after infection. These findings show that ROCV is pathogenic to golden hamsters and has the capacity to cause persistent infection in animals after intraperitoneal infection.

We infected post-parturient AG129 murine dams deficient in type I and II interferon receptors with ZIKV. ZIKV RNA was detected in pup stomach milk clots (SMC) as early as 1 day post maternal infection (dpi) and persisted as late as 7 dpi. In mammary tissues, ZIKV replication was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in multiple cell types including cells morphologically consistent with myoepithelial cells. No mastitis was seen histopathologically. In the SMC and tissues of the nursing pups, no infectious virus was detected via focus forming assay. However, serial passages of fresh milk supernatant yielded infectious virus, and immunohistochemistry showed ZIKV replication protein associated with degraded cells in SMC. These results suggest that breast milk may contain infectious ZIKV. However, breast milk transmission (BMT) does not occur in this mouse strain that is highly sensitive to ZIKV infection. These results suggest a low risk for breast milk transmission of ZIKV, and provide a platform for investigating ZIKV entry into milk and mechanisms which may prevent or permit BMT.

Subversion of Pulmonary Dendritic Cell Function by Paramyxovirus Infections								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				182	5			3072	3083		10.4049/jimmunol.0802262				MAR 1 2009	2009	Lower respiratory tract infections caused by the paramyxoviruses human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are characterized by short-lasting virus-specific immunity and often long-term airway morbidity, both of which may be the result of alterations in the Ag-presenting function of the lung which follow these infections. In this study, we investigated whether hMPV and RSV experimental infections alter the phenotype and function of dendritic cell (DC) subsets that are recruited to the lung. Characterization of lung DC trafficking demonstrated a differential recruitment of plasmacytoid DC (pDC), conventional DC (cDC), and IFN-producing killer DC to the lung and draining lymph nodes after hMPV and RSV infection. In vitro infection of lung DC indicated that in pDC, production of IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and CCL5 was induced only by hMPV, whereas CCL3 and CCL4 were induced by both viruses. In cDC, a similar repertoire of cytokines was induced by hMPV and RSV, except for IFN-beta, which was not induced by RSV. The function of lung pDC was altered following hMPV or RSV infection in vivo, as we demonstrated a reduced capacity of lung pDC to produce IFN-alpha as well as other cytokines including IL-6, TNF-alpha, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4 in response to TLR9 stimulation. Moreover, we observed an impaired capacity of cDC from infected mice to present Ag to CD4(+) T cells, an effect that lasted beyond the acute phase of infection. Our findings suggest that acute paramyxovirus infections can alter the long-term immune function of pulmonary DC. The Journal of Immunology, 2009, 182: 3072-3083.

For assessment of virus-induced pathology 2 series of experiments were carried out. Electron microscopy, morphometric and histological methods, including by Nissl stain were used. LD dose, daily loss of body weight with access to the so-called "endpoint" determined previously. Experimental period from 48 hours to 12 days. It is shown that in n.vagus stem structures in the medulla oblongata (n. dorsalis, n. ambiguus) have the mosaic and the polymorphic nature of the changes - signs of influenza virus cytotropic effect, such as swelling, vacuolation, chromatolysis, less pyknosis and hyperchromatosis. In the period of the greatest weight loss and expressed endpoint irreversible changes in the stem structures associated with n. vagus - apoptotic nuclei and neurons massive edema, lipofuscin accumulation have taken place.

Interfering activity decisively decreases and ceases by further anticipation or delay in the administration of NDV and by a reduction in the relative amounts.

A.) were successively injected with virulent streptococcus cultures; subcutaneous and intraperito-neal administrations were used. These animals showed greater resistance than controls to experimental infection with streptococcus. Most of them showed the attraction of the streptococcus to the local reactive processes due to the vaccines (anachoresis). This attraction is not shown by local abscesses due to subcutaneous injection of turpentine. The lack of anachoresis in these cases is attributed to the toxic and antibacterial action of turpentine. The abscess from turpentine developed in 8-10 days; the nodule due to B. C. G., in 6. In the latter, formation of consistent walls occurs, encapsulating the caseous content; in the former, the pus content is delimited by very thin walls. Anachoresis is not identifiable with attraction of leucocytes; the 2 processes are not always contemporary. Anachoresis appears to be constituted of 2 consecutive phenomena: (1) attraction of virus into the local focus; (2) killing of the virus therein. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: M.

However, the specific host signaling pathways responsible for differences in susceptibility and neurologic morbidity have remained unknown. In a murine model of HSV encephalitis, we demonstrated that the choroid plexus (CP) is susceptible to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) early in infection of the newborn but not the adult brain. We confirmed susceptibility of the CP to HSV infection in a human case of newborn HSV encephalitis. We investigated components of the type I interferon (IFN) response in the murine brain that might account for differences in cell susceptibility and found that newborns have a dampened interferon response and significantly lower basal levels of the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptor (IFNAR) than do adults. To test the contribution of IFNAR to restricting infection from the CP, we infected IFNAR knockout (KO) adult mice, which showed restored CP susceptibility to HSV-1 infection in the adult. Furthermore, reduced IFNAR levels did not account for differences we found in the basal levels of several other innate signaling proteins in the wild-type newborn and the adult, including protein kinase R (PKR), that suggested specific regulation of innate immunity in the developing brain. Viral targeting of the CP, a region of the brain that plays a critical role in neurodevelopment, provides a link between newborn susceptibility to HSV and long-term neurologic morbidity among survivors of newborn HSV encephalitis.IMPORTANCE Compared to adults, newborns are significantly more susceptible to severe disease following HSV infection. Over half of newborn HSV infections result in disseminated disease or encephalitis, with long-term neurologic morbidity in 2/3 of encephalitis survivors. We investigated differences in host cell susceptibility between newborns and adults that contribute to severe central nervous system disease in the newborn. We found that, unlike the adult brain, the newborn choroid plexus (CP) was susceptible early in HSV-1 infection. We demonstrated that IFN-alpha/beta receptor levels are lower in the newborn brain than in the adult brain and that deletion of this receptor restores susceptibility of the CP in the adult brain. The CP serves as a barrier between the blood and the cerebrospinal fluid and plays a role in proper neurodevelopment. Susceptibility of the newborn choroid plexus to HSV-1 has important implications in viral spread to the brain and, also, in the neurologic morbidity following HSV encephalitis.

Pneumocystis carinii Causes a Distinctive Interstitial Pneumonia in Immunocompetent Laboratory Rats That Had Been Attributed to "Rat Respiratory Virus"								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				49	3			440	452		10.1177/0300985811432351				MAY 2012	2012	A prevalent and distinctive infectious interstitial pneumonia (IIP) of immunocompetent laboratory rats was suspected to be caused by a putative virus, termed rat respiratory virus, but this was never substantiated. To study this disease, 2 isolators were independently populated with rats from colonies with endemic disease, which was perpetuated by the regular addition of naive rats. After Pneumocystis was demonstrated by histopathology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the lungs of rats from both isolators and an earlier bedding transmission study, the relationship between Pneumocystis and IIP was explored further by analyzing specimens from 3 contact transmission experiments, diagnostic submissions, and barrier room breeding colonies, including 1 with and 49 without IIP. Quantitative (q) PCR and immunofluorescence assay only detected Pneumocystis infection and serum antibodies in rats from experiments or colonies in which IIP was diagnosed by histopathology. In immunocompetent hosts, the Pneumocystis concentration in lungs corresponded to the severity and prevalence of IIP; seroconversion occurred when IIP developed and was followed by the concurrent clearance of Pneumocystis from lungs and resolution of disease. Experimentally infected immunodeficient RNU rats, by contrast, did not seroconvert to Pneumocystis or recover from infection. qPCR found Pneumocystis at significantly higher concentrations and much more often in lungs than in bronchial and nasal washes and failed to detect Pneumocystis in oral swabs. The sequences of a mitochondrial ribosomal large-subunit gene region for Pneumocystis from 11 distinct IIP sources were all identical to that of P. carinii. These data provide substantial evidence that P. carinii causes IIP in immunocompetent rats.																					WOS:000303234900004	22308234

Significant reductions in pulmonary RSV titers, compared to pulmonary RSV titers in comparably treated control animals, were seen in cotton rats given 1-10 mg SP-303/kg/day intraperitoneally (i.p.) on days 1 through to 3, after experimental inoculation with RSV. The minimum efficacious dose of SP-303 against PIV3, when given i.p. for 3 days, was 3 mg/kg/day. Higher doses of SP-303 could not be given i.p., as doses greater-than-or-equal-to 30 mg/kg/day given once daily by this route for 3 or more consecutive days caused both significant weight loss and death in infected or uninfected animals. Although no toxicity was observed following oral administration of up to 270 mg of SP-303 daily for 3 days, this compound had variable antiviral activity when given by this route.

J	Shah, Keerti V; Dandawate, Chandu N; Bhatt, Pravin N								Kyasanur forest disease virus: viremia and challenge studies in monkeys with evidence of cross-protection by Langat virus infection.								F1000Research				1				61	61		10.12688/f1000research.1-61.v1				2012	2012	Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus (KFDV), discovered in 1957, is a member of the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) complex. Diseases caused by members of the TBEV complex occur in many parts of the world. KFDV produces a hemorrhagic fever in humans in South India and fatal illnesses in both species of monkeys in the area, the black faced langur (Presbytis entellus) and the bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata). Experimental infection of the langur and the bonnet macaque with early mouse passage KFDV strain P9605 resulted in a viremia of up to 11 days duration, peak viremia titers as high as 10 (9), and death in 82 = 100% of the animals. Prolonged passage of the KFDV strain P9605 in monkey kidney tissue culture resulted in a markedly reduced virulence of the virus for both species; peak viremia titers in monkeys decreased by 2.5 to 4.0 log LD 50 (p= 0.001), and the mortality decreased to 10% (p= 0.001). In challenge experiments, monkeys previously infected with tissue-culture-adapted KFDV, or with the related Langat virus from Malaysia, were fully protected against virulent KFDV. These studies in non-human primates lend support to the idea that a live virus vaccine from a member of the TBEV complex may be broadly protective against infections by other members of the TBEV complex.

Delayed angiopoietin-2 blockade reduces influenza-induced lung injury and improves survival in mice								PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS				9	21					e15081	10.14814/phy2.15081				NOV 2021	2021	Influenza remains a major cause of death and disability with limited treatment options. Studies of acute lung injury have identified angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) as a key prognostic marker and a potential mediator of Acute respiratory distress syndrome. However, the role of Ang-2 in viral pneumonia remains poorly defined. This study characterized the time course of lung Ang-2 expression in severe influenza pneumonia and tested the therapeutic potential of Ang-2 inhibition. We inoculated adult mice with influenza A (PR8 strain) and measured angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), Ang-2, and Tie2 expressions during the evolution of inflammatory lung injury over the first 7 days post-infection (dpi). We tested a peptide-antibody inhibitor of Ang-2, L1-7, administered at 2, 4, and 6 dpi and measured arterial oxygen saturation, survival, pulmonary edema, inflammatory cytokines, and viral load. Finally, we infected primary human alveolar type II epithelial (AT2) cells grown in air-liquid interface culture with influenza and measured Ang-2 RNA expression. Influenza caused severe lung injury between 5 and 7 dpi in association with increased Ang-2 lung RNA and a dramatic increase in Ang-2 protein in bronchoalveolar lavage. Inhibition of Ang-2 improved oxygenation and survival and reduced pulmonary edema and alveolar-capillary barrier permeability to protein without major effects on inflammation or viral load. Finally, influenza increased the expression of Ang-2 RNA in human AT2 cells. The increased Ang-2 levels in the airspaces during severe influenza pneumonia and the improvement in clinically relevant outcomes after Ang-2 antagonism suggest that the Ang-1/Ang-2 Tie-2 signaling axis is a promising therapeutic target in influenza and potentially other causes of viral pneumonia.

Severe inflammatory reactions lead to tissue destruction and finally to cortical brain atrophy. After experimental infection of the rat, intraparenchymal CD8(+) T cells, MHC class I Ags on Borna disease virus (BDV)-infected neurons, and numerous nerve cell lesions were present. Treatment of BDV-infected rats with the mAb OX-8 directed against CD8(+) cells inhibited the immunopathologic reactions and reduced MHC class I Ag expression. Neuronal lesions were minimal and no loss of brain substance could be observed. Because BDV has no acute cytopathic effects, we provide evidence that the presence of CD8(+) T cells within the brain parenchyma and the expression of MHC class I Ags on neurons play a major role for immunopathologic brain tissue destruction and virus-infected neurons in vivo can be destroyed by T cell-mediated cytotoxicity.

Boma disease virus (BDV) is a neurotropic, noncytopathic RNA virus.Materials and methods: In this study, we infected neonatal rats intracranially with BDV Hu-H1 and Strain V within 24 hours of birth. Psychological phenotypes were assessed using sucrose preference test, open field test, elevated plus maze test, and forced swim test. The protein expression of ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway was assessed by Western blotting of in vitro and in vivo samples.Results: Hu-H1-infected rats showed anxiety-like behavior 8 weeks postinfection while Strain V-infected rats demonstrated a certain abnormal behavior. Phosphorylated ERK1/2 was significantly upregulated in the hippocampi of Strain V- and Hu-H1-infected rats compared with control rats, indicating that Raf/MEIC/ERK signaling was activated.Conclusion: The data suggested that infection of neonatal rats with BDV Hu-H1 and Strain V caused behavioral abnormalities that shared common molecular pathways, providing preliminary evidences to investigate the underlying mechanisms of psychiatric disorders caused by BDV.

J	Houston, Elizabeth; Temeeyasen, Gun; Pineyro, Pablo Enrique								Comprehensive review on immunopathogenesis, diagnostic and epidemiology of Senecavirus A								VIRUS RESEARCH				286						198038	10.1016/j.virusres.2020.198038				SEP 2020	2020	Senecavirus A (SVA), formerly known as Seneca Valley virus, is a single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus in the family Picornaviridae. This virus has been associated with recent outbreaks of vesicular disease (SVA-VD) and epidemic transient neonatal losses (ETNL) in several swine-producing countries. The clinical manifestation of and lesion caused by SVA are indistinguishable from other vesicular diseases. Pathogenicity studies indicate that SVA could regulate the host innate immune response to facilitate virus replication and the spread of the virus to bystander cells. SVA infection can induce specific humoral and cellular responses that can be detected within the first week of infection. However, SVA seems to produce persistent infection, and the virus can be shed in oral fluids for a month and detected in tissues for approximately two months after experimental infection. SVA transmission could be horizontal or vertical in infected herds of swine, while positive animals can also remain subclinical. In addition, mice seem to act as reservoirs, and the virus can persist in feed and feed ingredients, increasing the risk of introduction into naive farms. Besides the pathological effects in swine, SVA possesses cytolytic activity, especially in neoplastic cells. Thus, SVA has been evaluated in phase II clinical trials as a virotherapy for neuroendocrine tumors. The goal of this review is summarize the current SVA-related research in pathogenesis, immunity, epidemiology and advances in diagnosis as well as discuses current challenges with subclinical/persistent presentation.

Material and methods. Experiments were carried out on out bred albino mice that were divided into 4 groups: 1) intact mice unexposed to heating; 2) those exposed to heating; 3) Hantavirusinfected animals unexposed to preheating; 4) those exposed to preheating. The animals in Groups 2-4 were long exposed to heat stress at a temperature of 30 degrees C for 3 hours during 3 days. Strain Aa 60343 (PM-79-95) of the Far East genovariant of Hantaan virus (the genus Hantavirus, family Bunyaviridae) from the collection of the G.P. Somov Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was used to induce infection. The animals in Groups 3 and 4 were intraperitoneally injected with 700 FFU of Hantavirus per mouse. Materials (lung, liver, kidney, and spleen) taken from Groups 2-4 animals were collected for histological examination on days 1, 3, 7 and 14 of observation. Results. The intact albino mice in Group 1 showed no histopathological changes in the organs. After heat exposure, Group 2 animals were found to have an immunomorphological response in the interstitial tissues of the lung, liver and kidney in partial lymphoid hypoplasia of the spleen. There were no signs of inapparent infection in the presence of marked immunomorphological changes in the organs in Group 3 of hantavirus-infected animals unexposed to preheating. In Group 4, those exposed to preheating exhibited dystrophic and destructive changes in the target organs (lungs, kidneys) in the presence of immunodeficiency manifestations of manifestations that were more pronounced in dead animals. Conclusion. In an unresponsive model (adult albino mice), Hantavirus infection caused only obvious immunomorphological changes in the organs. Prolonged preheat stress in the hantavirus-infected animals promoted inapparent infection and morphological manifestations of induced secondary immunodeficiency that was responsible for the manifestation of an infectious process in some animals.

Society for Neuroscience Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner				2002				Abstract No. 124.11	Abstract No. 124.11						2002	2002	Adult neurogenesis has been demonstrated in the hippocampal dentate gyrus of several mammalian species including humans. Although numerous studies have shown that proliferation of dentate granule cells (DGCs) can be upregulated by a variety of pertuberations (pharmacological, traumatic, etc.), the impact of viral infections has not been well studied. To examine this question we infected rats with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) at postnatal day 4. This infection causes a gradual loss of DGCs that continues to progress in adult animals after infectious virus becomes undetectable. Stereological cell counts performed 8 months after infection revealed that the loss of mature DGCs (1.16x106-uninfected, vs 4.72x105-infected), was accompanied by an 84.2% reduction in DGC proliferation as measured by BrdU uptake. To ascertain if the virus-associated decrement in DGC birth was reflected in a loss of pre-DGC progenitors, we identified neuronal progenitors by staining for Mash1. Mash1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is found in progenitor cells that have committed to a neuronal fate. We found a marked decrease in Mash1 labeled neuronal progenitor cells (87% and 83% decrease in the granule cell layer and hilus, respectively, relative to uninfected controls). Thus, neurogenesis is impaired in this model of chronic DGC loss, perhaps due to a virus-induced impoverishment of DGC neuronal progenitors. The LCMV model could be exploited to examine pathophysiological mechanisms of neurodegeneration, and to test pharmacological strategies aimed at increasing neurogenesis or rescuing multipotent progenitors.					32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience	November 02-07, 2002November 02-07, 2002	Society for NeuroscienceSociety for Neuroscience	Orlando, Florida, USAOrlando, Florida, USA													BCI:BCI200300269504

We have previously demonstrated that viral transfer of the wild-type (WT) CASQ2 gene prevents the development of CPVT2 in a genetically induced mouse model of the disease homozygous carrier of the R33Q mutation. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of the virally mediated gene therapy in cardiomyocytes (CMs) differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) obtained from a patient carrying the homozygous CASQ2-G112+5X mutation. To this end, we infected cells with an Adeno-Associated Viral vector serotype 9 (AAV9) encoding the human CASQ2 gene (AAV9-hCASQ2). Administration of the human WT CASQ2 gene was capable and sufficient to restore the physiological expression of calsequestrin-2 protein and to rescue functional defects of the patient-specific iPSC-derived CMs. Indeed, after viral gene transfer, we observed a remarkable decrease in the percentage of delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) developed by the diseased CMs upon adrenergic stimulation, the calcium transient amplitude was re-established and the density and duration of calcium sparks were normalized. We therefore demonstrate the efficacy of the AAV9-mediated gene replacement therapy for CPVT2 in a human cardiac-specific model system, supporting the view that the gene-therapy tested is curative in models with different human mutations of CPVT.

H3 and particularly H3N8 viruses, are highly adaptive since they are found in multiple avian and mammal hosts. H3N8 viruses have not been isolated yet from humans; however, a recent report showed that equine influenza A viruses (IAVs) can be isolated from pigs, although an established infection has not been observed thus far in this host. To gain insight into the possibility of H3N8 avian IAVs to cross the species barrier into pigs, in vitro experiments and an experimental infection in pigs with four H3N8 viruses from different origins (equine, canine, avian, and seal) were performed. As a positive control, an H3N2 swine influenza virus A was used. Although equine and canine viruses hardly replicated in the respiratory systems of pigs, avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Interestingly, antibodies against hemagglutinin could not be detected after infection by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test with avian and seal viruses. This phenomenon was observed not only in pigs but also in mice immunized with the same virus strains. Our data indicated that H3N8 IAVs from wild aquatic birds have the potential to cross the species barrier and establish successful infections in pigs that might spread unnoticed using the HAI test as diagnostic tool.IMPORTANCEAlthough natural infection of humans with an avian H3N8 influenza A virus has not yet been reported, this influenza A virus subtype has already crossed the species barrier. Therefore, we have examined the potential of H3N8 from canine, equine, avian, and seal origin to productively infect pigs. Our results demonstrated that avian and seal viruses replicated substantially and caused detectable lesions in inoculated pigs without previous adaptation. Surprisingly, we could not detect specific antibodies against hemagglutinin in any H3N8-infected pigs. Therefore, special attention should be focused toward viruses of the H3N8 subtype since they could behave as stealth viruses in pigs.																					WOS:000363467200002	26311894

The vaccine against EV-A71 could potentially prevent virus-induced neurological complications and mortalities occurring due to the high risk of poliomyelitis-like paralysis and fatal encephalitis. It is known that polysaccharide purified from Ganoderma lucidum (PS-G) can effectively modulate immune function. Here, we used PS-G as an adjuvant with the EV-A71 mucosal vaccine and studied its effects. Our data showed that PS-G-adjuvanted EV-A71 generated significantly better IgA and IgG in the serum, saliva, nasal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and feces. More importantly, these antibodies could neutralize the infectivity of EV-A71 (C2 genotype) and cross-neutralize the B4, B5, and C4 genotypes of EV-A71. In addition, more EV-A71-specific IgA- and IgG- secreting cells were observed with the used of a combination of EV-A71 and PS-G. Furthermore, T-cell proliferative responses and IFN-gamma and IL-17 secretions levels were notably increased in splenocytes when the EV-A71 vaccine contained PS-G. We also found that levels of IFN-gamma and IL-17 released in Peyer's patch cells were significantly increased in EV-A71, after it was combined with PS-G. We further demonstrated that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were able to generate IFN-gamma and IL-17 in the spleen. An easy-accessed model of hybrid hSCARB2(+)/(+)/stat-1(-)/(-) mice was used for EV-A71 infection and pathogenesis. We infected the mouse model with EV-A71, which was premixed with mouse sera immunized with the EV-A71 vaccine with or without PSG. Indeed, in the EV-A71 + PS-G group, the levels of VP1-specific RNA sequences in the brain, spinal cord, and muscle decreased significantly. Finally, hSCARB2-Tg mice immunized via the intranasal route with the PS-G-adjuvanted EV-A71 vaccine resisted a subsequent lethal oral EV-A71 challenge. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PS-G could potentially be used as an adjuvant for the EV-A71 mucosal vaccine.																					WOS:000576867300001	33117346

To evaluate the success of their transplantation into living animals, noninvasive imaging techniques that are able to track the distribution and fate of those cells would be useful. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of infecting rat MSCs with adenoviruses and retroviruses carrying the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV1-tk) gene; to compare the level of transgene expression induced by the 2 viral vectors; to evaluate the effects of viral transduction on cell phenotype, viability, proliferation rates, and differentiation capabilities; and to test the possibility of noninvasively imaging transduced MSCs using 9-(4-F-18-fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)guanine (F-18-FHBG) and small-animal PET after their transplantation into living rats. Methods: We infected rat bone marrow MSCs with adenoviruses carrying the HSV1 mutant tk (Ad-HSV1-sr39tk) PET reporter gene (PRG) or with a retroviral construct expressing the wild-type HSV1-tk PRG. The efficacy and intensity of HSV1-sr39tk and HSV1-tk gene expression were determined by a direct comparison of [8-H-3]-penciclovir ([8-H-3]-PCV) cell uptake in both infected MSC populations and noninfected control MSCs. Small-animal PET studies were performed on living rats after an intramuscular injection of infected MSCs. The MSCs either have been incubated in advance with F-18-FHBG or were administered after an intravenous injection of F-18-FHBG. Results: Both adenoviral and retroviral vectors can be used to introduce the tk PRG in MSCs. Neither adenovirus nor retrovirus infections significantly modify MSC phenotype, viability, proliferation, and differentiation capabilities. No significant H-3-PCV uptake was observed in noninfected MSCs. By contrast, after both adenoviral and retroviral infections, the infected MSC populations exhibited a similar, significantly higher, H-3-PCV accumulation. Small-animal PET images showed intense activity within the transplanted regions irrespective of the infected MSC population used. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the feasibility of infecting MSCs with adenoviruses and retroviruses expressing the HSV1-tk PRG and suggest that infected MSCs can be noninvasively imaged with F-18-FHBG and small-animal PET after their transplantation into living animals.

Studies on the transmission of Kyasanur Forest Disease virus by Haemophysalis spinigera Newman								TRANS ROY SOC TROP MED AND HYG				54	(6)			509	515		10.1016/0035-9203(60)90024-9				1960	1960	Laboratory tests have indicated that the larvae of the tick Haemophysalis spinigera could readily be infected by the virus of Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) that was being maintained in chicks. Such ticks were still infective when they became adults, and the cycle of "chick-tick-chick" can be maintained. In every case the virus isolated after each passage was the "KFD" type. The virus was transmitted by tick bite to a young buffalo calf, and was recovered along with neutralizing and low HI antibodies from the calf's blood. No CF antibodies have been recovered following such transfer. No naturally infected ticks have as yet been found, but epidemiological as well as the experimental evidence points to ticks as the natural vector of the disease. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A. C.

In mouse models these transcriptional repressors can trigger transformation, acting as bona fide oncogenes. Whether class IIa HDACs also exhibit transforming activities in human cells is currently unknown. We infected primary human fibroblasts with retroviruses to investigate the transforming activity of HDAC4 in cooperation with well-known oncogenes. We have discovered that HDAC4 triple mutant (S246A, S467A, S632A) (HDAC4-TM), a nuclear resident version of the deacetylase, triggers TP53 stabilization and OIS (oncogene-induced senescence). Unlike RAS, HDAC4-induced OIS was TP53-dependent and characterized by rapid cell cycle arrest and accumulation of an unusual pattern of gamma H2AX-positive foci. The inactivation of both TP53 and of the retinoblastoma (pRb) tumor suppressors, as induced by the viral oncogenes large and small T of SV40, triggers anchorage-independent growth in RAS, HDAC4-TM and, to a lesser extent, in HDAC4-wild type (WT)-expressing cells. Our results suggest an oncogenic function of class IIa HDACs in human cells, and justify further efforts to discover and evaluate isoform-specific inhibitors of these epigenetic regulators from a therapeutic perspective.

Role of Verrallina funerea (Diptera: Culicidae) in transmission of Barmah Forest virus and Ross River virus in coastal areas of eastern Australia.

Aspects of the vector competence of this species for Barmah Forest virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, BFV) and Ross River virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus, RRV), two medically important arboviruses in Australia, were investigated. Laboratory-reared Ve. funerea were moderately susceptible to experimental infection with BFV (median cell culture infectious dose of 103.6 per mosquito) and were capable of transmission to suckling mice (52% after a 9-12-d extrinsic incubation period). Maximum salivary gland infections for BFV (65%) and RRV (50%) were observed 8 and 10 d postinfection, respectively. To examine any regional differences in vector competence, field populations (separated by up to 200 km) of Ve. funerea and Aedes vigilax (Skuse) from southeastern Queensland and northern New South Wales were fed BFV and RRV, and subsequent infection rates were compared. For both viruses, no statistically significant variations in body, disseminated, or salivary gland infection rates were found in either Ve. funerea or Ae. vigilax. The results from this study indicate that Ve. funerea may have an important role as an amplification vector during outbreaks of both viruses and that local government authorities should rapidly treat brackish water habitats to control this species during periods of increased disease activity.

Bol.					16			39 pp.	39 pp.						1934	1934	II. This is a summary of the authors' experiments and observations since December, 1931.Field observations yield convincing evidence that under natural conditions the disease is confined to bovines. Attempts to set up the disease in nine horses by subdural, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intradermal inoculation of virus were unsuccessful. Eight out of ten inoculated bovines developed typical symptoms, but only one of these became infected after one inoculation; some of the others withstood the inoculation as many as four times and eventually succumbed. Fatal results occurred within 86 hours of the appearance of symptoms in bovines, dogs, rabbits, guineapigs and mice. In swine the symptoms continued for a week and 80 per cant. of the inoculated animals recovered. It was not possible to infect birds or reptiles. Rabbits and guineapigs are suitable experimental animals, but artificial infection is not invariably successful in them. This does not appear to be due to any natural immunity as the same animals may subsequently be found to be susceptible. The incubation period after artificial infection varies from two days in guineapigs to eight days in bovines.The outstanding symptoms are nervous trembling leading to paralysis and an intense pruritus (at the seat of inoculation in experimentally infected animals) which causes the animal to bite or, in the case of cattle, even to horn the lesion. The virus was easily demonstrated in the tissues of the fetus in utero in an affected animal. The ease with which the virus can be found in the blood stream is a major point of differentiation from rabies.The virus did not survive for more than 92 days in 50 per cant. glycerine at temperatures of 5° to 8°C. It was not inactivated by 0.3 per cant. of phenol in 40 days and it withstood desiccation for 65 days.The authors have failed to transmit the disease in dogs and mice by cohabitation. In the case of mice the affected animals were frequently observed to bite the healthy ones. No virus could be demonstrated in urine or saliva from affected animals. Artificial infection could be set up with filtrates through Berkefeld filters 11, 12, 14 and 15, but not with those through Chamberland B or F.Attempts to produce active immunity in dogs, rabbits, guineapigs and swine with phenolized and desiccated virus, with ascending doses of untreated virus and by intradermal inoculation of virus were unsuccessful. Sera from horses which had been inoculated with large quantities of virus over a long period did not afford any passive immunity, but some encouragement was obtained from the use of sera from recovered pigs which had received further large inoculations of virus. Methylacridine, trypaflavine and urotropine had no effect upon the course of the disease. No cross-immunity between true rabies and Aujeszky's disease could be demonstrated. Eight dogs immunized against rabies were successfully infected with Aujeszky's disease and five equines which had received large quantities of Aujeszky's disease virus were successfully infected with rabies. From these results and from somewhat indefinite observations on the epizootiology of Aujeszky's disease the authors conclude that there is no cross-immunity. [The authors' results do not justify this conclusion. They have shown that animals immune to rabies are still susceptible to Aujeszky's disease, but the animals which were inoculated with Aujeszky's disease virus and were subsequently found to be susceptible to rabies had not been shown to be immune to Aujeszky's disease, as in another part of this work they failed to demonstrate any active immunity to that disease. They further state that an animal may succumb to Aujeszky's disease at the fourth or fifth inoculation of virus. There is a complete absence of proof that the inoculation of equines with Aujeszky's disease virus leads to any immuno-logical reaction].The pathology of the disease resolves itself into a description of secondary traumatic changes at the seat of inoculation, which extend with the pruritus along the courses of nerves and lymphatics. Changes of an inflammatory nature in the central nervous system are described.-R. S. ROBERTS.																					CABI:19342202354

To investigate its role in T cell immunity we infected wild type and LFG knockout bone marrow chimaeras mice with LCMV. We observed a decreased number of LFG KO activated CD8 and CD4 T cells throughout the infection and a marked decrease in LFG KO LCMV specific memory T cells. WT and KO T cells proliferated at the same rate, however, LFG KO CD44(hi) T cells showed increased cell death during the initial phase of the immune response. LFG KO and WT T cells were equally sensitive to the FAS antibody Jo-2 in ex vivo cultures, and blocking extrinsic pathways of cell death in vivo with Fas L or caspase 8 inhibitors did not rescue the increased apoptosis in LFG KO T cells. Our data suggest that LFG plays a role in T cell survival during the initial phase of anti-viral immune response by protecting preexisting memory T cells and possibly newly activated T cells resulting in a diminished immune response and a decreased number of LCMV specific memory T cells.

CCL7 Is a Negative Regulator of Cutaneous Inflammation Following Leishmania major Infection								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				9						3063	10.3389/fimmu.2018.03063				JAN 8 2019	2019	The chemokine CCL7 (MCP3) is known to promote the recruitment of many innate immune cell types including monocytes and neutrophils to sites of bacterial and viral infection and eosinophils and basophils to sites of allergic inflammation. CCL7 upregulation has been associated with many inflammatory settings including infection, cardiovascular disease, and the tumor microenvironment. CCL7's pleotropic effects are due in part to its ability to bind numerous chemokine receptors, namely CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CCR10. CCL7-blockade or CCL7-deficiency is often marked by decreased inflammation and poor pathogen control. In the context of Leishmania major infection, CCL7 is specifically upregulated in the skin one-2 weeks after infection but its role in L. major control is unclear. To determine CCL7's impact on the response to L. major we infected WT and CCL7(-/-) C57BL/6 mice. L. major infection of CCL7-deficient mice led to an unexpected increase in inflammation in the infected skin 2 weeks post-infection. A broad increase in immune cell subsets was observed but was dominated by enhanced neutrophilic infiltration. Increased neutrophil recruitment was associated with an enhanced IL-17 gene profile in the infected skin. CCL7 was shown to directly antagonize neutrophil migration in vitro and CCL7 add-back in vivo specifically reduced neutrophil influx into the infected skin revealing an unexpected role for CCL7 in limiting neutrophil recruitment during L. major infection. Enhanced neutrophilic infiltration in CCL7-deficient mice changed the balance of L. major infected host cells with an increase in the ratio of infected neutrophils over monocytes/macrophages. To determine the consequence of CCL7 deficiency on L. major control we analyzed parasite load cutaneously at the site of infection and viscerally in the draining LN and spleen. The CCL7(-/-) mice supported robust cutaneous parasite control similar to their WT C57BL/6 counterparts. In contrast, CCL7-deficiency led to greater parasite dissemination and poor parasite control in the spleen. Our studies reveal a novel role for CCL7 in negatively regulating cutaneous inflammation, specifically neutrophils, early during L. major infection. We propose that CCL7-mediated dampening of the early immune response in the skin may limit the ability of the parasite to disseminate without compromising cutaneous control.

In this study, we investigated the histopathological changes and the distribution of viral antigens in extraneural organs after pathogenic rabies virus infection in mouse and rat models. In histopathological examination, classical viral encephalitis and rabies-specific Negri body were observed in the brain. In addition to the central nervous system (CNS), inflammatory responses were found in other organs, such as the heart, kidney, liver, and lung. Similarly, immunohistochemical staining and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of rabies virus in the CNS and extraneural tissues. Moreover, macrophages, especially in the lung and heart, were involved in the infection. Transcriptional analyses of the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) demonstrated that rabies virus potentiated the gene expression of iNOS in the brain, lung, and heart. The immunoreactive iNOS-positive macrophages were detected adjacent to the infection. These results suggest that macrophages are involved in the extraneural infection and the expression of iNOS in macrophages contributes to the formation of tissue inflammation. Our study indicates the involvement of extraneural organs following rabies virus infection, which may aggravate the progression of this deadly disease.

During infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13, the CD4(+) T-cell responses are lost. In this study, we were interested in the nature of the CD4(+) T-cell responses following infection with LCMV clone 13. To pursue this question, we infected C57BL/6 mice with LCMV clone 13. We used a GP66-80 MHC Class II tetramer to determine whether the CD4(+) T cells were present following infection with LCMV clone 13. We determined that the cells were present and antigen specific, but not functional. We attributed their dysfunction to the presence of CD4(+) T-cell inhibitory ligands. We further stained for the presence of CD4(+) T-cell inhibitory ligands. We found that the during chronic infection the number of CD4(+) T cells expressing programmed death-1 and CD160 were greater over the time-course study than the other CD4(+) T-cell inhibitory ligands. These data show that using CD4(+) T-cell inhibitory ligands as a reagent for characterization can help in understanding the complex immune responses associated with persistent infections.

Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus Infection Yields Overlapping CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-Cell Responses								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				82	23			11734	11741		10.1128/JVI.00435-08				DEC 2008	2008	Activation of CD4(+) T cells helps establish and sustain other immune responses. We have previously shown that responses against a broad set of nine CD4(+) T-cell epitopes were present in the setting of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) Armstrong infection in the context of H-2(d). This is quite disparate to the H-2(b) setting, where only two epitopes have been identified. We were interested in determining whether a broad set of responses was unique to H-2(d) or whether additional CD4(+) T-cell epitopes could be identified in the setting of the H-2(b) background. To pursue this question, we infected C57BL/6 mice with LCMV Armstrong and determined the repertoire of CD4(+) T-cell responses using overlapping 15-mer peptides corresponding to the LCMV Armstrong sequence. We confirmed positive responses by intracellular cytokine staining and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide binding assays. A broad repertoire of responses was identified, consisting of six epitopes. These epitopes originate from the nucleoprotein (NP) and glycoprotein (GP). Out of the six newly identified CD4(+) epitopes, four of them also stimulate CD8(+) T cells in a statistically significant manner. Furthermore, we assessed these CD4(+) T-cell responses during the memory phase of LCMV Armstrong infection and after infection with a chronic strain of LCMV and determined that a subset of the responses could be detected under these different conditions. This is the first example of a broad repertoire of shared epitopes between CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the context of viral infection. These findings demonstrate that immunodominance is a complex phenomenon in the context of helper responses.																					WOS:000260789700024	18829752

GFP expression from AAV-DJ was about 1.5-fold superior to that observed with AAV-2 and lasted for at least 21 days as was evaluated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. AAV-DJ proves to be suitable for the infection of rat and human MSC with a similar efficiency. Infected MSC were still viable but showed a 25-30% growth-rate slowdown. Moreover, we found an increase of SERPINB2 mRNA expression in human MSC while expression of other oxidative stress markers and extracellular matrix proteins was not affected. These results suggest that there is a differential cellular response in MSC infected with AAV viral vectors, which should be taken into account as it can affect the expected outcome for the therapeutic application.

Strongyloides stercoralis represents the main species that infects human beings. Ivermectin is the current drug of choice; however, issues related with treatment failure in patients with diabetes or infected with T-lymphotropic virus-1 make the identification of new molecules for alternative treatment a priority. In the present study, the activity of sphingosine-related aminoalcohol and diamine were evaluated against Strongyloides venezuelensis third-stage larva (L3) cultures and experimental infections in mice.Methods: The efficacy of each compound against L3 was assessed using both XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay and microscopic observation with concentrations ranging from 1 to 350 mu M. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using J774.2 macrophage cell line and XTT assay. Lethal concentration 50 (LC50), selectivity index (SI) and structure-activity relationships were established. The activity compounds 4 (2-(ethylamino) hexadecan-1-ol), 6 (2-(butylamino) hexadecan-1-ol), 17 (tert-butyl N-(1-aminododecan-2-yl) carbamate) and 18 (tert-butyl-N-(1-aminohexadecan-2-yl) carbamate) were further assessed against experimental S. venezuelensis infections in CD1 mice measuring reductions in the numbers of parthenogenetic females and egg passed in faeces. Mice were infected with 3,000 L3 and treated with 20 mg/kg/day for five days.Results: In the screening study of 15 aminoalcohols [lauryl (n = 9); palmityl (n = 13); stearyl (n = 15) and alcohol derivatives], the presence of a palmitol chain was associated with the highest efficacy against L3 (LC50 31.9-39. 1 mu M). Alkylation of the 2-amino group with medium size fragments as ethyl or n-butyl showed the best larvicidal activity. The dialkylation did not improve efficacy. Aminoalcohols 4 and 6 showed the highest SI (1.5 and 1.6, respectively). With respect to diamine derivative compounds, a chain size of sixteen carbon atoms (palmitoyl chain, n = 13), and the alkylation of the 2-amino group with medium-sized fragments, were associated with the highest lethal activities. The presence of carbamoyl group in diamines 17 and 18 yielded high SI (1.7 and 1.4, respectively). Infected mice treated with aminoalcohol 6 showed reduction in parthenogenetic females (59 %) and eggs in faeces (51 %).Conclusions: These results support the potentiality of aminoalcohol and diamine sphingosine-related compounds as suitable prototypes for developing new promising drugs against strongyloidiasis.

Radioisotopes in the infection of experimental laboratory animals with virus MHV3, influenzal NWS and from Trypanosoma brucei				I Radioisotopi nella infezione sperimentale di animali da laboratorio con virus MHV3, influenzale NWS e da Try-panosoma Brucei				ARCH ITAL SCI MED TROP PARASSITOL				47	(7/8)			199	210						1966	1966	Observations and experiments were carried out on 54 male prepuberic rats by introducing living organisms containing radioactive substances which will lodge in certain organs. The radioisotopes aid in establishing the function and the disease of that organ. First, an experimental hepatic infection was observed due to the virus MHV 3, 2nd an experimental infection of the influenza virus NWS, and 3rd, an experimental infection due to Trypansoma brucei. The methods used and the liver and spleen are considered as related to the radioactive studies, and the results are evaluated by statistical calculations. Radioisotopes can be utilized within the pathological field as it is associated with parasitic and infectious diseases. The simplicity of this method reveals many alternations and infections within the experimental animal. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth																					BCI:BCI19684900063295	4295330

J	Dea, S; Wilson, L; Therrien, D; Cornaglia, E								Competitive ELISA for detection of antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus using recombinant E-coli-expressed nucleocapsid protein as antigen								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS				87	1-2			109	122		10.1016/S0166-0934(00)00158-0				JUN 2000	2000	The 15 kDa nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most abundant protein of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and is highly antigenic, which therefore makes it a suitable candidate for the detection of virus-specific antibodies and diagnosis of the disease. In this study, complementary DNA corresponding to the entire N gene of the IAF-Klop strain of PRRSV was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector, and the N protein was expressed in Escherichia coli fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein. The resulting GST-N recombinant fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography and used as antigen for serological testing by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Two anti-N specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (IAF-K8 and IAF-2B4), obtained following fusion experiments with spleen cells of BAlb/c mice that were immunized with the purified virus, were used in a competitive assay to increase the specificity of the ELISA. Both MAbs were found to be directed against highly conserved conformational epitopes of North American isolates of PRRSV. Optimal concentration of GST-N protein was determined by checkerboard titration, using hyperimmune pig antiserum to the homologous PRRSV strain, and corresponded to a range of 0.1-0.5 mu g protein per well. When tested on 95 sera from pigs that were experimentally infected with the IAF-Klop strain, the competitive ELISA (K8-ELISA) was capable of detecting anti-PRRSV antibodies in 86.7% (65/75) and 92.6% (63/68) of pig sera known to be seropositive by indirect immunofluorescence (antibody titers > 16) and a currently used commercial ELISA (HerdCheck((R)); Idexx), with specificity Values of 100 and 96.2%, respectively. When tested on clinical samples (542 sera) from 28 positive and 28 negative pig herds, the K8-ELISA performed in a similar way to HerdCheck((R)) and immunofluorescence (IF) tests as shown by kappa values of 0.762 and 0.803. The sensitivity and specificity of K8-ELISA were 100% on a herd basis, whereas sensitivity values of 80 and 82% with a specificity of 98.7% were determined on an individual basis in comparison with HerdCheck((R)) and IF tests.

However, the reason for these differences remains unknown. In order to understand why SA14-14-2 is superior to SA14-9-7 and SA14-5-3, we employed a reverse genetics method to identify the key mutations in the virus genome that determine the immunogenicity of live attenuated Japanese encephalitis viruses. We first sequenced the full genomic sequences of SA14-9-7 and SA14-5-3 and found mutations that changed four amino-acid base pairs when compared to the envelope gene of SA14-14-2. We mutated the genome of SA14-14-2 to generate these mutations both singly (E-177, E-264, E-279 and E-315) and in combination (E-177/264, E-279/315 and E-177/264/279/315) and tested these mutants along with parental strains SA14-14-2, SA14-9-7 and SA14-5-3 for their immunogenicity in vivo. When mice were immunized with SA14-9-7 and SA14-5-3, lower levels of neutralizing antibodies were generated compared with the immune response to SA14-14-2. Furthermore, SA14-5-3 was more immunogenic than SA14-9-7, which replicated the results previously seen in humans. Point mutations E-177, E-264, E-279 and E-315 diminished the immunogenicity of SA14-14-2 with E-264 and E-315, contributing the most to this phenotype. The mutant rJEV (E-177/E-264/E-279/E-315) containing all four point mutations exhibited the lowest immunogenicity with a seroconversion rate of 0 at an inoculation dose of 10(3) PFU (plaque-forming unit). We have identified the key amino acids in the envelope protein that account for the superior immunogenicity of SA14-14-2.																					WOS:000454603800030	29263913

Bulletin de la Societe de Pathologie Exotique				10	5			377	378						1917, May 9th	1917	Canine toxoplasmosis is recorded from Tunis for the first time, the conditions of infection being very obscure. Two dogs, B and C, were inoculated with the product of crushing ticks in the nymphal stage procured from a dog, A, suffering from experimental kala-azar (canine virus). The animal, B, became ill within a month, exhibiting double conjunctivitis and opacity of both corneas, but the post-mortem examination revealed no parasites either of leishmaniasis or of toxoplasmosis. The animal, C, died shortly afterwards, without any illness, the autopsy revealing the presence of toxoplasma in the organs. The destruction and examination of the dog, A, revealed many leishmania but no toxoplasma. Three hypotheses are possible: The dog, C, may have been naturally infected with toxoplasmosis before the inoculation. The inoculation from the dog, A, may have caused the infection, although neither of the inoculated animals showed toxoplasma at the autopsy. Toxoplasmosis may have been transmitted to the dog, C, by larvae from the gundi [Ctenodactylus gundi], some of which were kept in the same building, these animals becoming naturally infected with toxoplasmosis during the autumn and winter, during which time the inoculations were carried out.A similar case was observed at Frankfort-On-Main, the subject being a dog inoculated with the organs of a dog infected with canine leishmaniasis, which had been sent from the Pasteur Institute at. Tunis, and which had lived in the same conditions as the dog referred to above.																					CABI:19171000266

Rift valley fever virus lacking the NSs and NSm genes is highly attenuated, confers protective immunity from virulent virus challenge, and allows for differential identification of infected and vaccinated animals								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				82	6			2681	2691		10.1128/JVI.02501-07				MAR 2008	2008	Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus is a mosquito-borne human and veterinary pathogen associated with large outbreaks of severe disease throughout Africa and more recently the Arabian peninsula. Infection of livestock can result in sweeping "abortion storms" and high mortality among young animals. Human infection results in self-limiting febrile disease that in similar to 1 to 2% of patients progresses to more serious complications including hepatitis, encephalitis, and retinitis or a hemorrhagic syndrome with high fatality. The virus S segment-encoded NSs and the M segment-encoded NSm proteins are important virulence factors. The development of safe, effective vaccines and tools to screen and evaluate antiviral compounds is critical for future control strategies. Here, we report the successful reverse genetics generation of multiple recombinant enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged RVF viruses containing either the full-length, complete virus genome or precise deletions of the NSs gene alone or the NSs/NSm genes in combination, thus creating attenuating deletions on multiple virus genome segments. These viruses were highly attenuated, with no detectable viremia or clinical illness observed with high challenge dosages (1.0 X 10(4) PFU) in the rat lethal disease model. A single-dose immunization regimen induced robust anti-RVF virus immunoglobulin G antibodies (titer, similar to 1:6,400) by day 26 postvaccination. All vaccinated animals that were subsequently challenged with a high dose of virulent RVF virus survived infection and could be serologically differentiated from naive, experimentally infected animals by the lack of NSs antibodies. These rationally designed marker RVF vaccine viruses will be useful tools for in vitro screening of therapeutic compounds and will provide a basis for further development of RVF virus marker vaccines for use in endemic regions or following the natural or intentional introduction of the virus into previously unaffected areas.

Report of the 4th Plenary Session of the Veterinary Section of the Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, 1935.								108 pp.	108 pp.						1939	1939	This is a series of papers presented by members of research institutes and of scientific expeditions to the above meeting held in November 1935 on equine encephalomyelitis which during the years 1932-35 had shown a considerable increase in incidence in Russia.Papers PresentedEQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AND ITS CONTROL. [MAKAROV, P. M.]-M. reviewed many aspects of E.E. in Russia in considerable detail. The disease has been known in Russian literature since 1795. During 1900-1912, 3, 636 cases, including 2, 007 fatal cases, were reported in 29 government districts. In recent years the disease has tended to spread from the south to the south-east and north. Outbreaks occur periodically, usually increasing in intensity during the first 2-3 years and then subsiding. In the areas affected the incidence is higher among newly introduced horses. There appears to be a definite seasonal incidence between May and September with the highest mortality during September. Seven varieties of virus strains were obtained from 80 brains. The isolation and the purification of the virus is beset with many difficulties, auto-sterilization being one. The virus is easily killed by heat and chemicals, but survives temperatures of -180°C. It can be transmitted to, and passaged in, horses, cats, dogs, pigs, sheep, mice, rats, g. pigs, and rabbits. Fowls and pigeons are refractory. The mode of natural infection is unknown, but the disease is possibly transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Acidophile inclusior bodies have been observed in ganglion cells of that central nervous system in naturally as well as in artificially infected animals. M. was unable to confirm that claims of VYSHELESSKII V. B. 6. 228. who isolatec virus from the saliva and urine of experimentall infected cats this is probably because V. was working in error with a rabies virus (see HOWITT-V. B. 12 84)-Ed. He also found that the saliva of an affecte horse did not contain virus. Clinical symptoms ar not constant; nervous symptoms predominate. Previous to nervous manifestations, the animals show signs of fatigue, sweating, and drowsiness. The temperature may be normal or subnormal, and it may rise during the initial stages. The disease may run a mild, clinically unrecognizable form. It is supposed that many horses in affected areas acquire some degree of immunity. Diagnosis can be made by combined epizoological, pathological, and clinical findings. Haematological examinations, including blood bilirubin estimations, have some diagnostic significance, but are not of primary value for diagnosis. Early symptomatic treatment and nursing can greatly reduce losses. Bismuth and mercuric preparations in mass experiments proved to be ineffective. Specific serum treatment is of value in early cases. Active immunization with vaccines has been effective against experimental infections, but was less effective under field conditions. Measures of control and indications for research work were suggested.BIOLOGY OF THE VIRUS [MUTOVIN, V. L]-The virus passes through Chamberland L2 and L3, Berkefeld N and V, and Seitz-H filters. After filtration it cannot be passaged much further, it is less virulent, and the incubation period is lengthened to 10-30 days instead of four. The changes produced in the central nervous system are less pronounced and inclusion bodies are scarce when such modified virus is used to set up infection. Sunlight and methylene blue acting separately do not destroy the virus, while together they can inactivate it within 5-10 min. Using this property, M. prepared " photovaccines ", the protective value of which was shown to be very high in experimental animals.BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN THE SERUM OF AFFECTED HORSES AND CERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF THE VIRUS. [SHMANENKOV, N. A.]-S. dealt with changes in viscosity, refraction, surface tension, pH and alkalinity of serum. Using Sigmondi's method, the size of the virus was found to be 80-120 m. The virus is easily adsorbed by aluminium hydroxide and other adsorbante.INFLUENCE OF EXPERIMENTAL E.E. ON THE NITROGEN AND MINERAL METABOLISM OF RABBITS. [SHOKHOR, N. I.]-The N metabolism and the P values are not affected. Ca values increase at the beginning and fall as the infection progresses, while the reverse is true of Mg values. Adult dogs could be artificially infected by subarachnoidal and intra-ocular injection only after the virus had been passaged through puppies.PATHOGENESIS OF EPIZOOTIC E.E. [SMETKIN, M. F.]-S. discussed disturbances of the reticvdo-endothelial system, which are manifested by stimulation in the initial stages and by blockade towards the end of the infection, and pointed out changes in composition and morphology of the blood, such as an increase in pH, lowering of alkalinity, and hyperglycaemia and glyco-suria at the beginning and hypoglycaemia towards the end of the infection, and increase of lactic acid, eosino-philes, basophiles, and regenerative forms of blood cells. These changes were also observed during the latent and initial stages of the disease. The latent form is important and, according to S., not by any means rare; ten out of 65 horses examined were found to have a latent infection. It appears that during this stage the virus circulates in the blood. Using blood from a horse with z latent infection, S. succeeded, by intradermal inoculation, in infecting rabbits whose blood-brain barrier had been made permeable, whereas the inoculation of normal rabbits by various methods, using brain emulsion of the same horse, failed. S. indicates the importance of secondary factors in predisposing to infection. Pigeons, which under normal conditions are not susceptible to E.E. virus, could be infected after being fed a deficient ration. Vaccination experiments were conducted using so-called " realisats-lysats " prepared from the brain and r.e.s.CHANGES IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM IN E.E. [LEBEDEV, N. A.]-The changes in the c.n.s. during natural E.E. infection are unlike those caused by other neurotropic viruses. The c.n.s. as well as the liver and spleen show at the same time signs of two different processes; one which is chronic and affects mainly the mesenchyme is of the nature of a chronic endotheliosis, and the other, of more acute character, affects the parenchymatous tissues. In L.'s opinion, the chronic changes in the r.e.s. show that early circulation of the virus takes place long before nervous symptoms are clinically apparent; only after the resistance of the r.e.s. is lowered does the virus gain access to the parenchyma.NERVOUS SYNDROME IN ACUTE DIFFUSE E.E. [RUSETSKII, I. I.]-R. made a detailed neurological examination of naturally infected horses and described his methods and observations; these are of interest not only in E.E., but also when applied to neurological examinations of horses in general. He described & sclerometer for the examination of muscular tone. During the course of this disease many nervous symptoms can be observed; some of these, such as dullness and stupor are due to general intoxication and others clearly indicate the seats of pathological lesions in different parts of the c.n.s. R. defines this disease as " encephalomyelitis disseminata infectiosa acuta equorum ". Various symptoms of incoordination, motor irritation, deranged consciousness, and deranged senses have been described. According to R., it is misleading and incorrect to speak of excitative and dumb forms of E.E. Besides the usual form of the disease, a malignant, peracute and a benign, abortive form have been met with. Recovered animals may show asymmetry in muscular tonus and change of general behaviour and character.PATHOGENESIS AND IMMUNITY IN E.E. [PoNO-MAREV, A. V.]-In experimental animals the virus shows neurotropic properties. Artificial infection of rabbits can be set up by intracerebral, intraneural, or subarachnoidal inoculation; intramuscular and intracorneal inoculations only occasionally infect, while intravenous and intraperitoneal inoculations produce infection only in rabbits with a permeable blood-brain barrier. A great deal of work has been done on the role of the blood-brain barrier. It has been found that in experimentally infected horses, but not in healthy animals, bacterio-phage (used as test object) injected intravenously soon appears in the c.s.f. P. concludes that E.E. virus disturbs the impermeability of the blood-brain barrier so that there is penetration into the brain tissues. The preparation of hyperimmune serum is described. Detailed experiments on passive and active immunization under laboratory and field conditions were conducted, but the results were not always satisfactory. Experiments on local immunization of the c.n.s. have also been conducted and highly viricidal bodies have been observed in the c.s.f.Discussion of PapersSINEV recommended the examination of the c.s.f. for diagnostic purposes and the intracisternal introduction of serum as a therapeutic measure.MUROMTSEV indicated the possibility of immunization with killed antigens.LEONOV referred to formol and pigeon vaccines said to have been used in America and described favourable results which he had obtained using lysates of reticulo-endothelial tissues prepared by TUSHNOV'S method. He described results obtained by the Kazan Research Institute during an expedition in the Tartar Republic and dealt with conditions favouring the spread of infection. It has been observed that the incidence and mortality rate are higher among horses which have overcome an attack of piroplasmosis in the previous spring.SMOTRIKOV reported favourable results in Siberia using hyperimmune serum for prophylaxis and treatment, eight out of nine horses recovering.GAMALEYA urged the necessity for further study of the epizoology of the disease, especially with regard to the vector.VYSHELESSKII summarized the results of using hyperimmune serum (20 recoveries out of 30), and convalescent serum (16 recoveries out of 19). Formol vaccines proved to be effective prophylactics in 700 horses in different districts. More than one inoculation is advisable. In V.'s opinion, cats and mice are more suitable as experimental animals than rabbits; dogs are refractory. V. referred to his previous reports [V. B. 6. 228.] on the isolation of E.E. virus from saliva, urine, and the intestinal mucosa of cats. [See note in abst. of paper by MAKAROV, above].SKRYABIN urged the importance of study of vectors and clinical treatment, and stated that control must be tackled from the entomological aspect. The necessity is indicated of founding a special arachno-entornological department as a part of the Federal Institute of Experimental Veterinary Medicine and of founding an All-Union Institute for clinical veterinary science.SHCHEPALOV indicated that virus in experimental E.E. travels along the nerves. Lesions in the ganglion nodosum of the vagus nerve differ according to whether inoculation is by the subcutaneous or intracerebral route.CHERNYAK stated that there is not sufficient reason to regard E.E. virus as neurotropic. The degenerative and proliferative changes observed in 25 affected brains which he examined are not more characteristic than encephalitis lesions produced by many viruses, e.g. that of swine fever. Clinical E.E. can be experimentally produced only by intracerebral inoculation and not by the intramuscular or subcutaneous routes. For pathological-anatomical diagnosis the lesions in the liver are more important than those of the brain.VERTINSKII referred to controversies in the literature which are due to overlooking the fact that passage causes changes in the properties of the virus.KOKURICHEV investigated early changes in the adventitious and endothelial tissue and in nerve ganglia. By intracerebral, intraneural, and intravenous inoculation of mice, lesions in the c.n.s. can be observed, but not after subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or nasal instillation. E.E. produced artificially is unlike the natural infection.PAVLOV referred to the increase of myelocytes in the blood and stated that nervousness in horses was one of the earliest symptoms of infection.KOLYAKOV reported two single cases of artificial transmission of E.E. in horses by intra-ocular and intranasal inoculation with scarification of the mucous membrane. In his opinion the use of severe quarantine restrictions as part of the measures for the control of the disease would not produce results that would compensate for the inconvenience due to interference in the economic life of the areas affected. In 20 P.M. examinations, most changes were found in the livers and brains.TSUVERKALOV CRITICZED THE PAPER BY SHAMANENKOV.IVANOV confirmed the observations made by VYSHELESSKII that rabbits of the Alma-Ata district (Turkmenia) are very resistant to E.E. infection. When transported to Siberia, however, the Alma-Ata rabbits could be easily infected.SMIRNOV referred to some controversies in the papers and to specimens shown at the meeting.Resolution passed by the SessionThe resolution is divided into four parts. The first part contains a review of achievements based mainly, but not exclusively, on the matter in the above papers.The second part contains recommendations for field work including measures of veterinary control such as the quarantining of affected farms, use of serum and vaccines, symptomatic treatment, and a ban on the use, for the treatment of affected horses, of convalescent serum from horses that might be infected with equine infectious anaemia.In the third part suggestions are made to veterinary research institutes for investigational work, such as studies on the virus, its concentration, purification, and cultivation, and the extension of experimental work on pathogenesis, therapy, prophylaxis, etc.The fourth section of the resolution deals with the organization of research work. It is recommended that all the research work on E.E. be centralized in two institutes (the All-Union Institute for Experimental Veterinary Science in Moscow and the Kazan Research Institute) and that the aspects of the disease to be dealt with at each institute be outlined. Recommendations are made for further meetings and conferences to deal with the problem in detail.-A. MOLDAWSKY.																					CABI:19432200837		
J	Deinhardt, F; Wolfe, L; Falk, L; Johnson, T; Johnson, D; Massey, R								Immunological control of virus-induced tumors in primates.								Bibliotheca haematologica					40			639	48						1975	1975	Cells infected by oncogenic viruses may transform, may develop a latent carrier state, or may be destroyed but understanding of the control of the results of infection is incomplete. Even if cells transform, ultimate development of a tumor may be immunologically controlled. For example, cells of some marmoset species transform after infection with RNA tumor viruses, and animals react to the transformed cells with cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Both virus specific and cross-reacting cell membrane antigens have been demonstrated. Immune deficiency accelerates tumor growth or causes recurrence of a regressing tumor. In contrast certain simian herpesvirus (Herpesvirus saimiri, HVS and Herpesvirus ateles, HVA), which cause no or minor disease in their natural hosts, induce lymphomas or lymphoblastic leukemias in other primate species. The immune response of the natural host species to HVS is greater than that of animals developing malignancies after experimental infection. HVS and HVA share many properties with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) of man, including antigens appearing early and late during infection and their related antibody responses but no evidence exists that they induce malignancies in their natural hosts. However, if induction is as infrequent as that with EBV and Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), we have not observed sufficient numbers of squirrel or spider monkeys to have seen a BL-like tumor. Interference with the immune systems of animals carrying HVS or HVA may induce tumor development, and clarify our understanding of the relationships between EBV and BL.

Th1-mediated responses favor the co-expression of T-box transcription factor 21 (T-bet) in Foxp3(+) Tregs, enabling the efficient Treg control of Th1 responses in infected tissues. So far, the exact accumulation kinetics of T cell subsets in the lungs and lung-draining lymph nodes (dLN) of IAV-infected mice is incompletely understood, and the epigenetic signature of Tregs accumulating in infected lungs has not been investigated. Here, we report that the total T cell and the two-step Treg accumulation in IAV-infected lungs is transient, whereas the change in the ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) T cells is more durable. Within lungs, the frequency of Tregs co-expressing T-bet is steadily, yet transiently, increasing with a peak at Day 7 post-infection. Interestingly, T-bet(+) Tregs accumulating in IAV-infected lungs displayed a strongly demethylated Tbx21 locus, similarly as in T-bet(+) conventional T cells, and a fully demethylated Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) within the Foxp3 locus. In summary, our data suggest that T-bet(+) but not T-bet(-) Tregs are epigenetically stabilized during IAV-induced infection in the lung.																					WOS:000676731100001	34299148

Ticks as possible carriers of spring encephalitis								MEDITSIN SKAIA PARAZITOLOGIIA I PARAZITARNYE BOLEZNI [MEDICAL PARA SITOLOGY AND PARASITIC DISEASES]				7	(3)			415	434						1938	1938	From general epidemiological considerations it is concluded that ticks are the most probable vectors of spring encephalitis of the U.S.S.R. A study of the distribution of different spp. of ixodid ticks in different types of habitat showed that Ixodes persulcatus is the predominating form in the wet forest regions in which cases of encephalitis occur, and Dermacentor silvarum and Haemaphysalis con-cinna are most abundant in regions free from encephalitis. In one expt., larvae of I. persulcatus were fed on mice injected 12 hrs. previous to the attachment of the larvae with encephalitis virus. The larvae engorged in 21/2-3 1/2 days and molted to nymphs 24-27 days later. When the nymphs were allowed to feed on healthy mice or were injected into them, no transmission of the virus occurred. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W. Trager																					BCI:BCI19401400002987

Electroporation Facilitates Introduction of Reporter Transgenes and Virions into Schistosome Eggs								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				4	2					e593	10.1371/journal.pntd.0000593				FEB 2010	2010	Background: The schistosome egg represents an attractive developmental stage at which to target transgenes because of the high ratio of germ to somatic cells, because the transgene might be propagated and amplified by infecting snails with the miracidia hatched from treated eggs, and because eggs can be readily obtained from experimentally infected rodents.Methods/Findings: We investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules including fluorescent (Cy3) short interference (si) RNA molecules, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. First, eggs were incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square wave electroporation. Cy3-signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Second, electroporation was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs. Luciferase activity was detected three hours later, whereas luciferase was not evident in eggs soaked in the mRNA. Third, schistosome eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Proviral transgenes were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs, indicating the presence of transgenes in larval schistosomes that had been either soaked or electroporated. However, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis determined that electroporation of virions resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in these schistosomes compared to soaking alone. In addition, relative qPCR indicated a copy number for the proviral luciferase transgene of,20 copies for 100 copies of a representative single copy endogenous gene (encoding cathepsin D).Conclusions: Square wave electroporation facilitates introduction of transgenes into the schistosome egg. Electroporation was more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped MLV than simply soaking the eggs in virions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.																					WOS:000275296200005	20126309

Passaging through 20 rabbits did not alter the virulence of the viras. 5% chlorinated lime and 20% slaked lime destroyed the virus instantly, and 0.6% NaOH solution after 30 sec. The virus was isolated from the central nervous system, spleen, lungs, and kidneys of naturally and experimentally infected animals. It was found in the urine of rabbits and grey rats only; it could not be detected in the urine of eight infected piglets examined. The virus was also isolated from aborted and mummified foetuses from a sow which did not show any clinical signs of the disease. A mild form of the diseasewas artificially produced in piglets by various routes of inoculation. Cats and dogs developed symptoms 3-6 days after subcutaneous inoculation and by feeding with infected meat. Rabbits showed itching for 6-8 hours at the seat of injection 3-4 days after inoculation. After intranasal application ihe itching occurred in the gluteal area, but in some cases it was absent. G. pigs showed symptoms after 3-4 days, but no itching was observed. White rats became infected only after intraocular inoculation; .symptoms were itching and paralysis of the extremities; grey rats were infected by the subcutaneous and intranasal routes and per os.A detailed discussion is given of the clinical Symptoms, P.M. findings, histological changes, and epizoology of the disease. In piglets the disease was characterized by nervous symptoms, but. in adult pigs it resembled influenza. The losses among piglets averages 40-50% and may reach 90-95%. Piglets of one month old were those most affected; hyperimmune serum proved to be effective for treatment of piglets.-A. MOLDAWSKY.																					CABI:19442201728

CCL7 upregulation has been associated with many inflammatory settings including infection, cardiovascular disease, and the tumor microenvironment. CCL7's pleotropic effects are due in part to its ability to bind numerous chemokine receptors, namely CCR1, CCR2, CCR3, CCR5, and CCR10. CCL7-blockade or CCL7-deficiency is often marked by decreased inflammation and poor pathogen control. In the context of Leishmania major infection, CCL7 is specifically upregulated in the skin one-2 weeks after infection but its role in L. major control is unclear. To determine CCL7's impact on the response to L. major we infected WT and CCL7/ C57BL/6 mice. L. major infection of CCL7-deficient mice led to an unexpected increase in inflammation in the infected skin 2 weeks post-infection. A broad increase in immune cell subsets was observed but was dominated by enhanced neutrophilic infiltration. Increased neutrophil recruitment was associated with an enhanced IL-17 gene profile in the infected skin. CCL7 was shown to directly antagonize neutrophil migration in vitro and CCL7 add-back in vivo specifically reduced neutrophil influx into the infected skin revealing an unexpected role for CCL7 in limiting neutrophil recruitment during L. major infection. Enhanced neutrophilic infiltration in CCL7-deficient mice changed the balance of L. major infected host cells with an increase in the ratio of infected neutrophils over monocytes/macrophages. To determine the consequence of CCL7 deficiency on L. major control we analyzed parasite load cutaneously at the site of infection and viscerally in the draining LN and spleen. The CCL7/ mice supported robust cutaneous parasite control similar to their WT C57BL/6 counterparts. In contrast, CCL7-deficiency led to greater parasite dissemination and poor parasite control in the spleen. Our studies reveal a novel role for CCL7 in negatively regulating cutaneous inflammation, specifically neutrophils, early during L. major infection. We propose that CCL7-mediated dampening of the early immune response in the skin may limit the ability of the parasite to disseminate without compromising cutaneous control.

The assays are based upon the availability of polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) from mouse ascitic fluids prepared against the New Jersey (NJ) and the Indiana (IN) VSV serotypes. The assays were performed by the immobilization of VSV-NJ and VSV-IN antigens on a solid phase (microtiter plate). Appropriately diluted test serum mixed with an equal volume of serotype-specific PAb was allowed to incubate in the presence of the relevant VSV antigen and finally with an enzyme-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin. In the absence of anti-VSV antibodies in the test serum, the VSV antigen sites are reactive with the relevant PAb (NJ or IN) as indicated by color development after enzyme degradation of substrate. If the test serum contains the homologous VSV-NJ or VSV-IN antibodies, they compete with the relevant PAb for immobilized antigen sites and quantitatively block and inhibit the PAb reaction and subsequent color development. The performance of C-ELISAs in detecting anti-VSV antibodies in serum samples from four calves, two horses, four sheep, and seven pigs experimentally infected with VSV-NJ and VSV-IN was evaluated. The sensitivity and specificity of the C-ELISAs were compared with those of the standard microtiter serum neutralization (MTSN) tests. Homologous antibodies were demonstrable by C-ELISAs as early as 5 days postinfection (DPI) in one horse and one sheep infected with VSV-IN serotype. Seroconversion was demonstrable by C-ELISAs and MTSN tests in all animals by 9 DPI except in one sheep that received VSV-NJ and one horse inoculated with VSV-IN serotype which, on the basis of the MTSN test results, did not seroconvert until 14 and 11 DPI, respectively. The dynamics of homologous antibody response in all animals as revealed by the corresponding type-specific C-ELISAs paralleled the results of the MTSN tests. The type-specific antibodies to VSV serotypes increased exponentially during the first 2 to 4 weeks postinfection and remained relatively stable for about 6 months in some animals. The results suggest that the C-ELISAs offer many advantages over the MTSN tests and have potential applications as rapid and inexpensive tests in serodiagnosis of VSV infections in animals.

J	Curca, D.								CONTRIBUTION OF PROFESSOR ALEXANDRU CIUCA (1880-1972) IN THE DIAGNOSIS AND ERADICATION OF ANIMAL DISEASES								REVISTA ROMANA DE MEDICINA VETERINARA				28	3			49	60						2018	2018	Alexandru Ciuca studied between 1896 and 1901 at the School of Veterinary Medicine in Bucharest, where he stood out, before delivering his inaugural graduation thesis entitled "Trial serotherapy of the glanders". His scientific training was completed in France, from 1910 to 1914, while working under the direction of Pasteur disciples such as: Weinberg, Brumpt, Raillet. At the Pasteur Institute in Paris he worked with Roux and Mesnil. In Germany he worked in Berlin in 1914, under the personal supervision of Ostertag and Neuman from University of Bonn. He then worked in England between 1927 and 1928, in the field of FMD, at the Lister Institute in London UK, which included original research, which later became classic.The young Alexandru Ciuca had the subtle inspiration to be the first in the world to use the reaction of the complement fixation method (CFT - complement fixation test) for the purpose of differentiation in terms of these antigenic types of viruses and Sera collected from different groups of guinea pigs inoculated through experimental infection or repeated vaccination with the three antigenic types of known viruses. In 1928, Al. Ciuca succeeded to make the typization of foot and mouth disease virus by the reaction of complement fixation (Bordet and Gengou), data published in "The Journal of Hygiene", p. 325-338, in London, 08 March, 1929. He thus contributed to the identification of the foot and mouth disease virus serotype as well as to the development of corresponding measures for foot and mouth disease prophylaxis.In the report entitled "Development of veterinary science during the last 100 years and men that illustrated the progress in this field" (Le developpement de la Science Veterinaire au cours des dernieres cent annees, XVII Congres mondial veterinaire, Hannover, aout, 1963), Professor Alexandru Ciuca was included in the Group of 30 prestigious names (R. Vuillaume). After recalling that "In Romania, Alexandru Ciuca gave us a method of treatment in dourine, which effectively resulted in the elimination of this disease in the whole of Europe" the report shows that Professor Ciuca published in Bull. of Int. Epiz. No. 7, pp. 168-193, in 1933, a scientific paper entitled "The dourine", in which he presented the symptoms of the disease and the methods of reducing the incidence of dourine in horses in Romania through appropriate treatments with subtoxic doses of neosalvarsam, results cited and commented in the Treaty of infectious diseases of Rersa Manninger and Janos Mocsy, 1959.

In vitro and in vivo evaluation of 2-aminoalkanol and 1,2-alkanediamine derivatives against Strongyloides venezuelensis.								Parasites and Vectors				9	364			(28 June 2016)	(28 June 2016)						2016	2016	Background: Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic disease widely present in tropical and subtropical areas. Strongyloides stercoralis represents the main species that infects human beings. Ivermectin is the current drug of choice; however, issues related with treatment failure in patients with diabetes or infected with T-lymphotropic virus-1 make the identification of new molecules for alternative treatment a priority. In the present study, the activity of sphingosine-related aminoalcohol and diamine were evaluated against Strongyloides venezuelensis third-stage larva (L3) cultures and experimental infections in mice. Methods: The efficacy of each compound against L3 was assessed using both XTT (2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide) assay and microscopic observation with concentrations ranging from 1 to 350 M. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using J774.2 macrophage cell line and XTT assay. Lethal concentration 50 (LC50), selectivity index (SI) and structure-activity relationships were established. The activity compounds 4 (2-(ethylamino) hexadecan-1-ol), 6 (2-(butylamino) hexadecan-1-ol), 17 (tert-butyl N-(1-aminododecan-2-yl) carbamate) and 18 (tert-butyl N-(1-aminohexadecan-2-yl) carbamate) were further assessed against experimental S. venezuelensis infections in CD1 mice measuring reductions in the numbers of parthenogenetic females and egg passed in faeces. Mice were infected with 3,000 L3 and treated with 20 mg/kg/day for five days. Results: In the screening study of 15 aminoalcohols [lauryl (n=9); palmityl (n=13); stearyl (n=15) and alcohol derivatives], the presence of a palmitol chain was associated with the highest efficacy against L3 (LC50 31.9-39.1 M). Alkylation of the 2-amino group with medium size fragments as ethyl or n-butyl showed the best larvicidal activity. The dialkylation did not improve efficacy. Aminoalcohols 4 and 6 showed the highest SI (1.5 and 1.6, respectively). With respect to diamine derivative compounds, a chain size of sixteen carbon atoms (palmitoyl chain, n=13), and the alkylation of the 2-amino group with medium-sized fragments, were associated with the highest lethal activities. The presence of carbamoyl group in diamines 17 and 18 yielded high SI (1.7 and 1.4, respectively). Infected mice treated with aminoalcohol 6 showed reduction in parthenogenetic females (59%) and eggs in faeces (51%). Conclusions: These results support the potentiality of aminoalcohol and diamine sphingosine-related compounds as suitable prototypes for developing new promising drugs against strongyloidiasis.

J	LOPES, MF; DAVEIGA, VF; SANTOS, AR; FONSECA, MEF; DOSREIS, GA								ACTIVATION-INDUCED CD4(+) T-CELL DEATH BY APOPTOSIS IN EXPERIMENTAL CHAGAS-DISEASE								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				154	2			744	752						JAN 15 1995	1995	Infection of mice with Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative protozoan agent of human Chagas' disease, leads to immunosuppression of the T cell compartment and to chronic cardiac inflammation which resembles the human infection. Recently, reinduction of programmed cell death by apoptosis in mature T cells has been demonstrated. It has been suggested that mature T cell apoptosis could play a role in immunosuppression caused by virus infection. In this report, we have investigated the occurrence of mature T cell apoptosis in murine experimental Chagas' disease. Infection with T. cruzi metacyclic forms led to a relative accumlation of CD8 T cells over CD4 T cells in the spleens of infected mice. Splenic T cells from T. cruzi-infected donors, but not from control littermates, died in vitro upon stimulation with T cell mitogens Con A and anti-TCR-alpha beta mAb in a dose-dependent fashion. DNA fragmentation into nucleosome-sized bands was detected in the supernatants of CD4(+) T cells from infected origin, after stimulation with the T cell mitogen Con A, Upon in vitro stimulation with either anti-TCR-ap or Con A, CD4(+) T cells were susceptible to elimination, whereas CD8(+) T cells were not. Splenic T cells from infected donors were markedly unresponsive to anti-TCR mAb in proliferative assays and underwent apoptosis in vitro, as assessed by electron microscopy. Apoptosis also occurred in vivo in the course of acute infection, as seen by DNA fragmentation in freshly explanted splenic cells and purified T cell subsets. The data indicate that activation-induced CD4(+) T cell death by apoptosis is a prominent feature of experimental infection with T. cruzi, and could play a role in immunosuppression and parasite persistence in infected hosts.

The human-pathogenic Lassa virus and several non-pathogenic arenaviruses such as Morogoro virus (MORV) share the same host species, namely Mastomys natalensis (M. natalensis). In this study, we investigated the history of infection and virus transmission within the natural host population. To this end, we infected M. natalensis at different ages with MORV and measured the health status of the animals, virus load in blood and organs, the development of virus-specific antibodies, and the ability of the infected individuals to transmit the virus. To explore the impact of the lack of evolutionary virus-host adaptation, experiments were also conducted with Mobala virus (MOBV), which does not share M. natalensis as a natural host. Animals infected with MORV up to two weeks after birth developed persistent infection, seroconverted and were able to transmit the virus horizontally. Animals older than two weeks at the time of infection rapidly cleared the virus. In contrast, MOBV-infected neonates neither developed persistent infection nor were able to transmit the virus. In conclusion, we demonstrate that MORV is able to develop persistent infection in its natural host, but only after inoculation shortly after birth. A related arenavirus that is not evolutionarily adapted to M. natalensis is not able to establish persistent infection. Persistently infected animals appear to be important to maintain virus transmission within the host population.																					WOS:000654579500001	34067011	
B	COHEN, A.; BELYAVIN, G.; NEWLAND, S. E.								Analysis of the horse serum inhibitor of A2 influenza virus haemagglutination and infectivity								VIIIth International Congress for Microbiology, Abstracts, Montreal, Quebec, Canada								95	p. 95						1962	1962	The potent prophylactic effect of normal horse serum in the experimental infection of mice with A2 strains of influenza virus prompted attempts to isolated and concentrate the active substance (gamma-inhibitor) which, from its inactivation by periodate, is believed to be a mucoprotein. Fractional precipitation with ammonium sulphate shows that inhibitory activity is present in all the protein fractions but the most active, per mg of N, are the water insoluble euglobulin and pseudoglobulin fractions which, electrophoretically, consist of gamma and alpha globulins. The inhibitory activity is not dissociable from the protein moiety by calcium phosphate column chromatography as are the virus inhibitory components of rabbit serum. Heating of the serum or its ammonium sulphate fractions at 70[degree]C for 1 hour increases their inhibitory activity as much as 9-fold. A highly active neutralizing fraction may thus be obtained by a combination of heat and ammonium sulphate-precipitation. 10% of the horse sera examined contained [alpha]-inhibitor with only small amounts of gamma present in the albumin fraction. The 2 types of inhibitory behavior found in individual horse sera may reflect a genetic trait which determines the type of serum mucoprotein synthesized. A similar mechanism in susceptible species might conceivably affect the level of nonspecific resistance to infection. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19634100019394		
J	Galabov, Angel S.; Simeonova, Lora; Gegova, Galina								Rimantadine and oseltamivir demonstrate synergistic combination effect in an experimental infection with type A (H3N2) influenza virus in mice								Antiviral Chemistry & Chemotherapy				17	5			251	258						2006	2006	We studied the combination effect of rimantadine hydrochloride and oseltamivir phosphate on mice infected with influenza A/Aichi/2/68 (H3N2) virus. Compounds were simultaneously administered in a 5-day-treatment course, starting 4 h before intranasal infection with 10 or 20 viral 50% mouse lethal doses. Initially, we tested combinations of oseltamivir (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg/day) and rimantadine (2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg/kg/day). Significant differences were recorded between combination-treated groups, and groups with separately applied compounds and the placebo group, such as: protection index of oseltamivir with 5.0 or 7.5 mg/kg rimantadine varied between 34-41% and 43-87%, respectively, whereas the individual effects of oseltamivir, 5 mg/kg of rimantadine and 7.5 mg/kg of rimantadine were 0-10%, 0% and 18.7-29.6%, respectively; mean survival time in combination-treated groups was lengthened by 3.1-6.9 days, in oseltamivir groups by 0-1.9 days, and in rimantadine groups by 0.8-1.3 days at 5 mg/kg and 2.6-3.2 days at 7.5 mg/kg. The three-dimensional method of Prichard and Shipman characterized the combination effect as synergistic. Further, we studied the activity of 0.05 mg/kg/day of oseltamivir combined with 5 mg/kg of rimantadine. Lung virus titre in Madin Darby canine kidney cells, lung index and consolidation score proved the high effectiveness of the combination. When compared with the placebo group, a 2.8 log(10) lower titre of 50% cell culture infectious dose (CCID50) was recorded in the combination-treated group at 48-60 h post-infection (the peak of lung virus growth). This is in contrast to the 0.1-1.0 log(10) and 1.1-1.4 log(10) reduction in CCID50 titre observed in the oseltamivir and rimantadine groups, respectively. These data emphasize the high anti-influenza A potential of the combination.																					BCI:BCI200700037838	17176629

Determinants of host susceptibility to murine respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) disease identify a role for the innate immunity scavenger receptor MARCO gene in human infants								EBIOMEDICINE				11				73	84		10.1016/j.ebiom.2016.08.011				SEP 2016	2016	Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the global leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants. Nearly 30% of all infected infants develop severe disease including bronchiolitis, but susceptibility mechanisms remain unclear.Methods: We infected a panel of 30 inbred strains of mice with RSV and measured changes in lung disease parameters 1 and 5 days post-infection and they were used in genome-wide association (GWA) studies to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) and susceptibility gene candidates.Findings: GWA identified QTLs for RSV disease phenotypes, and the innate immunity scavenger receptor Marco was a candidate susceptibility gene; targeted deletion of Marco worsened murine RSV disease. We characterized a human MARCO promoter SNP that caused loss of gene expression, increased in vitro cellular response to RSV infection, and associated with increased risk of disease severity in two independent populations of children infected with RSV.Interpretation: Translational integration of a genetic animal model and in vitro human studies identified a role for MARCO in human RSV disease severity. Because no RSV vaccines are approved for clinical use, genetic studies have implications for diagnosing individuals who are at risk for severe RSV disease, and disease prevention strategies (e.g. RSV antibodies).

In the study, we constructed hypoxic response elements (HRE) and the Tet-On advanced double-controlled systems and investigated their effects on the expression of hVEGF(165) and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) genes in rat cardiomyocytes exposed to hypoxia and pharmacologic induction. We infected neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with recombinant rAAV-rtTA-Rs-M2/rAAV-TRE-Tight-Ang-1 and rAAV-9HRE-hVEGF(165). Our results indicated that the viral titer was 1x10(12) vg /mL and the viral purity exceeded 98%. hVEGF(165) expression was induced by hypoxia, but not by normoxia (P < 0.001). Ang-1 expression was evident under doxycycline induction, but undetectable without doxycycline induction (P < 0.001). Immunofluorescence staining showed that positively stained hVEGF(165) and Ang-1 protein appeared only under both hypoxia and doxycycline induction. We demonstrate here that HRE and the recombinant Tet-On advanced double gene-controlled systems sensitively regulate the expression of hVEGF(165) and Ang-1 genes in an altered oxygen environment and under pharmacological induction in vitro.

Tacaribe-infected guinea pigs did not show detectable immunosuppression employing the same models. Similar results were found when the cell-mediated immunity was investigated. Tacaribe-infected guinea pigs had a normal immune response for contact sensitivity to 2,4-dinitro-1-fluorbenzene as demonstrated by measuring ear swelling and an unmodified tuberculin reaction after injection with complete Freund's adjuvant. The consideration of Tacaribe immunization as an approach to the prophylaxis of Argentine hemorrhagic fever is discussed.																					BCI:BCI198274010034	6101101

The adjuvanted G protein vaccine induced robust neutralization antibody responses comparable to those generated by live RSV infection. Importantly, adjuvanted G protein significantly reduced viral loads in both the lungs and nose at early time points following viral challenge. Antibody kinetics determined by Surface Plasmon Resonance showed that adjuvanted G generated 10-fold higher G-binding antibodies compared to non-adjvuanted G vaccine and live RSV infection, which correlated strongly with both neutralization titers and viral load titers in the nose and lungs post-viral challenge. Antibody diversity analysis revealed immunodominant antigenic sites in the N-and C-termini of the RSV-G protein, that were boosted > 10-fold by adjuvant and inversely correlated with viral load titers. Enhanced lung pathology was observed only in animals vaccinated with FI-RSV, but not in animals vaccinated with unadjuvanted or adjuvanted RSV-G vaccine after viral challenge. The bacterially produced unglycosylated G protein could be developed as a protective vaccine against RSV disease.																					WOS:000393806300001	28186208

The maximum values of the above cytokines were determined at the infection terminal stage. A reliably less pronounced growth of concentrations of IL-1 beta, TNF alpha and IL-10 was found in animals infected with a non-lethal TE dosage. The concentration of IL-6 in the blood serum of animals, infected with a non-lethal dosage of the virus, changed during the whole observation period. The dynamics of cytokines in the blood serum of mice, infected with a lethal dosage of the TE virus, suggests the development of SIRS at the infection terminal stage.

Stool, sera, and various tissues were collected from three rats each on days 0 (preinoculation) and 4, 7, 11, 14, 18, 21, 25, 28, and 35 postinoculation. Stool and sera specimens were examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of HEV genomic sequences. Tissues were examined by light microscopy for detection of histopathological changes and by direct immunofluorescence for detection of HEV antigens. We detected HEV RNA in stools on day 7 in all three animals and in serum intermittently between days 4 and 35. We found HEV antigens in liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and small intestine. We detected histopathology attributable to the inoculum in liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. The results confirm that HEV can replicate in laboratory rats and suggest new tissue sites for HEV replication. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.*																					WOS:A1996TU18900001	8835343

Infection with parasitic nematodes confounds vaccination efficacy								VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY				148	1	SI		14	20		10.1016/j.vetpar.2007.05.006				AUG 19 2007	2007	T helper (Th) cells produce signature cytokine patterns, induced largely by intracellular versus extracellular pathogens that provide the cellular and molecular basis for counter regulatory expression of protective immunity during concurrent infections. The production of IL- 12 and IFN-gamma, for example, resulting from exposure to many bacterial, viral, and protozoan pathogens is responsible for Th I derived protective responses that also can inhibit development of Th2-cells expressing IL-4-dependent immunity to extracellular helminth parasites and vice versa. In a similar manner, concurrent helminth infection alters optimal vaccine-induced responses in humans and livestock; however, the consequences of this condition have not been adequately studied especially in the context of a challenge infection following vaccination. Demands for new and effective vaccines to control chronic and emerging diseases, and the need for rapid deployment of vaccines for bio security concerns requires a systematic evaluation of confounding factors that limit vaccine efficacy. One common albeit overlooked confounder is the presence of gastrointestinal nematode parasites in populations of humans and livestock targeted for vaccination. This is particularly important in areas of the world were helminth infections are prevalent, but the interplay between parasites and emerging diseases that can be transmitted worldwide make this a global issue. In addition, it is not clear if the epidemic in allergic disease in industrialized countries substitutes for geohelminth infection to interfere with effective vaccination regimens. This presentation will focus on recent vaccination studies in mice experimentally infected with Heligmosomoides polygyrus to model the condition of gastrointestinal parasite infestation in mammalian populations targeted for vaccination. In addition, a large animal vaccination and challenge model against Mycoplasma hyopneumonia in swine exposed to Ascaris suum will provide a specific example of the need for further work in this area, and for controlled field studies to assess the impact of other similar scenarios.

However, they occasionally produce nonspecific reactions, thus making it difficult to reliably measure low levels of specific antibodies. To find a test method that minimizes nonspecific reactions, we introduced the principle of antibody-mediated complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) into an antibody assay. The procedure has three steps: (i) the mixing of test samples with a suspension of cells expressing the antigen of interest on their surfaces, (ii) the addition of rabbit complement, and (iii) the measurement of lactose dehydrogenase (LDH) activities by adding a chromogenic substrate to the reaction mixture. When the specific antibodies exist in the sample, complement activation triggered by antibody binding on the surface of the antigen-expressing cells may lyse the cells, releasing LDH into the medium. Mouse and rabbit sera hyperimmune to nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) lysed NS1-expressing cells in a dose-dependent manner. Evaluations using sera from horses naturally infected with JEV showed that the CDC assay had quantitative correlation and qualitative agreement with previously established NS1 antibody-detecting immunostaining and ELISA methods. The assay method also detected NS1 antibodies in sera of mice 2 days after experimental infection with JEV; specific, but not natural, immunoglobulin M antibodies were detected. Since almost all sera examined in this study showed no nonspecific reactions, the CDC assay was shown to be a reliable method for measuring low levels of specific antibodies.

J	ASPLIN, F. D.								Observations on the viability of Newcastle disease virus								VET REC				61	(13)			159	160						1949	1949	A strain of Newcastle disease virus was obtained from the skin of frozen eviscerated imported poultry. Newcastle disease virus survived on the skin of experimentally infected eviscerated carcasses stored at 34[degree]F for 96 days and in the bone marrow for 134 days. In un-plucked carcasses stored at the same temp., virus persisted on the skin for 160 days and in the bone marrow for 196 days. Virus persisted on the skin and in the bone marrow of both eviscerated and unplucked carcasses stored at -4[degree]F for longer than 300 days. Virus on filter paper exposed to dry conditions at incubator temp., 98[degree]F, was inactive after 12 hrs.; virus on egg shell at the same temp. was inactive after 44 hrs. Sterile feces exerted a protective effect on the virus at the same temp. Virus on paper or glass, stored at refrigerator temp., remained active for many months. Certain disinfectants were tested against Newcastle disease virus; lysol, 1% to 2.5%, and formalin under warm conditions were most effective. A pig inoculated intramusc. excreted virus for 48 hrs. and 2 rats inoculated by mouth excreted virus in the feces for 24 hrs. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19492300021538

To clarify apoptosis-related mechanisms, expression of apoptosis-related genes in the spinal cord of these rats was chronologically examined by means of a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Provirus expansion and increment of HTLV-I pX mRNA were evident at 7 months after the induced infection. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased gradually soon after pX expression. The expression of a major apoptosis-resistant gene, bcl-2, was markedly suppressed at a period of the provirus expansion and bax was also down-regulated. p53 was consistently expressed at high levels. These findings were never observed in spinal cords of HAM-resistant strains with HTLV-I infection even throughout their entire life. Collective evidence suggests that the local provirus expansion and deregulation of apoptosis-related genes, especially down-regulation of bcl-2, may lead to apoptosis of oligodendrocytes, thus being a major pathogenetic pathway in the HTLV-I-induced myeloneuropathy.

One limitation of the rabbit model is that after experimental infection of rabbits, clinical diarrhea is not routinely induced. Lack of diarrhea in the rabbit model has been proposed to be due to the fluid absorptive capability of the cecum or attenuation of virus strains through tissue culture adaptation. To test whether a wild-type lapine rotavirus strain SAP (BAPwt) isolated from diarrheic rabbits would cause disease on passage in rabbits. 1-, 2-, 10-, and 18-week-old rabbits were orally inoculated with BAPwt, its tissue culture-adapted counterpart strain (BAP-2), tissue culture-adapted lapine strain ALA, or PBS. Lapine rotavirus infection in 1-week-old, but not greater than or equal to 2-week-old, rabbits resulted in the development of disease characterized by soft, wet, yellow-to-brownish-green partially formed-to-liquid stools observed only at the time of virus antigen shedding. The level and duration of virus shedding after infection were prolonged in 1-week-old rabbits compared with rabbits greater than or equal to 2 weeks of age. Although diarrhea was not observed beyond the first 2 weeks of life, histopathological changes, including villus shortening and fusion, increased vacuolation of epithelial cells, and mononuclear infiltration of the lamina propria, were observed throughout the small intestine between 12 and 120 h after ALA infection in 1-week-old, 1- to 2-month-old, and 11-month-old rabbits. In 11-month-old rabbits, onset of intestinal damage appeared to be slightly delayed, was less severe, and was not observed in the duodenum. There were no differences in the immune responses to rotavirus infection in rabbits of different age groups (1 week to 5 years of age). All rapine rotavirus-inoculated rabbits seroconverted and were protected from virus challenge at 28 days postinoculation. Like in mice, rotavirus disease is age restricted in rabbits.

Medical Journal of Australia								150	155						1939, Jan. 28th	1939	The bandicoot Isoodon torosus Ramsay is susceptible to " Q " fever. Nine bandicoots were inoculated, and at least five became infected, as shown by the recovery of " Q " virus from the organs by guineapig inoculation.Infection is of the inapparent form. The only abnormality found post mortem was enlargement of the spleen. Infected bandicoots had a spleen size of from 0.61% to 1.10% of the body weight. The average size of the spleens of captured bandicoots was 0.51 % of the body weight.Inoculated bandicoots developed serum agglutinins against " Q " Rickettsiae.Of 44 uninoculated bandicoots tested for " Q " agglutination, four reacted. These had, therefore, been infected with " Q " fever in the bush. They show that the bandicoot is involved in the natural cycle of " Q " fever.Bandicoot sera which react to agglutination tests are also capable of protecting mice and guineapigs against infection with " Q " fever.The organs of 29 bandicoots were inoculated into guineapigs, but the infecting agent of " Q " fever was not obtained.Bandicoots carry a variety of ectoparasites: lice, fleas, ticks and mites. A large series of these have been inoculated into guineapigs, without result.																					CABI:19412202593

In the second group, semen, vaginal secretions, exudates and occasionally saliva have been documented as sources of transmission. If the skin, protected by the horny layer, does not seem easily infected, the mucous membrane and especially the vaginal, rectal or oral mucosa are the main sites of HIV entry in absence of lesions. In mucosa, a well identified population of dendritic cells may be considered as the first target of HIV1: the Langerhans cells. Originated from the bone marrow, the Langerhans cells migrate into the peripheral epithelia (skin, mucous membranes) and play a key role in the immune surveillance system against foreign antigens. They act as antigenpresenting cells through a specific cooperation with CD4(+) lymphocytes after migration to the proximal lymph nodes. As HIV1- susceptible cells, Langerhans cells in genital or rectal mucosa may be the first infected cell type and may be the vectors of infection for CD4 positive T cells. It is clearly demonstrated that LC may be infected in HIV1 seropositive patients. Recently in vitro, experimental infection of Langerhans cells was reproduced using a co-culture assay with HIV1 infected cells. Recent data obtained with transgenic mice containing HIV1 gene underline the key role of Langerhans cells in the pathogenesis process of HIV infection.

The vaccine against EV-A71 could potentially prevent virus-induced neurological complications and mortalities occurring due to the high risk of poliomyelitis-like paralysis and fatal encephalitis. It is known that polysaccharide purified from Ganoderma lucidum (PS-G) can effectively modulate immune function. Here, we used PS-G as an adjuvant with the EV-A71 mucosal vaccine and studied its effects. Our data showed that PS-G-adjuvanted EV-A71 generated significantly better IgA and IgG in the serum, saliva, nasal wash, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and feces. More importantly, these antibodies could neutralize the infectivity of EV-A71 (C2 genotype) and cross-neutralize the B4, B5, and C4 genotypes of EV-A71. In addition, more EV-A71-specific IgA- and IgG- secreting cells were observed with the used of a combination of EV-A71 and PS-G. Furthermore, T-cell proliferative responses and IFN-gamma and IL-17 secretions levels were notably increased in splenocytes when the EV-A71 vaccine contained PS-G. We also found that levels of IFN-gamma and IL-17 released in Peyers patch cells were significantly increased in EV-A71, after it was combined with PS-G. We further demonstrated that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were able to generate IFN-gamma and IL-17 in the spleen. An easy-accessed model of hybrid hSCARB2+/+/stat-1-/- mice was used for EV-A71 infection and pathogenesis. We infected the mouse model with EVA71, which was premixed with mouse sera immunized with the EV-A71 vaccine with or without PS-G. Indeed, in the EV-A71 + PS-G group, the levels of VP1-specific RNA sequences in the brain, spinal cord, and muscle decreased significantly. Finally, hSCARB2-Tg mice immunized via the intranasal route with the PS-G-adjuvanted EV-A71 vaccine resisted a subsequent lethal oral EV-A71 challenge. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PS-G could potentially be used as an adjuvant for the EV-A71 mucosal vaccine. Copyright: CC BY 4.0																					DRCI:DATA2020219020347685		
B	Tamosiunaite, A.								Cowpox virus virulence determinants.								Cowpox virus virulence determinants								91 pp.	91 pp.						2017	2017	New cowpox virus (CPXV) infections occur naturally in Germany in increasing numbers. It is striking that an infection of the pet rats with these newly occurring CPXV strains often leads to a lethal outcome. Likewise, a CPXV isolate from a pet rat that as well caused human infection in Southern Germany, RatPox09, causes severe disease in Wistar rats, whereas infection of rats with the well-characterized strain Brighton Red (BR) results only in mild symptoms. Nevertheless, these two strains are highly similar on genomic level: the calculated sequence identity between RatPox09 and BR is 92%. However, with the help of proteome similarity plots, six products with major differences between RatPox09 and BR were identified. Though, minor sequence modifications of unknown impact were found dispersed all over the genome too. The thesis at hand, concentrates on genomic differences between the two CPXV strains, mentioned above. First of all, we analyzed the sequence of the genes of major differences and we generated gain of function mutants with single or multiple genes exchanged. Secondly, for identification of additional virulence factors, we used a novel approach to generate BR-RatPox09 chimeric viruses with approximately 20-40 kbp genome segments exchanged. This was achieved by combining markerless en passant Red recombination and a classical method, homologous recombination in infected vertebrate cells. Since, these CPXV strains of different pathogenic potential in vivo; shows similar growth characteristics in vitro, animal model seems to be the only suitable method to test the virulence of the recombinant viruses. Nevertheless, in vivo models, are not favorable experimental models due to many reasons, including: aspects of animal protection, their long duration and high requirement of labor. In search of a way to reduce the need for animal experiments for testing new recombinant viruses, we evaluated a three-dimensional (3D) skin model as a possible surrogate for animal experiments. We monitored CPXV lesion formation, viral gene expression and cell cycle patterns after infection of 3D skin cultures with RatPox09 and BR. Infected 3D skin cultures exhibited histological alterations that were similar to those of mammal skin infections, but there were no differences in gene expression patterns and tissue damage between the two CPXV strains in the model system. To be brief, 3D skin cultures reflect the development of pox lesions in the human skin, but seem not to allow differentiation between more or less virulent virus strains, a distinction that is made possible by experimental infection in suitable animal models. Therefore, in vivo infection model was applied. CPXV RatPox09 and NMDAr and CrmE mutants, but not segment F chimera, infected rats attained significantly higher clinical scores than BAC derived BR or wt BR infected rats (p≤0.05, Anova). However, 6 out of the 8 RatPox09 infected Wistar rats had to be euthanized as their health deteriorated dramatically. Although only 2 out of 10 with BR_RatPox09 NMDAr and 1 out of 10 BR_RatPox09 CrmE infected rats succumbed to the disease. But none of CPXV BR and BR_RatPox09 sF infected rats did. Summing up the results, it can be concluded that, insertion of sequence of putative RatPox09 genes, NMDAr and CrmE, but not the genomic segment F, into strain BR, results in increase of pathogenicity. However, the insertion of these individual ORFs is not sufficient to recreate the pathological effect of RatPox09.																					CABI:20183050988

The animals were killed at 11-62 days post-infection (dpi) and samples of brain, heart, pancreas, kidney, Peyer's patches, spleen, lung and thymus were processed for virological, histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluation. This experimental infection was inapparent, but virus was isolated from faeces and several organs of all animals. The main histopathological changes were focal interstitial pancreatitis, degeneration and necrosis of pancreatic acinar cells, depletion of thymus and Peyer's patches, and interstitial pneumonia. EMCV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells, pancreatic acinar cells and hepatic epithelial cells, and in macrophages of the spleen, lung and thymus. In the heart (the target organ of EMCV in pigs), the presence of EMCV in cardiac muscle cells without lesions lends support to the hypothesis that the rat is a natural reservoir host species of EMCV. The persistence of virus in the macrophages of the thymus may represent a mechanism of perpetuation and reactivation, under immunosuppressive conditions, of the infection. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zhou, Haixia; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley								Autocrine Interferon Priming in Macrophages but Not Dendritic Cells Results in Enhanced Cytokine and Chemokine Production after Coronavirus Infection								MBIO				1	4					e00219-10	10.1128/mBio.00219-10				SEP-OCT 2010	2010	Coronaviruses efficiently inhibit interferon (IFN) induction in nonhematopoietic cells and conventional dendritic cells (cDC). However, IFN is produced in infected macrophages, microglia, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC). To begin to understand why IFN is produced in infected macrophages, we infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) and as a control, bone marrow-derived DC( BMDC) with the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). As expected, BMM but not BMDC expressed type I IFN. IFN production in infected BMM was nearly completely dependent on signaling through the alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptor (IFNAR). Several IFN-dependent cytokines and chemokines showed the same expression pattern, with enhanced production in BMM compared to BMDC and dependence upon signaling through the IFNAR. Exogenous IFN enhanced IFN-dependent gene expression in BMM at early times after infection and in BMDC at all times after infection but did not stimulate expression of molecules that signal through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Collectively, our results show that IFN is produced at early times postinfection (p.i.) in MHV-infected BMM, but not in BMDC, and primes expression of IFN and IFN-responsive genes. Further, our results also show that BMM are generally more responsive to MHV infection, since MyD88-dependent pathways are also activated to a greater extent in these cells than in BMDC.IMPORTANCE Coronaviruses cause diseases with various degrees of severity in humans, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In domestic and companion animals, coronaviruses induce interferon (IFN) in only a few cell types. In particular, macrophages, which are known to have both protective and pathogenic roles in coronavirus infections, express IFN while dendritic cells do not. Little is known about the basis of these cell-specific differences in IFN induction. Here, we show that an animal coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, induces IFN and other IFN-responsive molecules in macrophages, but not in dendritic cells, via a feedback loop that is dependent upon low-level IFN expression at early times after infection. This pathway of cellular activation may be a useful target for modulating macrophage function in order to selectively enhance the antivirus immune response and diminish the pathogenic role of these cells in SARS and other coronavirus infections.

This is a tropical disease originally described in central/east Africa in the 1960s, but its 2004 re-emergence in Africa and rapid spread in lands in and around the Indian Ocean (Reunion island, India, Malaysia) as well as Europe (Italy) led to almost 6 million cases worldwide. The risk of importation and spreading diseases with long-term sequelae is even greater today given the global distribution of the vectors (including in the Americas), increased tourism and the apparent capacity of CHIKV to produce high levels of viremia (10(9)-10(12) virus/ml of blood) and new mutants. CHIKV-associated neuropathology was described early in the 1960s, but it is the unprecedented incidence rate in Indian Ocean areas with efficient clinical facilities that allowed a better description of cases with severe encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, peripheral neuropathies and deaths among newborns (mother-to-child infection), infants and elderly patients. Death rates following CHIKV infection were estimated at 1:1000 cases in la Reunion's outbreak. These clinical observations have been corroborated by experimental infection in several mouse models, leading to CNS pathologies. We further describe in this review the capacity of CHIN to infect neurons and glial cells, delineate the fundamental innate (intrinsic) immune defence mechanisms to protect from infection and argue about the possible mechanisms involved in the encephalopathy.

The ability of synthetic beta-sheet self-assembling peptides to stabilize antigenic determinants and to potentiate the epitope-specific immune responses have highlighted their potential as an immunostimulating platform for antigen delivery. Nonetheless, the intrinsic polymorphism of the resulting cross-beta fibrils, their length in the microscale and their close structural similarity with pathological amyloids could limit their usage in vaccinology. In this study, we harnessed electrostatic capping motifs to control the self-assembly of a chimeric peptide comprising a 10-mer beta-sheet sequence and a highly conserved epitope derived from the influenza A virus (M2e). Self-assembly led to the formation of 100-200 nm long uniform nanorods (NRs) displaying the M2e epitope on their surface. These cross-beta assemblies differed from prototypical amyloid fibrils owing to low polydispersity, short length, non-binding to thioflavin T and Congo Red dyes, and incapacity to seed homologous amyloid assembly. M2e-NRs were efficiently uptaken by antigen presenting cells and the cross-beta quaternary architecture activated the Toll-like receptor 2 and stimulated dendritic cells. Mice subcutaneous immunization revealed a robust M2e-specific IgG response, which was dependent on self-assembly into NRs. Upon intranasal immunization in combination with the polymeric adjuvant montanide gel, M2e-NRs conferred complete protection with absence of clinical signs against a lethal experimental infection with the H1N1 influenza A virus. These findings indicate that by acting as an immunostimulator and delivery system, synthetic peptide-based NRs constitute a versatile self-adjuvanted nanoplatform for the delivery of subunit vaccines.

In this study, baseline and postvaccination serum samples of individuals aged 18 years and older who received a recombinant H7 hemagglutinin vaccine with and without an oil-in-water emulsion (SE) adjuvant were analyzed using a panel of serological assays. While only a small proportion of individuals seroconverted to H7N9 as measured by the conventional hemagglutination inhibition assay, our data show strong induction of anti-H7 hemagglutinin antibodies as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, cross-reactive antibodies against phylogenetically distant group 2 hemagglutinins were induced, presumably targeting the conserved stalk domain of the hemagglutinin. Further analysis confirmed an induction of stalk-specific antibodies, suggesting that epitopes outside the classical antigenic sites are targeted by this vaccine in the context of preexisting immunity to related H3 hemagglutinin. Antibodies induced by H7 vaccination also showed functional activity in antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reporter assays and microneutralization assays. Additionally, our data show that sera from hemagglutination inhibition seroconverters conferred protection in a passive serum transfer experiment against lethal H7N9 virus challenge in mice. Interestingly, sera from hemagglutination inhibition nonseroconverters also conferred partial protection in the lethal animal challenge model. In conclusion, while recombinant H7 vaccination fails to induce measurable levels of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies in most subjects, this vaccination regime induces homosubtypic and heterosubtypic cross-reactive binding antibodies that are functional and partly protective in a murine passive transfer challenge model.IMPORTANCE Zoonotic infections with high case fatality rates caused by avian H7N9 influenza viruses have been reported since early 2013 in China. Since then, the fifth wave of the H7N9 epidemic emerged in China, resulting in higher numbers of laboratory-confirmed cases than in previous years. Recently, H7N9 has started to antigenically drift and split into two new lineages, the Pearl River Delta and Yangtze River Delta clades, which do not match stockpiled H7 vaccines well. Humans are immunologically naive to these subtypes, and an H7N9 strain that acquires the capability of efficient human-to-human transmission poses a credible pandemic threat. Other characteristics of H7N9 are raising concerns as well, like its ability to bind to receptors in the human upper respiratory tract, the recent emergence of highly pathogenic variants, and the ability to quickly gain resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors. Therefore, developing and testing H7N9 vaccines constitutes a priority for pandemic preparedness.																					WOS:000505036000010	29242836

A total of 47 sheep were used.lnitially, 26 sheep received an intramuscular injection of a suspension of virus (titre: 10(6.8) 50% lethal dose for mice by the intracerebral route). Half of the sheep were subsequently treated using a vaccine on the day of infection and at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days post-infection. The remaining half comprised the unvaccinated controls. This vaccination protected seven of thirteen sheep, while nine of the thirteen controls died.Subsequently, 21 sheep were inoculated under the same conditions as in the previous trial, The animals were divided into three groups of seven animals each. The first group was vaccinated in the same way as described above. The second group received an injection of and-rabies immunoglobulin of human origin (26.3 IU/kg of body weight), followed by the course of vaccine treatment 24 hours later The remaining group acted as unvaccinated controls Of the seven sheep given vaccine alone, four were protected while all seven animals given immunoglobulin and vaccine were protected. Six of the seven untreated controls died.In this study, no apparently-healthy carriers or rabies virus were created by any of the treatments used, nor was there any shortening of the incubation periods.Additional observations were made concerning incubation periods and the course of the disease as well as symptoms, lesions and the presence of rabies virus in various nerve centres and salivary glands of the experimental sheep.

Two inbred mouse strains (BALB/c and A/J) with different genetic backgrounds were inoculated with the avian coronavirus strains Mass and BR-I and monitored for at least 10 days. Analysis of viral RNA, histopathological examinations, immunohistochemistry and serology were performed. After virus inoculation, neither clinical signs nor evident gross lesions were observed. Viral RNA, histopathological changes, and viral nucleoprotein were observed in the lung, trachea and sinus of all inoculated mice. Our study demonstrates the importance of elucidating the epidemiology of coronaviruses, including in rodents that are pests in poultry production.																					WOS:000356100800018	25951972

The strains differentiated as to their pathogenicity for mice. They were best and most easily cultivated on boiled blood agar. They seem to be the causative agents of the influenza in animals. Further study must decide whether a preceding cold has to be regarded as a "provocative factor." The author believes that obligatory hemoglobinophilia and need for X and V factors in the media have been overestimated as characteristics of influenza-causing agents and has delayed a comprehensive study of influenza-like diseases in animals. Blood or blood constituents in media are growth improving factors. Strict hemoglobinophilia may occasionally be of diagnostic value, but it should not be overlooked that transitional forms from obligatory to facultative hemoglobinophilia are found in single strains of a hemoglobinophilous species or species of the whole group. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L.

The Immuno-stimulating Drugs Application for Specific Prophylaxis of Infectious Diseases								RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES				9	3			540	546						MAY-JUN 2018	2018	The aim of this work was to study the use of xymedon and miyelopid hydrochloride to increase the specific prophylaxis effectiveness of rabies and listeriosis in animals. The experiments were carried out on rabbits and guinea pigs immunized with rabies inactivated vaccine from the Shchyolkovo-51 strain and ive vaccine against listeriosis of farm animals from the AUF strain. The xymedon hydrochloride and polypeptide, B-activin (myelopid), were used as immunostimulating drugs. The immune status assessment of animals due to vaccines and immunostimulating agents was carried out by studying the dynamics of hematological, serological and biochemical blood value, phagocytic activity of leukocytes, bactericidal properties of blood serum according to conventional methods. The increase of protective effect when using an antirabic vaccine in combination with xymedon hydrochloride, which was accompanied by an increase in the number of T-helpers, T-lymphocytes and an increase in the titer of specific virus neutralizing antibodies, was established. The intensity of immune response in immunodeficient animal immunized against rabies twice in the combination of xymedon hydrochloride was higher than in animals immunized once with only one vaccine. The analysis of these rabbits blood tests showed that the double intramuscular mielopid administration and a single administration of xymedon hydrochloride in combination with the vaccine against listeriosis from the AUF strain causes a significant increase in the natural and immunological resistance of experimental animals. It is confirmed by the study results of clinical state, blood parameters and experimental infection of test animals. The generalized analysis of these experimental studies gives grounds to say about the prospects of the xymedon and myeloid (B-activin) hydrochloride use in order to stimulate the immunological process in organism of animals after vaccination against infectious diseases.

Although it is known that infections can cause transient thymic involution, the impact of infection-induced thymus atrophy on thymic Treg (tTreg) cell development is unknown. Here, we infected mice with influenza A virus (IAV) and studied thymocyte population dynamics post infection. IAV infection caused a massive, but transient thymic involution, dominated by a loss of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive (DP) thymocytes, which was accompanied by a significant increase in the frequency of CD25(+)Foxp3(+) tTreg cells. Differential apoptosis susceptibility could be experimentally excluded as a reason for the relative tTreg cell increase, and mathematical modeling suggested that enhanced tTreg cell generation cannot explain the increased frequency of tTreg cells. Yet, an increased death of DP thymocytes and augmented exit of single-positive (SP) thymocytes was suggested to be causative. Interestingly, IAV-induced thymus atrophy resulted in a significantly reduced T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire diversity of newly produced tTreg cells. Taken together, IAV-induced thymus atrophy is substantially altering the dynamics of major thymocyte populations, finally resulting in a relative increase of tTreg cells with an altered TCR repertoire.

Intrapericardial delivery of full-length dystrophin produces restitution in dystrophic hearts								Society for Neuroscience Abstracts				26	1-2			Abstract No.	91.7						2000	2000	Here we report the first in vivo restitution of dystrophin in mdx (dystrophin-deficient) mouse hearts. The genetic defect responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) is dystrophin deficiency. Dystrophin gene delivery to the heart has the potential to prevent the cardiomyopathy that develops in patients with DMD and can be the predominant clinical feature in BMD. Delivery of truncated dystrophin is attractive because the large dystrophin cDNA (14 kb) cannot be accommodated by all viral vectors. However, the fact that some BMD patients experience a predominant cardiomyopathy despite native expression of truncated dystrophin suggests that delivery of truncated dystrophin to DMD patients may not constitute effective therapy. Thus, we infected mdx hearts in vivo using an MCK-driven high capacity adenoviral vector (Ad) containing the full-length dystrophin gene (AdDYS). Since expression from MCK-driven promoters is reported to be less in cardiac muscle than in skeletal muscle, we infected other hearts with a first-generation Ad expressing CMV-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein (AdEGFP). Vector (AdDYS or AdEGFP; 2 x 1010 viral particles in 50 mul), together with the enzymes collagenase and hyaluronidase, was injected, via an abdominal incision, transdiaphragmatically into the pericardial sac. This route exposes a greater area of the heart to vector and is less damaging than intracardiac injections, and offers longer exposure time to vector than intravascular gene delivery. After 14 days, animals were sacrificed and their hearts histologically processed, sectioned and stained with an antibody to dystrophin or viewed for EGFP fluorescence. Dystrophin was restored in 30-35% of the myocardium. CMV-driven EGFP expression was twice that of dystrophin (n=4). Since contractility in mdx hearts is 40-60% less than in the wild-type, dystrophin restitution may recover part of this lost contractility and rescue the heart.

Development of an aciclovir implant for the effective long-term control of herpes simplex virus type-1 infection in Vero cells and in experimentally infected SKH-1 mice								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS				30	5			428	435		10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2007.07.003				NOV 2007	2007	Human herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) is treatable with oral doses of an antiviral agent such as aciclovir (ACV), a drug that has poor bioavailability. An alternative for delivering ACV would employ a long-lived subcutaneous implant that would allow for near zero-order drug delivery kinetics. This study aimed to develop an implant composed of a matrix of silicone and ACV that is capable of sustained long-term release of ACV. Once the implants had been created, release of ACV from the implants was determined and quantified in vitro using a spectrophotometric assay for the drug. Solvent-exposed surface area of the implant (2.86 mm(2), 6.28 mm(2), 34.62 mm(2) and 100.48 mm(2)) had a significant effect on release kinetics, whereas temperature (37 degrees C, 25 degrees C and 4 degrees C) and pH (6.0, 7.0 and 8.0) did not. The implants were also used successfully to suppress HSV-1 (KOS)-induced cytopathic effect in cultured Vero cells. The implants protected HSV-1-infected SKH-1 mice from viral reactivation (n = 37; P = 0.0367) via ultraviolet light compared with mice that were untreated (n = 37). Furthermore, mice that received silicone-only implants had no lowered risk of reactivation (n = 34; P = 0.7268), demonstrating the antiviral efficacy of the ACV implants.

However, the exact causative agent was not recognized until July of 1990, when Ibaraki disease virus was first isolated from cerebellum of a cattle with nonsuppurative encephalitis in Chia-Yi district in Taiwan. During the prevailing period of the disease, epidemiological survey was conducted on 72 young calves aged under 1 year, from 8 farms located in Chia-Yi district. Result showed that 10 calves (14%) suffered from the disease. Nine sick calves culled or died within a few days after the onset of clinical signs. Virus isolation was further performed on 73 blood samples from epizootic farms, and results showed that 28 plasma samples and 11 blood cell samples contained the Orbivirus, respectively. During the period of September to October, virus were isolated from the nasal discharge and blood of infected cattle, with the symptoms mainly in the respiratory tracts, of two farms in Ping-tun. Furthermore, Orbivirus was also isolated from a newborn calf with nurvous signs in Kaohsiung district in December of 1991. The viruses isolated from field cases were pathogenic to suckling mice. Experimental infection of isolated virus to cattle also induced clinical sign in respiratory tract. Furthermore, virus could be recovered from blood of the infected cattle even 54 days post inoculation. A four consecutive years of serological survey on antibodies against Ibaraki disease in cattle in Taiwan was conducted from 1987 to 1990. The antibody-positive rate of dairy cattle in Taiwan increased from 25% in 1987 to 85% in 1990. The result indicated that the disease was epizootic in cattle population in Taiwan. This is the first report of the occurrence of Ibaraki disease in Taiwan.																					BCI:BCI199699233151

Zika Virus Infection Induces Elevation of Tissue Factor Production and Apoptosis on Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				10						817	10.3389/fmicb.2019.00817				APR 24 2019	2019	Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is typically characterized by a mild disease presenting with fever, maculopapular rash, headache, fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia. A recent animal study found that ZIKV-infected pregnant Ifnar(-/-) mice developed vascular damage in the placenta and reduced amount of fetal capillaries. Moreover, ZIKV infection causes segmental thrombosis in the umbilical cord of pregnant rhesus macaques. Furthermore, several case reports suggest that ZIKV infection cause coagulation disorders. These results suggest that ZIKV could cause an alteration in the host hemostatic response, however, the mechanism has not been investigated thus far. This paper aims to determine whether ZIKV infection on HUVECs induces apoptosis and elevation of tissue factor (TF) that leads to activation of secondary hemostasis. We infected HUVECs with two ZIKV strains and performed virus titration, immunostaining, and flow cytometry to confirm and quantify infection. We measured TF concentrations with flow cytometry and performed thrombin generation test (TGT) as a functional assay to assess secondary hemostasis. Furthermore, we determined the amount of cell death using flow cytometry. We also performed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to determine interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 production and conducted blocking experiments to associate these cytokines with TF expression. Both ZIKV strains infected and replicated to high titers in HUVECs. We found that infection induced elevation of TF expressions. We also showed that increased TF expression led to shortened TGT time. Moreover, the data revealed that infection induced apoptosis. In addition, there was a significant increase of IL-6 and IL-8 production in infected cells. Here we provide in vitro evidence that infection of HUVECs with ZIKV induces apoptosis and elevation of TF expression that leads to activation of secondary hemostasis.

We also found that wild type p53-induced apoptosis is blocked by bcl-2 in a mouse T lymphoma line (Wang et al., Oncogene, 8, 3427-3431, 1993) The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) can protect Burkitt lymphoma cells from apoptosis induced by low serum, In order to test if LMP1 can block p53-triggered apoptosis, we infected BL41 cells expressing the ts p53 construct with an LMP1-carrying retrovirus, The LMP1-expressing BL41-ts p53 cells were arrested in G1 upon induction of wild type p53 expression at 32 degrees C, but did not enter apoptosis as shown by the absence of positive TUNEL staining, WAF1/p21 mRNA was induced at 32 degrees C in both the ts p53-expressing and ts p53/LMP1-expressing BL41 cells, Thus, LMP1 prevents p53-induced apoptosis but does not interfere induction of WAF1/p21, The LMP1-infected expressed elevated bcl-2 protein levels, Therefore, our data suggest that LMP1 blocks p53-triggered apoptosis but not G1 arrest by upregulating bcl-2 expression.

While many chemokines can act on lymphocytes, the roles of chemokines and their receptors in lymphocyte biology are poorly understood. The recent discoveries that chemokines can suppress infection by HIV-1 and that chemokine receptors serve, along with CD4, as obligate co-receptors for HIV-1 entry have lent urgency to studies on the relationships between chemokines and lymphocytes. My laboratory has characterized Mig and Crg-2/IP-10, chemokines that are induced by IFN-gamma and that specifically target lymphocytes, particularly activated T cells. We have demonstrated that the genes for these chemokines are widely expressed during experimental infections in mice with protozoan and viral pathogens, but that the patterns of mig and crg-2 expression differed, suggesting non-redundant roles in vivo. Our related studies to identify new chemokine receptors from activated lymphocytes resulted in the cloning of STRL22 and STRL33. We and others have shown that STRL22 is a receptor for the CC chemokine MIP-3 alpha, and STRL22 has been renamed CCR6. Although STRL33 remains an orphan receptor, we have shown that it can function as a co-receptor for HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, and that it is active with a broader range of HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins than the major co-receptors described to date. The ability of STRL33 to function with a wide variety of envelope glycoproteins may become particularly important if therapies are instituted to block other specific co-receptors. We presume that investigations into the roles of chemokines and their receptors in lymphocyte biology will provide information important for understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS and for manipulating immune and inflammatory responses for clinical benefit.

East Asian Akabane virus strains are subdivided into genogroups I and II, and the former can also cause non-suppurative encephalomyelitis in post-natal animals. Specific detection of the infecting virus in tissues is essential for accurate diagnosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been used to identify viral antigen but cannot always detect specific viruses due to potential cross-reactivity of the primary antisera. We compared in-situ hybridization (ISH), based on the use of cocktail probe sets targeted at the RNA of each virus, with IHC for the detection of the specific viruses in tissues of suckling rats inoculated intracerebrally with Akabane (KM-1 or OBE-1 strains), Aino or Peaton viruses at 3 or 7 days of age. Most inoculated rats developed severe neurological signs and histopathological brain lesions including necrosis, spongy degeneration and non-suppurative inflammation. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum immunolabelled antigen of all three viruses within the lesions, whereas ISH specifically detected RNA of each individual virus. The distribution of viral RNA was comparable to that of viral antigens, but tended to be more widespread, especially in immature nervous tissue. Viral antigen and RNA were detected in skeletal muscle and heart of the rats infected with the KM-1 strain of Akabane virus but not with any of the other viruses. This study demonstrates the value of ISH detection of these viruses in a rat model and may prove useful for clarification of the pathogenesis of post-natal arbovirus infection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

Voprosy Virusologii				48	5			34	38						September-October 2003	2003	The specificity of lethal infection was studied in noninbred white mice (age - 15 to 20 and 25 to 30 days) infected intraperitoneally with the EP-2 strain of cowpox virus (CPV) in doses 105, 106 and 107 PFU. The virus caused the lethal infection in the 15-20-day mice; while the 25-30-day mice remained healthy and survived. Virologic, immunologic-and-histochemical and electron-microscopy examinations of the 15-20-day mice revealed a replication of the EP-2 strain in tissues bordering on the virus introduction area; there was no generalization of infection. The virus replicated first in the mesothelium cells, and after that, in fibroblasts as well as in the endothelial, fatty, adventicial, cross-striated and muscle cells and in myosatellites.

Serological Evidence for a Hepatitis E Virus-Related Agent in Goats in the United States								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES				60	6			538	545		10.1111/tbed.12001				DEC 2013	2013	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes an important public health disease in many developing countries and is also endemic in some industrialized countries. In addition to humans, strains of HEV have been genetically identified from pig, chicken, rat, mongoose, deer, rabbit and fish. While the genotypes 1 and 2 HEV are restricted to humans, the genotypes 3 and 4 HEV are zoonotic and infect humans and other animal species. As a part of our ongoing efforts to search for potential animal reservoirs for HEV, we tested goats from Virginia for evidence of HEV infection and showed that 16% (13/80) of goat sera from Virginia herds were positive for IgG anti-HEV. Importantly, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies to HEV were present in selected IgG anti-HEV positive goat sera. Subsequently, in an attempt to genetically identify the HEV-related agent from goats, we conducted a prospective study in a closed goat herd with known anti-HEV seropositivity and monitored a total of 11 kids from the time of birth until 14weeks of age for evidence of HEV infection. Seroconversion to IgG anti-HEV was detected in seven of the 11 kids, although repeated attempts to detect HEV RNA by a broad-spectrum nested RT-PCR from the faecal and serum samples of the goats that had seroconverted were unsuccessful. In addition, we also attempted to experimentally infect laboratory goats with three well-characterized mammalian strains of HEV but with no success. The results indicate that a HEV-related agent is circulating and maintained in the goat population in Virginia and that the goat HEV is likely genetically very divergent from the known HEV strains.

Indian Journal of Medical Research				52	7			727	734						undated	1966	An outbreak of febrile illness with haemorrhagic manifestations and several deaths occurred in Calcutta in the second half of 1963 and the early part of 1964. There were striking similarities between this outbreak and others observed in recent years in the Philippines and particularly in Thailand (Siam) [R.A.E., B 50 54]. Various aspects of research into the aetiology of the disease and the agent of spread in Calcutta are dealt with in these papers.Virological and serological studies that indicated at least two viruses to have been independently associated with the outbreak, an unidentified dengue-type group-B virus mainly in the earlier weeks and chikungunya virus later [cf. 50 55, etc.], are described in the first paper. One isolation of chikungunya virus was also made from females of Aedes sp. that had been caught in the city.The second paper contains an account of studies designed to compare the potentialities of Aedes albopictus (Skuse), A. aegypti (L.), A. polynesiensis Marks and Culex pipiens fatigans[Culex quinquefasciatus] Wied. (C. fatigans) as vectors of the Calcutta strain of chikungunya virus. The first two species and the last are widely distributed in India, and the first is found in peridomestic as well as sylvatic habitats. Females of laboratory strains were given infecting feeds of defibrinated chicken blood containing sugar solution and infected mouse brain. When females of A. albopictus of a strain probably originating in Hawaii were dissected on each of the 14 days after the infective feed, all of 32 tested on the 14th day and 32 of 35 examined on the earlier days, were infected; 11 of 29 females that fed on day-old mice on the 14th day after the infective feed transmitted the virus to the mice, but none of 10 feeding on the 5th-12th days did so; mosquitos with higher titres tended to transmit the virus more often than did those with lower ones. Infection rates obtained with A. aegypti of strains from Lagos (Nigeria) and Trinidad were lower than those obtained with A. albopictus, but the titres of infected females were generally higher. A female of the Lagos strain of A. aegypti transmitted virus 14 days and females of the Trinidad strain 5, 12 and 14 days after the infective feed. Infection was established in 18 out of 26 females of A. polynesiensis originating from Samoa but not in any of 28 females of C. p. fatigans originating from the Philippines.In the third paper, notes are given on the bionomics of A. aegypti and A. albopictus, and an Aedes survey made in November 1963 in Calcutta is described. Larvae and adults were systematically sought in the city and in the airport and seaport areas. The airport with its rural or semi-urban surroundings was a typical area for A. albopictus and provided many suitable breeding sites for mosquitos; A. aegypti was also found and could evidently establish itself there. The indices of A. aegypti (percentages of premises or barges searched in which adults and larvae were found) in the city and seaport areas were high, although the survey was made late in the year when its density was presumably declining. Because of this and the close contact of the mosquito with man, it could probably have been responsible for the transmission of both dengue and chikungunya viruses. A. albopictus was present in small numbers in the city. Mosquito control organizations exist in all three areas, but operations in the city are not planned to deal with Aedes and routine practices in both the port areas make inspection and effective action difficult. Suggested measures include improvement of storage and drainage, the prohibition of berthing of unused and unserviceable boats on the shore line, regulation of water storage on barges, inspection and control of berthed ships and extension of regulations requiring the spraying of aircraft arriving from the west and via Bangkok to include all aircraft from abroad. The local strain of A. aegypti shows increased tolerance of DDT (probably vigour tolerance), the LC50 for females with exposure for an hour being more than 4 per cent., but it is not refractory to control by the usual dosage of l g. per sq. metre. Spraying should be restricted to two rounds per year to avoid acceleration of selection of a resistant strain.The fourth paper is a review of the literature on natural and experimental infections of mosquitos with dengue and chikungunya viruses. It includes the results of previously published work by the author in collaboration with K. R. P. Singh & K. M. Pavri in which the Calcutta strain of chikungunya virus was seen to be present in all of 24 females of A. aegypti and of A. albopictus and eight of 23 of Anopheles stephensi List, ten days after they had fed on infected infant mice, but in none of 23 of C. p. fatigans, and was transmitted by bite to infant mice by 20 of 40 females of Aedes aegypti and 11 of 21 of A. albopictus but not by females of the other two species.In the concluding review of the situation as revealed in the papers noticed and others published with them, attention is drawn to the potential gravity of the appearance of haemorrhagic illness of the type in question in south-eastern Asia. Although there are good prospects, if the infection is mosquito-borne, of keeping the situation under control so long as the vectors remain susceptible to synthetic insecticides, the danger of the development of resistant strains is considerable and the implications of this are serious.

Revue scientifique et technique (International Office of Epizootics)				14	3			691	710						1995-Sep	1995	The objectives of this study were to examine the humoral immune response of sheep to experimental infection with an isolate of rabies virus from a fox, to analyse the efficacy of vaccination as a method of post-infection treatment, and to find a suitable animal model to evaluate new procedures for human vaccination following infection. A total of 47 sheep were used. Initially, 26 sheep received an intramuscular injection of a suspension of virus (titre: 10(6.8) 50% lethal dose for mice by the intracerebral route). Half of the sheep were subsequently treated using a vaccine on the day of infection and at 3, 7, 14 and 30 days post-infection. The remaining half comprised the unvaccinated controls. This vaccination protected seven of thirteen sheep, while nine of the thirteen controls died. Subsequently, 21 sheep were inoculated under the same conditions as in the previous trial. The animals were divided into three groups of seven animals each. The first group was vaccinated in the same way as described above. The second group received an injection of anti-rabies immunoglobulin of human origin (26.3 IU/kg of body weight), followed by the course of vaccine treatment 24 hours later. The remaining group acted as unvaccinated controls. Of the seven sheep given vaccine alone, four were protected, while all seven animals given immunoglobulin and vaccine were protected. Six of the seven untreated controls died. In this study, no apparently-healthy carriers of rabies virus were created by any of the treatments used, nor was there any shortening of the incubation periods. Additional observations were made concerning incubation periods and the course of the disease, as well as symptoms, lesions and the presence of rabies virus in various nerve centres and salivary glands of the experimental sheep.

The cane mouse, Zygodontomys brevicauda, is a natural host of Guanarito virus (family Arenaviridae), the etiologic agent of Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the natural history of Guanarito virus infection in Z. brevicauda. Thirty-nine laboratory-reared cane mice each were inoculated subcutaneously with 3.0 log(10) plaque-forming units of the Guanarito virus prototype strain INH-95551, No lethality was associated with infection in any animal, regardless of age at inoculation. The 13 newborn, 14 weanling, and 8 of the 12 adult animals developed chronic viremic infections characterized by persistent shedding of infectious virus in oropharyngeal secretions and urine. These findings indicate that Guanarito virus infection in Z. brevicauda can be chronic and thus support the concept that this rodent species is the natural reservoir of Guanarito virus.

Electroporation facilitates introduction of reporter transgenes and virions into schistosome eggs.								PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases				4	2			1	10						February 2010	2010	Background: The schistosome egg represents an attractive developmental stage at which to target transgenes because of the high ratio of germ to somatic cells, because the transgene might be propagated and amplified by infecting snails with the miracidia hatched from treated eggs, and because eggs can be readily obtained from experimentally infected rodents. Methods/Findings: We investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules including fluorescent (Cy3) short interference (si) RNA molecules, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. First, eggs were incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square wave electroporation. Cy3-signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Second, electroporation was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs. Luciferase activity was detected three hours later, whereas luciferase was not evident in eggs soaked in the mRNA. Third, schistosome eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Proviral transgenes were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs, indicating the presence of transgenes in larval schistosomes that had been either soaked or electroporated. However, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis determined that electroporation of virions resulted in 2[long dash]3 times as many copies of provirus in these schistosomes compared to soaking alone. In addition, relative qPCR indicated a copy number for the proviral luciferase transgene of,20 copies for 100 copies of a representative single copy endogenous gene (encoding cathepsin D). Conclusions: Square wave electroporation facilitates introduction of transgenes into the schistosome egg. Electroporation was more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped MLV than simply soaking the eggs in virions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.																					ZOOREC:ZOOR14607048573

In a previous study, we reported that administration of DHEA significantly decreased the numbers of blood parasites in Trypanosoma cruzi experimental infection. The present study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of DHEA in reducing the severity of acute phase T cruzi infection of male and female Wistar rats. Animals were treated subcutaneously with 40 mg/kg body weight/day of DHEA. The concentration of nitric oxide (NO) was determined in spleen peritoneal cavity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were determined in the sera of uninfected and infected animals. DHEA treatment augments NO production for both sexes after in vitro LPS treatment for uninfected animals. Infection triggered enhanced NO levels although not significant. IL-2 and IFN-gamma were detectable in higher concentrations in treated and infected rats of both genders when compared to untreated controls. These data suggest that DHEA may have a potent immunoregulatory function that can affect the course of T cruzi infection. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Studies on transovarial transmission of St. Louis encephalitis virus by Culex quinquefasciatus Say								AMER J HYG				80	(2)			254	265						1964	1964	Transovarial transmission of St. Louis encephalitis virus was investigated, using experimentally infected Culex quinquefasciatus. The virus could not be detected in eggs laid within 8 days of the infected blood meal; however, up to 92% of egg rafts laid later, after subsequent normal blood meals, contained virus. Although most of the virus was proven to be on the outer surface of the eggs, infection of an occasional larva, including one hatched from surface-sterilized eggs, suggested that virus could be inside the eggs also. The infection rate of the immature stages was low, approximately 1/1000. None of over 10,000 adult F1 males and females contained detectable virus, despite attempts to stimulate "latent" infections by varied incubation periods and normal blood meals. Other attempts to reveal latent virus through depression or enhancement of "superimposed" SLE infections also failed. It is concluded that a successful virus-overwintering mechanism probably would have to be more efficient than indicated by the present studies. Transovarial transmission by C. quinquefasciatus appears to be an unlikely means of perpetuating SLE virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19654600022510	14215836	
J	Melaine, N; Ruffault, A; Dejucq-Rainsford, N; Jegou, B								Experimental inoculation of the adult rat testis with Sendai virus: effect on testicular morphology and leukocyte population								HUMAN REPRODUCTION				18	8			1574	1579		10.1093/humrep/deg323				AUG 2003	2003	BACKGROUND: Surprisingly little is known about the interactions between viruses and the male uro-genital tract. These are important, as viral testicular orchitis, induced by mumps or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for example, can lead to sterility. Moreover, semen is an essential vector in the propagation of sexually transmissible viral diseases. Here, we studied the effects of testicular infection with Sendai virus, a virus related to mumps virus, on the cellular distribution of viral particles and on testicular morphology, with particular attention to the testicular leukocyte population. METHODS: At 5, 9, 11 or 24 h post-injection of Sendai virus through the scrotum, the testes were fixed for morphological and immunohistological studies. Localization of virus particles and numeration of leukocytes were performed using specific antibodies and morphological criteria. RESULTS: As early as 5 h post-injection, a rapid and massive infiltration of leukocytes was observed in the interstitial tissue. The peritubular cell layer and the most external part of the basal portion of the seminiferous tubules were altered. The virus was diffusely located within the interstitial tissue 9 h following the injection whereas, after 24 h, viral proteins were restricted to the cytoplasm of infiltrated leukocytes. The number of leukocytes increased with time post-injection. Thus, 24 h post-injection, CD3(+) T-cell number was 3-fold higher, ED1(+) monocyte number was 4-fold higher and polynuclear cell number was 600-fold higher than in the control testes (P < 0.001 all observations). In contrast, the population of resident macrophages was unaffected by Sendai virus. CONCLUSIONS: Testicular viral infection causes inflammation including rapid recruitment of leukocytes. The experiments presented here provide a model for further studies on the etiopathology of viral orchitis, in particular that caused by mumps virus.																					WOS:000184533700005	12871865

Agric.]				25				131	140						1952	1952	The authors studied the biological properties of Teschen disease virus using passaged spinal cord material preserved on dry ice from pigs which had been killed during the paralytic phase. In a number of pigs weighing 10-25 kg. given intracerebrally doses of 0.l-l ml. of a 10-1-10-2 centrifuged cord suspension, the incubation period varied from 6-12 days. The authors failed to set up the disease by intravenous inj. of massive doses of virus. Experimental infection by the intranasal and intra-peritoneal routes was stated to be possible but rare.At the time of appearance of the first symptoms most of the virus was concentrated in the c.n.s., particularly the cord.During later stages the virus content of the c.n.s. decreased rapidly and after the 5th-7th day of the paralytic stage it could.not be demonstrated. Pigs infected by intracerebral inj. did not excrete the virus with their faeces. The size of the virus was established by ultrafiltration as about 25 m.Wild pigs were found to be susceptible to the same extent as domestic ones. Transmission experiments to animals other than pigs failed, although one kitten and two young hamsters developed a form of paralysis following intra-cerebral inj. of virus. Cultivation attempts in chick embryos failed. A 10% virus suspension became inactivated when kept for 20 min. at 60°C. Ether had no effect on the virus. Alkaline pH appeared to increase its virulence.A method of purification was described which consisted of exposure of cord material to papain at a pH of 5.5, followed by extraction of fat and acid precipitation. The resulting purified virus retained about 10% of its original virulence.In respect of its properties Teschen disease virus was stated to resemble the virus of poliomyelitis more closely than those of the arthropod-borne encephalitides.-E.G.

Effect of low environmental temperature upon Japanese B encephalitis virus multiplication in the mosquito								MOSQUITO NEWS				23	(4)			330	335						1963	1963	Japanese B encephalitis virus multiplication in experimentally-infected Culex mosquitoes was inhibited when the mosquitoes were held at 10[degree]C. Virus infection persisted in these mosquitoes, as indicated by the rapid virus multiplication when they were returned to 26.5[degree]C. Low temperature did not appear to adversely affect the virus titer already attained in the mosquitoes prior to exposure to the cold, at least during the observation period reported. It is suggested that low temperature in nature could exert an effect upon JBE virus transmission by inhibiting virus multiplication in the mosquito vector. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. C.

However, the impact of SVI on the interplay between the host immunity and gut microbiota in the context of environmental exposures is not well defined. We utilized the preclinical nonhuman primate (NHP) model consisting of SVI-free (specific-pathogen-free [SPF]) rhesus macaques and compared them to the animals with SVI (non-SPF) acquired through natural exposure and investigated the impact of SVI on immune cell distribution and function, as well as on gut microbiota. These changes were examined in animals housed in the outdoor environment compared to the controlled indoor environment. We report that SVI are associated with altered immune cell subsets and gut microbiota composition in animals housed in the outdoor environment. Non-SPF animals harbored a higher proportion of potential butyrate-producing Firmicutes and higher numbers of lymphocytes, effector T cells, and cytokine-producing T cells. Surprisingly, these differences diminished following their transfer to the controlled indoor environment, suggesting that non-SPFs had increased responsiveness to environmental exposures. An experimental infection of indoor SPF animals with CMV resulted in an increased abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, validating that CMV enhanced colonization of butyrate-producing commensals. Finally, non-SPF animals displayed lower antibody responses to influenza vaccination compared to SPF animals. Our data show that subclinical CMV infection heightens host immunity and gut microbiota changes in response to environmental exposures. This may contribute to the heterogeneity in host immune response to vaccines and environmental stimuli at the population level.IMPORTANCE Humans harbor several latent viruses that modulate host immunity and commensal microbiota, thus introducing heterogeneity in their responses to pathogens, vaccines, and environmental exposures. Most of our understanding of the effect of CMV on the immune system is based on studies of children acquiring CMV or of immuno-compromised humans with acute or reactivated CMV infection or in ageing individuals. The experimental mouse models are genetically inbred and are completely adapted to the indoor laboratory environment. In contrast, nonhuman primates are genetically out-bred and are raised in the outdoor environment. Our study is the first to report the impact of long-term subclinical CMV infection on host immunity and gut microbiota, which is evident only in the outdoor environment but not in the indoor environment. The significance of this study is in highlighting the impact of SVI on enhancing host immune susceptibility to environmental exposures and immune heterogeneity.

The virulence of the strains may be judged by a parameter such as the weight of the animal in 5 or 10 days after inoculation. The highest degree of protection was observed in the animals immunized with strain 15, the least in those immunized with strain 230. The above results indicate that adult white rats may be used as a model for the evaluation of the efficacy of protective preparations against viruses of the VEE complex.

Natural and experimental infections with the virus of eastern encephalitis in wild rodents from Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan and Georgia								ZOONOSES RES				1	(5)			87	96						1961	1961	Antibodies to eastern encephalitis virus (EEV) were found in six out of fifteen species of wild rodents sampled. Fifty-three animals, representing eight species of rodents collected in Wisconsin were found to be susceptible to small quantities of virus inoculated intracerebrally and by routes chosen to simulate exposure to an arthropod vector. The infections were usually inapparent, without demonstrable viremia and usually resulted in prompt develop -ment of high levels of virus neutralizing antibody. Sixteen of 53 wild rodents inoculated with EEV had brain lesions at necropsy about two weeks after inoculation consisting of leukocytic infiltrations, and glial cell swelling and proliferation. These changes were usually accom-panied by mineralization of cells and the walls of small blood vessels. It is concluded that the species of wild rodents studied are fully susceptible to infection with EEV, but that in failing to develop demonstrable levels of viremia, they probably do not constitute important sources of virus for transmission by biting Diptera. The possibility is suggested, however, that rodents may play some part in the long-term survival of EEV through their association with other hosts or vectors of the infection. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19634300007148

Gene transfer into bovine cells and embryos using replication-defective retroviral vectors encapsidated with xenotropic murine leukemia virus envelopes								Animal Biotechnology				4	1			53	69						1993	1993	The amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) env gene has been the most commonly used among the three kinds of MLV in retroviral vector systems due to its wide host range. On bovine target cells, however, we demonstrated that retroviral vectors packaged with xenotropic MLV envelope proteins were more than 500-fold more infectious compared to the same vectors packaged with amphotropic MLV envelope proteins. This result indicates that the xenotropic MLV env gene is potentially more useful than the amphotropic MLV env in experiments designed to transfer genes to cells derived from non-murine species. In a test of internal promoter activity in a retroviral vector, herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (TK), simian virus 40 (SV40), human histone H4 and rat beta-actin promoters worked well in bovine cells. Finally, by co-culture of bovine blastocysts and xenotropic MLV-based virus-producing cells, we infected the embryos with viruses encapsidated with xenotropic MLV envelope proteins. Infection of the embryo was confirmed by detection of the embryonic cells expressing Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase gene under the rat beta-actin promoter which was transferred by retrovirus-mediated infection.

In this report we describe a small-animal model suited to study RSV-induced pathogenesis and immune response. Guinea pigs are infected by inhalation of an RSV-aerosol. Lungs of infected animals show signs of a bronchiolitis at 7 days after the initial infection. Although neutralizing serum antibodies are synthesized viral proteins are still detectable at 6 weeks post infection. Therefore, the presence of neutralizing antibodies is obviously not sufficient for rapid clearance of persistent RSV-proteins from the lungs of infected guinea pigs.

In the spinal cord, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces an AFM-like disease with gray matter inflammation during the acute phase, 1 week post infection (p.i.), and an MS-like disease with white matter inflammation during the chronic phase, 1 month p.i. Although gut microbiota has been proposed to affect immune responses contributing to pathological conditions in remote organs, including the brain pathophysiology, its precise role in neuroinflammatory diseases is unclear. We infected SJL/J mice with TMEV; harvested feces and spinal cords on days 4 (before onset), 7 (acute phase), and 35 (chronic phase) p.i.; and examined fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing and CNS transcriptome by RNA sequencing. Although TMEV infection neither decreased microbial diversity nor changed overall microbiome patterns, it increased abundance of individual bacterial generaMarvinbryantiaon days 7 and 35 p.i. andCoprococcuson day 35 p.i., whose pattern-matching with CNS transcriptome showed strong correlations:Marvinbryantiawith eight T-cell receptor (TCR) genes on day 7 and with seven immunoglobulin (Ig) genes on day 35 p.i.; andCoprococcuswith gene expressions of not only TCRs and IgG/IgA, but also major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and complements. The high gene expression of IgA, a component of mucosal immunity, in the CNS was unexpected. However, we observed substantial IgA positive cells and deposition in the CNS, as well as a strong correlation between CNS IgA gene expression and serum anti-TMEV IgA titers. Here, changes in a small number of distinct gut bacteria, but not overall gut microbiota, could affect acute and chronic immune responses, causing AFM- and MS-like lesions in the CNS. Alternatively, activated immune responses would alter the composition of gut microbiota.																					WOS:000553373300001	32733435

CD8 + T cells are a major part of the immune response to MCMV and HCMV. Processing of peptides for presentation to CD8+ T cells may be critically dependent on the immunoproteasome, expression of which is affected by MCMV. However, the overall importance of the immunoproteasome in the generation of immunodominant peptides from MCMV is not known. We therefore examined the role of the immunoproteasome in stimulation of CD8+ T cell responses to MCMV - both conventional memory responses and those undergoing long-term expansion or inflation.

Type O virus diluted 1: 250 was rubbed into the scarified tongue and gums of five lambs aged 2-20.5 months, and five others were infected by contact. Laboratory investigation of blood serum 15 days after infection revealed the presence of antibodies which protected baby mice against infection. The c.f. test was negative in all the lambs but the slow c.f. test with O type antigen was positive to a low titre. No precipitating antibodies were demonstrated. There was an increase of the albumin fraction and quantitative changes in some amino-acids. The activity of aspartate-aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase increased rapidly.Post-infection immunity resulting from field disease and from experimental infection was compared with that induced by vaccination. The latter group of sheep was subdivided into 5, each receiving different doses of type O and/or type A aluminium-hydroxide lapinized formol vaccine. Animals with post-infection immunity were resistant to challenge after 6 and 12 months. Protecting and neutralizing antibodies in vaccinated animals reached the peak titres after 10-20 days but dropped after 120-150 days as compared with 18 months' duration in sheep with naturally acquired immunity.

Research over the past 100 years has established that the aetiological agent, Borna disease virus (BDV), is an unsegmented, single- and negative-stranded, enveloped ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus which represents the family Bornaviridae in the order Mononegavirales. The virus exists world-wide in horses, sheep, cattle, cats, dogs and ostriches. The infection can be fatal, but the majority of carriers are persistently infected without showing symptoms. The association with psychiatric diseases in humans led to an international explosion of research on BDV, with centres established in Germany, the United States of America and Japan. Experimental infections of tree shrews and rats served to examine the effects of persistent and overt disease, most excitingly, virus-induced behavioural changes, and emotional and learning deficits. This 'emerging' virus infection shows complex pathogenetic mechanisms in the nervous system, but also spreads through myelo-monocytic cells. Diagnosis can be made serologically, but defection of antigen markers in peripheral white blood cells, combined with nucleic acid amplification is more profitable. Comparative RNA studies reveal an unusually high genetic homology of viruses. Isolates recovered from humans and equines suggest species-specificity. Vaccination is not an advisable strategy, but antiviral therapy, especially with amantadine sulphate, promises efficacy in human mood disorders, and is effective in vitro. Infections with BDV follow a vulnerability principle to cause disease. Although cross-species transmission of this commensal virus has not been proven, zoonotic aspects of BDV should be carefully considered.																					WOS:000086242500021	11189720

We previously found that PD-L1 expression was upregulated in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and that an antibody that blocked the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction reactivated T-cell function in vitro. Therefore, this study assessed its antivirus activities in vivo. First, we inoculated the anti-bovine PD-L1 rat monoclonal antibody 4G12 into a BLV-infected cow. However, this did not induce T-cell proliferation or reduction of BLV provirus loads during the test period, and only bound to circulating IgM(+) B cells until one week post-inoculation. We hypothesized that this lack of in vivo effects was due to its lower stability in cattle and so established an anti-PD-L1 rat-bovine chimeric antibody (Boch4G12). Boch4G12 was able to bind specifically with bovine PD-L1, interrupt the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction, and activate the immune response in both healthy and BLV-infected cattle in vitro. Therefore, we experimentally infected a healthy calf with BLV and inoculated it intravenously with 1 mg/kg of Boch4G12 once it reached the aleukemic (AL) stage. Cultivation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from the tested calf indicated that the proliferation of CD4(+) T cells was increased by Boch4G12 inoculation, while BLV provirus loads were significantly reduced, clearly demonstrating that this treatment induced antivirus activities. Therefore, further studies using a large number of animals are required to support its efficacy for clinical application.																					WOS:000400309200014	28445479

Some studies have demonstrated that oxidative stress, as well as the adenosinergic system, exert an important role in the pathogenesis of viral diseases. Oxidative stress is considered a disturbance in the antioxidant/oxidant status in favor of the excessive generation or lower removal of free radicals. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether changes on the adenosinergic system and oxidative stress occurred in cats positives for feline leukemia virus (FeLV). Materials,Methods & Results: Forty-nine serum samples of cats (between 4 months and 13 years of age) seen at the Veterinary Hospital of the University of Santa Catarina State (UDESC - Lages, SC, Brazil) were used. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein and stored in tubes without anticoagulant to obtain serum. An aliquot was used to detect both viral infections using the kit SNAP FIV/FeLV, that detects the p27 protein from FeLV and antibodies against the p24 protein from FIV. The test was performed according the manufacture's recommendations. Based on this result, this study involved 20 FeLV negative cats, 20 FeLV positive symptomatic cats, and 9 FeLV positives asymptomatic cats. Serum samples were used to determine the activities of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), as well as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen levels (ROS). Seric ADA and GST activities, as well as TBARS (lipid peroxidation) and ROS (free radical) levels were determined spectrophotometrically according to the specific method. Seric ADA activity was increased in symptomatic animals compared to negatives and also to asymptomatic positive animals, and the same was observed for seric TBARS levels. On the other hand, GST activity decreased in the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups compared to the negative control group. No difference was observed regarding seric ROS levels.Discussion: The upregulation of seric ADA activity observed in this present study could contribute to the inflammatory process since it would decrease seric levels of Ado, a nucleoside with anti-inflammatory effects. Lipids, especially the polyunsaturated fatty acids, are sensitive to oxidation by free radicals, generating MDA, and cause to increase of TBARS levels. A significant negative correlation between lipid peroxidation and ADA activity in kidney samples of rats experimentally infected by protozoan, and these authors demonstrated that increase on lipid peroxidation is linked to decreased ADA activity. The reduction on seric GST activity can be explained since the antioxidant enzyme was unable to remove the excess of peroxides and superoxide anion, resulting on decreased cellular antioxidant activity. Based on these evidences, it is possible to conclude that symptomatic FeLV cats showed an upregulation on seric ADA activity associated to the impairment of the immune response, contributing to inflammatory processes. Moreover, FeLV symptomatic cats showed damage to lipids and an impairment on antioxidant/oxidant status, alterations compatible to oxidative stress and oxidative damage. In summary, these alterations contribute to the pathophysiology of FeLV infection, and can be used as markers of this disease.																					WOS:000413286000001		
J	Stitz, L								[Immune intervention in Borna disease].				Immunintervention bei der Borna-Krankheit.				Tierarztliche Praxis				19	5			509	14						1991-Oct	1991	Borna disease is a naturally occurring meningoencephalomyelitis of sheep and horses. After experimental infection of rats with Borna disease virus a biphasic disease with initial gait disturbances and later paresis and paralysis can be observed. The disease symptoms in these experimental animals resemble those of the natural hosts. The disease is not caused by the infecting virus itself but rather by a CD4+ T cell-mediated immune response. After the pathogenesis had been elucidated new strategies for the therapy of Borna disease by interfering with the immune reaction have been developed. Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, with monoclonal antibodies directed against certain immune cells and with mediators of the immune reaction resulted in an inhibition or significant reduction of Borna disease symptoms.

R			BioCI						HIV Nef Mediated Transcription in Primary CD4+ T cells								European Nucleotide Archive															2019-06-11	2019	Our study investigates the role of the Nef protein on cellular gene transcription in infected primary CD4+ T cells with the goal of understanding how HIV Nef promotes viral replication and subsequent cellular pathology. To assess the effect of Nef on gene expression, RNA sequencing was done on 6 samples. In 3 control samples, we infected primary human CD4+ T cells with the wild-type HIV genome (NL4-3 Vpr mCD24 I-Env Wt-Nef). In the 3 experimental samples, we infected additional cells with a Nef-deleted variant of HIV (NL4-3 Vpr mCD24 I-Env I-Nef). The NL4-3 genome was introduced into the CD4+ T-cells through a pseudovirus infection. After 24 hours of infection, cells containing the HIV genome were then enriched through positive selection using anti-mCD24 microbeads. The mRNA was isolated using Trizol and subsequently reverse transcribed into complementary DNA. This cDNA seqments for each sample were sequence using High Throughput DNA Sequencing. Cells: 293 T cells were used to make pseudovirus containing vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G (VSV-G) and primary CD4 T cells were used for one round virus infection. Viruses: NL4-3 Vpr mCD24 I-Env Wt-Nef and NL4-3 Vpr mCD24 I-Env I-Nef. Note that both viruses express mouse CD24 or heat stable antigen (HSAg) in place of Vpr as well as are unable to express envelope (Env) due to deletion in envelope gene. However, the former one expresses functional Nef (wt Nef) and the latter one does not (I-Nef) Pseudovirus production: Pseudovirus was produced by co-transfection of 293T cells (5 x 106 293T cells that had been seeded in a T75 tissue culture flask 24 hours previously) with a pNL4-3Vpr-CD24IEnvWt-Nef or a pNL4-3Vpr-CD24IEnvI-Nef plasmid (15Ag) and the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope glycoprotein G expression vector pHCMVG (5Ag) using BioT transfection reagent following the the manufactureras protocol (Bioland, Paramount, CA). Supernatants were obtained 24 and 48 hours after transfection, passed through a 0.45Am filter, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation (26,000 rpm for 90 minutes at 4EsC, SW28 rotor, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Aliquots containing approximately 50 ng HIV-1 p24 antigen in 50 Al were frozen at -80EsC until use. Concentration of antigen in the aliquots were measured by p24 ELISA kit (XpressBio, Frederick, MD). CD4 T cells preparation: PBMCs from a healthy donor were prepared by by Ficoll separation and cultured in the presence of bispecific monoclonal antibody CD3:CD8 (NIH Reagent program #12277). Briefly, PBMCs were resuspended at a concentration of 1.5X106 cells/ml in R10-50 and 1 ml of cell suspension transferred into each well of 24-well plate. After adding, bispecific antibody (final concentration 0.5 Ag/ml), cell were cultured for 6 days at 37 0C incubator in the presence of 5% CO2. Cells were about 97% CD4 T cell positive when analyzed by flow cytometer on day 6 using anti-CD4 antibody (Biolegend, San Diego, CA; Cat#301408Total RNA Isolation from the magnetic beads separated cells: Separated cells were washed two times with PBS and then used for total RNA isolation using Trizol kit following the protocol of supplier (ThermoFisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY).

It was demonstrated that administration of tymosin-alpha1 in cultivated in vitro cellular system had been inoculated with HSV provided inhibition of HSV reproduction and defense of cells of HSV cytopathogenic action. Moreover Ta1 ability to inhibit HSV reproduction in cell was comparable with the same ability of human alpha-interferon.

The animals were killed and homogenates were prepared of their brains, which were used for testing the infective titre in vivo and for the isolation of nuclei, by means of the Hymer-Kuff technique. For the cytokaryological examinations, smears were prepared from the homogenate, which were stained by May-Grunwald-Giemsa and Mann methods. The cell and nucleus types were evaluated morphologically, descriptively, according to the size and structure. On the basis of three criteria the following groups were set up: large sized cells with bulky nuclei; middle sized cells with nuclei of a medium size; small sized cells with small nuclei and visible nucleoli; small sized cells with small, tachychromatic nuclei; cells exhibiting karyolysis. In both the infection with herpes virus simplex type 1 and type 2, the small sized cells with small tachychromatic nuclei represent the highest rate. Between the variants of the elaborated models no significant differences regarding the cell and nucleus types are recorded. On the whole, the cytokaryological picture does not exhibit notable differences, but rather resemblances with respect to the proportionality of the nucleus types in the experimental variants studied, in the case of herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 induced infections.

To compare the relative effects of surfactant and PFC liquid, we infected orotracheally intubated Sprague-Dawley rats with 4 X 10(9) pfu of an E1a(-)/E3(-) adenovirus expressing either an Escherichia coli lacZ (AdiacZ) mini-gene or no cDNA (Adnuil). Surfactant-mediated delivery was achieved via instillation of four, 200-mul aliquots of virus suspended in a 50% surfactant (Survanta) vehicle over a 15-minute period. PFC rats received virus in 100 mul of saline followed by instillation of the PFC liquid FC-75 (10 cc/kg body weight) over a 2- to 3- minute period. Lungs were collected 3 days later for measurement of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) expression and indices of inflammation. Both PFC liquid and surfactant-based vehicles produced widespread p-gal expression and increased total p-gal activity over that observed with instillation of vector alone. Both vehicles comparably increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), total cell counts, neutrophils, total protein, and IFNgamma. FC-75 was also associated with increased BALF IL1beta. In conclusion, surfactant and FC-75 are similarly effective vehicles for adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to the lung.																					WOS:000176578500008	12095302

Molecular imaging				2	4			342	9		10.1162/153535003322750682				2003-Oct	2003	Positron emission tomographic imaging is emerging as a powerful technology to monitor reporter transgene expression in the lungs and other organs. However, little information is available about its usefulness for studying gene expression over time. Therefore, we infected 20 rats with a replication-deficient adenovirus containing a fusion gene encoding for a mutant Herpes simplex virus type-1 thymidine kinase and an enhanced green fluorescent protein. Five additional rats were infected with a control virus. Pulmonary gene transfer was performed via intratracheal administration of vector using a surfactant-based method. Imaging was performed 4-6 hr, and 4, 7, and 10 days after gene transfer, using 9-(4-[18F]-fluoro-3-hydroxymethylbutyl)guanine, an imaging substrate for the mutant kinase. Lung tracer uptake assessed with imaging was moderately but significantly increased 4-6 hr after gene transfer, was maximal after 4 days, and was no longer detectable by 10 days. The temporal pattern of transgene expression measured ex vivo with in vitro assays of thymidine kinase activity and green fluorescent protein was similar to imaging. In conclusion, positron emission tomography is a reliable new tool to evaluate the onset and duration of reporter gene expression noninvasively in the lungs of intact animals.

The occurrence and identification of blue-tongue in cattle[long dash]the so-called pseudo-foot and mouth disease in South Africa								ONDERSTEPOORT JOUR VET SCI AND ANIMAL INDUST				2	(2)			393	507						1934	1934	During the fall of 1933 an undescribed disease, referred to as pseudo-foot-and-mouth disease, affected cattle in various herds over an extensive area. Although apparently not new, in 1933 it received more attention, since veterinarians had difficulty in positively excluding foot-and-mouth disease. Study showed that the virus causing blue-tongue in sheep occurred in the blood of most of the cattle with this disease. In experimentally infected sheep, characteristic reactions of blue-tongue developed, and the specificity of the virus was established by immunological tests. Calves, although less susceptible than sheep, underwent a definite reaction when infected with virus originally from cattle. Economically blue-tongue in cattle is of minor significance, since only a small % of animals are affected and most of these recover; but from a differential diagnostic viewpoint, in connection with foot-and-mouth disease, it is highly important. Knowledge that cattle are susceptible to the blue-tongue virus may throw further light on certain cattle diseases of S. Africa, in which the etiology is still somewhat obscure, such as sweating sickness of calves, the alleged occurrence of malignant catarrhal fever, and the so-called three-day-stiff-sickness. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: T.

Some virological and pathomorphological aspects of the respiratory system in the experimental infection with respiratory syncytial virus associated with influenza virus, parainfluenza virus type 3 and adenovirus in the mouse								Romanian Journal of Virology				47	1-4			61	73						Jan.-Dec., 1996	1996	Infections with respiratory syncytial virus Long strain, associated with influenza virus, A/Beijing 353/89 (H3N2) strain, parainfluenza virus type 3, 739-2D strain, and adenovirus type 3, were experimentally induced in white mice, causing histological, histochemical and histoenzymatic lesions at the respiratory system level, the severity of which exceeded the one observed in the controls infected with a single virus. The pathomorphological changes made up an inflammatory, predominantly infiltrative, lymphohistiocytic, then exudative and alterative picture. The severest and most frequent lesion was the diffuse interstitial, often peribronchiolovascular, bronchopneumonia, which might involve large parenchyma areas. Another highly frequent pulmonary lesion was the thickening of interalveolar septa, due to stasis hyperemia, oedema and the predominantly lymphocytic cytoinfiltrate. At the level of the extrapulmonary airways, the lesion present in all experimental models was the denudation of epithelium cilia. In the viral association in which influenza virus was included, an alteration, the hyalinosis of tunica media of the vessels, as well as of the Reisseisen's muscle, was also observed, in addition to the cytoinfiltrate; when the association was achieved with parainfluenza virus type 3, many macrophages and erythrocytes and a few fibroblasts appeared in the cytoinfiltrate, the alteration being the same as in the former model; when the association contained adenovirus, there appeared necrosis, abundant lymphocytes and lysis of the Reisseisen's muscle in the bronchopulmonary block. The associated infections were demonstrated by the presence of homologous serum antibodies and by positive IF reactions in the pulmonary tissue.																					BCI:BCI199800405951	9495783

West Nile Virus Associations in Wild Mammals: An Update								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	5					459	10.3390/v11050459				MAY 2019	2019	Although West Nile virus (WNV) is generally thought to circulate among mosquitoes and birds, several historic and recent works providing evidence of WNV activity in wild mammals have been published. Indeed, a previous review tabulated evidence of WNV exposure in at least 100 mammalian species. Herein, we provide an update on WNV activity in wild and select other mammals that have been reported since the last major review article on this subject was published in early 2013. Of interest, new species, such as Hoffman's two-toed sloths (Choloepus hoffmanni), are now included in the growing list of wild mammals that have been naturally exposed to WNV. Furthermore, new instances of WNV viremia as well as severe disease presumably caused by this virus have been reported in wild mammals (e.g., the Virginia opossum [Didelphis virginiana]) from natural and semi-captive (e.g., zoological institution) settings. Regrettably, few recent challenge studies have been conducted on wild mammals, which would provide key information as to their potential role(s) in WNV cycles. Largely based on these recent findings, important future lines of research are recommended to assess which mammalian species are commonly exposed to WNV, which mammal species develop viremias sufficient for infecting mosquitoes, and which mammal species might be negatively affected by WNV infection at the species or population level.

Medical Journal of Australia								887	891						1939, Dec. 16th	1939	The two recently discovered rickettsial diseases, " Q " fever of Queensland and a tick-borne fever of Montana, have been shown to be closely related. As these diseases appear to be indigenous to widely separated localities, the authors considered it of interest to compare them carefully. It was found that there was complete cross-immunity and cross-agglutination. The Montana strain, however, was more pathogenic for g. pigs, mice and two species of monkey. Also it was more readily propagated on the chorio-allantoic membrane where it produced well marked focal lesions, this being unusual for rickettsiae. The authors conclude that both strains should be included in one species.-W. I. B. BEVERIDGE.																					CABI:19402202125

Levels of IFN-gamma in the MLT-treated group were significantly increased (P < 0.001) when compared with the control non-infected group from day I to 6 post-infection (p.i.), while in infected mice treated with 500 mug MLT/kg of bodyweight enhanced levels of IFN-gamma were evident from 4 to 6 days p.i. No differences were detected in the levels of IL-2 between the controls, the infected mice treated with MLT and the infected untreated group, from day 2 p.i. No changes in serum levels of IL-4 were detected. In infected mice treated with MLT, blood levels of IL-1beta were elevated almost 10-fold from day 1 to day 6 p.i. when compared to the control, the infected and the non-infected MLT-treated mice (P < 0.001). A highly significant rise (P < 0.001) of TNF-alpha was found in infected mice treated with MLT, from day I to 6 p.i. when compared to the other groups. A significant rise (P < 0.001) was also evident in the infected non-MLT-treated group and a less pronounced rise in the non-infected mice treated with MLT when compared to controls. The blockade of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha did not inhibit the protective effect of MLT but when IL-1beta was neutralized, 100% of the infected mice died suggesting that IL-1beta induced by MLT treatment is a target cytokine to generate an immune response against the viral infection.

J	GORDON, W. S.; GORDON, I. W. S.; BROWNLEE, A.; WILSON, D. R.; MacLEOD, J.; MacLEOD, J.; GORDON, W. S.; Et al.								Studies in louping-ill. (An encephalomyelitis of sheep.) A: A note on the infectivity of blood. B: A field experiment (1931), with a preliminary note on the nature of tick-borne fever. II. Transmission by the sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus L								JOUR COMP PATH AND THERAP				45	(2)-(3)			106	140, 240-256						1932	1932	Louping-ill, characterized by cerebellar ataxia and disorder of brain function, is due to a distince filter-passing virus with neurotropic characters. Circumstantial evidence favors the view that Ixodes ricinus plays an important part in its transmission. Mice are susceptible to infection by intra-cerebral inoculation with virus-containing tissue. After experimental infection of sheep, blood was tested daily by intracerebral inoculation of mice to determine at what period after infection virus could be recovered from the blood, and incidentally when ticks could be infected by feeding on diseased animals. The virus invaded the blood concurrently with initial rise in temp., and was present in demonstrable amount throughout the febrile stage. In most instances, fall in temp. was followed by disappearance of much or all virus from the blood. In a field exp. 48 sheep were rendered immune to louping-ill and 49 susceptible sheep (controls) were grazed on a pasture where ticks abounded, and where the disease was known to occur. All the sheep became infested with ticks, and in every sheep (immune or control) of which a temp. record was kept, a febrile reaction developed. The reaction in immune sheep was attributed to a hitherto undescribed disease caused by an infective agent transmitted by ticks, and the condition has been named "tick-borne fever." The reaction in the controls was attributed in a large proportion of cases to louping-ill in addition to tick-borne fever. In support of this conclusion there are the following facts: A greater loss of weight occurred in controls, and their febrile reaction had a shorter incubation period. Of the survivors, 60.9% were immune to louping-ill; all were immune to ticke-borne fever. Ticks collected from a control which died during the exp. from a braxy-like disease were shown to harbor the virus of louping-ill. On many tick-infested farms, tick-borne fever probably occurs in individual sheep concurrently with louping-ill, and this the authors believe may account for some of the difficulties of previous investigators in establishing the etiology of the latter. Clinical manifestations of typical louping-ill are due to infection of the central nervous system with this virus, but virus may be detected in the blood in cases in which symptoms of louping-ill do not subsequently develop; in such cases the symptom of infection is a febrile reaction occasionally followed by death. This suggests that for the occurrence of typical louping-ill, invasion of the central nervous system by the virus is essential. It appears that accessory conditions favor such invasion, e.g., the occurrence of tick-borne fever. Recovery from infection results in immunity, but the evidence so far indicates that use of a living virus for prophylactic purposes is not a safe procedure.[long dash]II. Ticks which had fed on affected sheep were pulped and emulsified in saline. These emulsions induced louping-ill when inoculated intracerebrally into mice and sheep. The disease was transmitted to sheep by the bites of female and nymphal ticks which had, respectively, acquired virus as nymphs and larvae. Criteria used to determine infection with louping-ill were: development in sheep of a febrile reaction that might or might not be followed by symptoms of nervous disturbance and by death; production of symptoms of louping-ill followed by death in mice inoculated intracerebrally with blood of reacting sheep taken at the peak of the thermal reaction; and immunity of sheep that had recovered, when inoculated intracerebrally with the virus. Louping-ill was produced in 9 cases in which sheep were infested with infected ticks; 6 of these cases were infected with tick-borne fever, either before or at time of exposure to louping-ill. Results suggest that for production of the typical clinical disease a combination of the 2 infections is necessary. It was shown, however, that sheep can become infected with, and die from, louping-ill transmitted by ticks in absence of tick-borne fever. Ticks were capable of producing louping-ill within 12 days after molting, and, as they require about 8-9 days to harden before attaching themselves, it appears that they are infective as soon as they are capable of becoming attached to host sheep. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W.

J	Chu, Rea-Min; Yang, Ping-Cheng; Cheng, Ivan Chen								Review: Foot-and-mouth disease								Journal of the Chinese Society of Veterinary Science				23	6			477	491						Dec., 1997	1997	Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an internationally important contagious disease infected cloven-hoofed animals. The causative agent is an aphthovirus belonging to Picornaviridae. It is a minute virus with a size about 22nm, the betaG-betaH loop in the structural protein VP1 is an antigenic decisive site. By cross protection and serological tests, seven serotypes are designated, they are O, A, C, SAT-1, SAT-2, SAT-3 and Asia 1, with over 80 subtypes. Cross protection between serotypes is minimal; however, variable protection is present between subtypes among the same serotype. The mutation frequency(MF) of FMD virus is tremendous, the MF of the ID gene in SAT-2 virus in cattle is 1.64 X 10-2 replacement/nucleotide/year, in comparison to a normal cell DNA, the MF is only 10-9. Virus isolation is so far the most reliable method to definitively diagnose the disease. In differentiating serotypes, ELISA, CF, liquid-phase blocking ELISA are usually employed. Clinically and pathologically, FMD infection is difficult to differentiate from infection of other vesicular diseases, such as swine vesicular disease, vesicular stomatitis and vesicular exanthema, virus isolation and associated antigens detection are also the only officially acceptable methods for a confirmative diagnosis of these diseases. The viruses first adhere on the target cells through RDG or other mechanism after infecting animals by ways of respiratory tract or skin, they then enter the cells via endocytosis and multiply intracellularly. The viruses are replicated in tissues adjacent to pharyngeal region and in tonsil, thereafter, they are transported to other-parts of body by Langerhan's cells through blood or other vehicles, but mainly to the cytoplasm of epithelial cells, they may also infect myocardiocytes causing cell necrosis. Vesicles are developed as factors such as pressure, trauma or other unknown reasons are applied to the skin; otherwise, the viruses are slowly disintegrated. They naturally infect cattle, pig, goat, sheep, deer, camel and many wild cloven-hoofed animals, rabbits and mice are experimentally infected. Horizontal transmission through direct contact is the major way of transmission; however, air is another significant media for the spread of the viruses. High titre of viruses (108-1010 TCID50/day) are present in vesicular fluid, saliva, milk, semen, breath and manure of infected animals. Human beings are a consequential mechanical means of transporting the virus. The only known reservoir animals for the viruses are ruminants, the viruses will not be detected in pigs in 14-28 days after recovery. The carrier animals shed viruses intermittently with diminishing amount, the carrier period for cattle is about 1-3 years, water buffalo for 22 months, sheep for 9 months and goat for 4 months. Normally there are two eradication strategies, stamping out and vaccination. Stamping out policy is usually chosen for areas with minimal number of outbreaks, and where routinely practices securely reporting program and tight surveillance system, otherwise, the vaccination policy is constantly executed. The FMD outbreak in Taiwan had been nine months since this past March; nevertheless, new cases recurred six months after the first outbreak in spite of stringent action implemented countrywide all the way along the whole period. It is therefore our duty to put forth unequivocally special precaution while operating the control and eradication programs for FMD virus infection.																					BCI:BCI199800258517

A protozoan parasite of the central nervous system								INDIAN JOUR MED RES				32	(2)			207	222						1944	1944	A parasite, apparently protozoal in character, originally found in the midbrains of guinea-pigs experimentally infected with rabies "street" virus is descr. and an account given of its occurrence in other animals. Appearances, similar to the various stages in the life cycle of the parasite, have been observed in the midbrain of dogs, jackals, a calf and a cat suffering from natural rabies infections, and in the brains of experimental animals infected from them. Certain stages in the life cycle of the parasite appear to be filterable, and it has been possible to reproduce the parasite in experimental animals by the inoculation of brain suspensions passed through Berkefeld V and N candles. The parasite appears to be specific to the central nervous system, and, in spite of exhaustive searches, has not been found in other organs and tissues. It has never been observed except in association with natural or exptl. rabies infection, and the possibility of the protozoan parasite being connected with the etiology of rabies is discussed. The relationship of the parasite to Negri bodies has been investigated and the suggestion put forward that Negri bodies may represent a stage in the life cycle of the parasite. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: N.

Genes & cancer				1	10			1008	20		10.1177/1947601910395580				2010-Oct	2010	SV40 has been detected prevalently in a limited panel of human tumors: mesothelioma, bone and brain tumors, and lymphoma. These are the same tumor types that are specifically induced by SV40 when injected into hamsters, a finding that has raised concerns about the possible pathogenic role of SV40 in humans. Two different SV40 isolates differing in the number of 72-bp elements in the virus regulatory region, archetypal SV40 (1ESV40), which contains one 72 bp, and nonarchetypal SV40 (wtSV40), which contains two 72 bp, have been detected in human tumors. 1ESV40 has been prevalently detected in brain tumors, with wtSV40 prevalently in mesothelioma. The apparent different cell tropism could be related to the virus (i.e., possibly to the number of 72-bp elements) and to different expression of cellular genes, known to play a critical role in SV40-mediated transformation of human cells, such as Notch-1 and c-Met. To test for possible differences in tissue tropism, we infected primary human mesothelial cells (HM) and primary human astrocytes (Ast) with 1ESV40 and with wtSV40 from 2 different SV40 strains, 776 and Baylor. All viruses transformed astrocytes; only wtSV40 transformed HM. Intracellular signaling of c-Met and Notch-1 was differently induced by these 2 viruses in HM and Ast. Differences in Notch-1 expression and signaling (i.e., downstream effectors, c-Myc, HEY-1, HES-1, and HEY-L) appeared to influence SV40-mediated transformation of primary astrocytes and mesothelial cells. Our results provide a biological rationale to the observation that 1ESV40 is prevalently detected in brain tumors and wtSV40 in mesotheliomas.																					MEDLINE:21779427	21779427	
R			Kindai University Faculty of Medicine						Distinct association of microbiota with CNS immune gene expressions between virus-induced acute myelitis versus chronic inflammatory demyelination								European Nucleotide Archive															2020-09-08	2020	Virus infections have been associated with acute and chronic inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases, e.g., acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) and multiple sclerosis (MS), where animal models support the pathogenic roles of viruses. In the spinal cord, Theileras murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces an AFM-like disease with gray matter inflammation during the acute phase 1-week post infection (p.i.) and an MS-like disease with white matter inflammation during the chronic phase 1-month p.i. Gut microbiota can affect immune responses contributing to pathology in remote organs including the CNS. Although gut microbiota have been proposed to play a role in MS pathophysiology, its role in AFM is unclear. We infected SJL/J mice with TMEV, harvested feces and spinal cords on days 4 (before onset), 7 (acute phase), and 35 (chronic phase) p.i., and examined fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing and CNS transcriptome by RNA sequencing. TMEV infection induced neither decreased microbial diversity nor changed overall microbiome patterns, unlike previous findings in other microbiota-associated diseases. We found significantly increased abundance of the genera Marvinbryantia on days 7 and 35, and Coprococcus on day 35, whose pattern matching with CNS transcriptome showed strong correlations: Marvinbryantia with eight T cell receptor (TCR) genes on day 7, and with 10 immunoglobulin (Ig) genes including Ighd4-1 on day 35; and Coprococcus with gene expressions of several major histocompatibility complex (MHC), complements as well as TCR and Ig. Metagenomic analysis predicted the changes in arachidonic acid and ether lipid metabolism due to the changes in five taxa and two taxa of bacteria belong to the order Clostridiales, respectively. Therefore, acute and chronic CNS inflammation could be influenced by the changes in a limited number of distinct bacteria, but not in overall gut microbiota.

According to the structural characterization achieved so far, BDV contains a non-segmented negative-sense 8.9 kb single-stranded RNA genome, In this paper we report the expression, purification and intracellular tracing of a novel non-glycosylated BDV-specific protein with a molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa (BDV p10 protein), The successful isolation of the corresponding mRNA from infected cells, amplification of the genetic region by RT-PCR and its efficient expression as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein demonstrated that antibodies specific for the BDV p10 protein are induced in infected animals. In addition, we have produced monospecific antisera against the GST-p10 fusion protein in rabbits. This monospecific antiserum recognized the BDV p10 protein in brain cells of naturally and experimentally infected animals as well as in persistently BDV-infected cells. Antibody-mediated affinity-chromatography using the anti-p10 serum could successfully be applied to purify a ca. 10 kDa antigen from infected animal cells to such an extent that glycosylation of this component could be ruled out.

The first group (I) was fed milk of intact cows, the second (II) - milk of BLV-infected cows, and the third (III) - milk of cows, clinically BLV sick. Rats of all groups were divided into two subgroups: In the subgroup "a", there were adult rats, and in the subgroup "b", their offspring were included. At 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the start of the experiment, the animals' blood of each group was examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the presence of BLV provirus and specific anti-leukemia antibodies. A general and biochemical blood test was performed; pathological changes in the internal organs were recorded.Results: Using the PCR, the BLV infection was established in all experimental rats, whose immune response was expressed in varying degrees. At the initial stage of the infection, offspring rats were born healthy. The rats of the control groups Ia and Ib were intact to the BLV throughout the experiment. The biochemical blood tests have shown several signs of intoxication, endocrine disorders, and development of malignant processes in the experimental animals. There are also signs of liver, kidney, and myocardial damages, regardless of whether milk is infected or the cows are clinically leukemic. By the time, the experimental rats developed persistent thrombocytosis with an increase in the average volume of the blood platelets, which may be evidence of the leukemia infection by the megakaryocytic type. The most pronounced character of the change was in the offspring generation.Conclusion: Wistar rats can be considered as a suitable laboratory model to study the BLV pathogenesis. Rats are not BLV natural host, however, they developed the pathognomonic BLV infection symptoms when they were fed infected and leukemic cow's milk.																					WOS:000462905800006	31089307

Magyar Allatorvosok Lapja				31	10			625	628						1976	1976	An adenovirus strain isolated from lambs aged 6-8 weeks with a respiratory disease was designated Het/3. Supernatant from virus-infected lamb kidney tissue cultures agglutinated rat erythrocytes in 1:16 dilution at + 4 deg C. In the complement fixation and agar gel diffusion tests a soluble antigen common with that of the bovine adenovirus subgroup I was found. No relationship was found in the serum neutralization (SN) test between the new isolate and the five ovine adenovirus serotypes, bovine adenovirus serotypes 1 and 3. A close relationship, however, was found between the isolate and the bovine adenovirus serotype 1 and 2. Colostrum-deprived lambs were infected with Het/3 strain, and after an incubation period of 3 days respiratory and enteric symptoms developed. At P.M. examination catarrhal inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, bronchopneumonia and enteritis was seen. Histologically bronchopneumonia and enteritis was found. The infected lambs shed the virus in its secretions. Het/3 strain was reisolated from the organs of the upper respiratory tract. Spreading of the infection occurred in the contact lambs. Reconvalescent serum from the naturally and experimentally infected animals neutralized the Het/3 strain and the type 2 of bovine adenovirus to the same titre value in the SN test. This was taken as further evidence of the close relationship between the two strains. [See also VB 45, abst 2417, 3122 and VB 46, abst 1496, 5654].																					CABI:19762279848

DHEA enhances immune responses against a wide range of viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens. In the present study, we investigated the effects of DHEA treatment during the acute phase of experimental Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Male and female Wistar rats were infected with the Y strain of T cruzi and treated subcutaneously with 40mg/kg body weight/day of DHEA. Myocardial parasitism and inflammation were always present in the heart during the acute phase, in male and female infected animals, regardless of DHEA treatment, but the numbers of amastigote nests in cardiomyocytes were significantly lower in DHEA-treated rats. At the end of the acute phase, the nests became rare or virtually absent in all experimental infections. Histological analysis of the adrenal glands showed that treated males displayed an absence of parasites. DHEA treatment also resulted in reduced parasitisim of heart and adrenal glands, as indicated by fewer and smaller amastigote burdens, and less inflammatory infiltrate and tissue disorganization. DHEA treatment also resulted in thymic atrophy as measured both by reduced weight and by a reduction in the number of cultured activated thymocytes. In vitro analysis showed the number of activated macrophages was higher in treated animals. Antibody levels were monitored by complement-mediated lysis. Higher titers were observed in females when compared to males; but DHEA treatment enhanced the percentage of lysis for both sexes. These findings suggest that DHEA can play a role in the control of parasite multiplication. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000248771400001	17560841

Desarrollo de un poxvirus recombinante que expresa la glicoproteina D del herpesvirus bovino-1.				Acta Biologica Colombiana				17	3			511	524						2012	2012	Bovine Herpesvirus-1 is a DNA virus belonging to the family Herpesviridae, which affects cattle, causing a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations and economic losses. The main immunogenic component is its envelope glycoprotein D (gD), which has been characterized and used as immunogen in different expression systems. The aim of this work was to generate a recombinant poxvirus (Raccoonpox [RCN]) expressing a truncated version of BHV-1 gD to be used as a vaccine. To do this, it was amplified the gene for a truncated version of gD which subsequently was cloned in transfer plasmid PTK/IRES/tpa which has homology to sites of poxvirus thymidine kinase, an internal site of ribosome entry (IRES) and a secretory signal (tPA), generating the construct PTK/gD/IRES/tpa. To generate the recombinant RCN, we took BSC-1 cells and we infected with a wild type RCN (CDC/V71-I-85A) at a multiplicity of infection of 0.05, then cells were transfected with the construct PTK/gD/IRES/tpa, generating different viral populations with and without the gene of interest. To select recombinant viruses expressing the gene of interest, we performed a selection of recombinant thymidine kinase negative and positive for gD by three rounds of plaque purification on RAT-2 cells monolayers which are thymidine kinase null and using bromodeoxyuridine. Recombinant viruses were recovered and confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing and so called RCN-gD.																					CABI:20133032094

Identification of the spinal pathways involved in the recovery of baroreflex control after spinal lesion in the rat using pseudorabies virus. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 303: R590-R598, 2012. First published July 18, 2012; doi: 10.1152/ajpregu.00008.2012.-Neurons in the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM) mediate baroreflex regulation (BR) of spinal sympathetic preganglionic neurons. Previously, our laboratory has shown that recovery of BR occurs in the rat after spinal hemisection. (Zahner MR, Kulikowicz E, and Schramm LP. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 301: R1584-R1590, 2011). The goal of these experiments was to determine whether the observed recovery of BR is mediated by the reorganization of ipsilateral pathways or by compensation by spared contralateral pathways. To determine this, we infected the left kidney in rats with the retrograde transynaptic tracer, pseudorabies virus (PRV), either 1 or 8 wk after left spinal hemisection at either T-3 or T-8, or after a sham lesion. In sham-lesioned rats, PRV infection of RVLM neurons was bilateral. In all rats with a left hemisection, regardless of the location of the lesion (T-3 or T-8) or postlesion recovery time (1 or 8 wk), PRV infection of left RVLM neurons was significantly reduced compared with sham-lesioned rats (P < 0.05). In a separate group of rats, we performed BR tests by measuring responses of left renal sympathetic nerve activity to pharmacologically induced decreases and increases in arterial pressure. In rats with T8 left hemisection and 8-wk recovery, BR was robust, and acute right upper thoracic hemisection abolished all BR of left renal sympathetic nerve activity. Collectively, these data suggest that the recovery of BR is not mediated by reorganization of ipsilateral bulbospinal connections, but instead by improved efficacy of existing contralateral pathways.

Effects of blood sources and artificial blood feeding membranes on the biological parameters and hepatitis C virus infectivity of Culex pipiens (Diptera: Culicidae)								AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY				29	1			262	273		10.4001/003.029.0262				MAR 2021	2021	Culex pipiens (L.) has a wide distribution worldwide and is the main vector of many diseases. Mass rearing of all target vector mosquito species is frequently required for public health research and vector control. Vector mosquito species are anautogenous, they need vertebrate blood for egg production. Therefore, female blood feeding is essential for colonisation. Various artificial feeding methods have been developed over the years but they lack consistency. Thus, we have developed an artificial feeding technique for rearing and infection experiments as an attempt to establish a practical guide for vector research. Culex mosquitoes were fed directly and artificially; four blood sources (human, cattle, rat and pigeon) and three different membranes (chick, sausage casing and Parafilm-M (R)) were assessed based on feeding rate, fecundity, oviposition, egg hatchability and infectivity. The chick membrane was considerably more efficient than sausage casing and Parafilm-M. Using the chick membrane with different blood sources, feeding rates (FR) were 89.60 %, 86.20 %, 61.60 %, 50.40% for human, cattle, rat and pigeon blood, respectively. There was statistically no significant difference in FR between cattle and human blood. Hepatitis C virus infection was carried out successfully using the artificial feeding technique with chick membrane. RT-PCR readings proved that Culex pipiens can harbour this virus for five days through the midgut region. Cattle blood with chick membrane in mosquito rearing is a good substitute for human blood and live feeding for its availability and cost effectiveness. Overall, this method could be recommended in mosquito experimental infection, vectorial capacity and pathogen interactions studies.																					WOS:000635161000025

Transplanted cells were localized with histochemical staining for DPPIV and transgene expression localized with staining for beta-galactosidase (lacZ). The transgene was expressed in 90-100% hepatocytes without impairment in cell viability in vitro, although transplanted cells were cleared mostly within I day by infiltrates containing activated macrophages, CD4(+) or CD8(+) lymphocytes, and phagocytes. When ad beta gal-transduced hepatocytes were transplanted repeatedly at 14-day intervals, transplanted cells were cleared rapidly each time. LacZ expression following Ad beta gal administration to intact animals was associated with apoptosis and unscheduled DNA synthesis in the liver. To determine whether adenoviral antigen expression activated consequential MHC-restricted liver injury, we transplanted Ad beta sal-hepatocytes followed subsequently by transplantation of nontransduced hepatocytes. Transplanted cells expressing Ad beta gal were rapidly cleared as before, whereas nontransduced hepatocytes engrafted with progressive liver repopulation. The findings indicated that adenovirally transduced cells are cleared early in the host liver. Use of ex vivo strategies will facilitate analysis of modified adenoviral vectors in the context of immunoregulatory, cellular and viral mechanisms.																					WOS:000080186700004	10505095

It is unclear whether the ORF2 capsid protein containing the immunodominant epitopes from rabbit HEV differs from those of human HEV. In this study, 661 bile samples collected from domestic rabbits in Jiangsu province, eastern China were amplified by RT-nPCR using a set of HEV universal ORF2 primers. All 42 (6.4%) positive PCR products were sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis using the ORF2 sequences of 557bp in length showed the Jiangsu isolates were separate from HEV genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, avian HEV and rat HEV, and clustered together with rabbit HEV sequences. These 42 isolates were divided into five branches including two newly identified in the present study. Comparison with rabbit HEV sequences from China available in GenBank, using a 298bp ORF2 segment, showed these sequences clustered together into a unique rabbit HEV clade, and were divided into eight sub-branches with high genetic heterogeneity. In addition, 267 serum samples collected from domestic rabbits, serial serum samples from two rhesus monkeys experimentally infected with HEV genotype 1 or 4, and serial serum samples from two New-Zealand rabbits infected experimentally with rabbit HEV were tested simultaneously by EIA using recombinant truncated ORF2 capsid proteins derived from rabbit and human HEV. The virtually identical results obtained suggest that rabbit and human HEV ORF2 antigens contain very similar immunodominant epitopes. All these data are helpful to identify the biological characteristics of the newly identified rabbit HEV. J. Med. Virol. 85:627635, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To investigate the cellular mechanisms by which RSV inhibits amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC), the main pathways through which Na+ ions enter lung epithelial cells, we infected human Clara-like lung (H441) cells with RSV that expresses green fluorescent protein (rRA2). 3-6 days later patch clamp recordings showed that infected cells (i.e. cells expressing green fluorescence; GFP(+)) had significantly lower whole-cell amiloride-sensitive currents and single channel activity (NPo) as compared with non-infected (GFP(-)), non-inoculated, or cells infected with UV-inactivated RSV. Both alpha and beta ENaC mRNA levels were significantly reduced in GFP(+) cells as measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Infection with RSV increased expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrite concentration in the culture medium; nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B p65 subunit and NF-kappa B activation were also up-regulated. iNOS up-regulation in GFP(+) cells was prevented by knocking down I kappa B kinase gamma before infection. Furthermore, pretreatment of H441 cells with the specific iNOS inhibitor 1400W (1 mu M) resulted in a doubling of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current in GFP(+) cells. Additionally, preincubation of H441 cells with A77-1726 (20 mu M), a de novo UTP synthesis inhibitor, and 1400W completely reversed the RSV inhibition of amiloride-sensitive currents in GFP(+) cells. Thus, both UTP- and iNOS-generated reactive species contribute to ENaC down-regulation in RSV-infected airway epithelial cells.																					WOS:000263919000076	19131335

In the thoracic spinal cord of rats with HTLV-I infection, the first event was the appearance of apoptosis of oligodendrocytes beginning at 7 months after induced infection, thereafter followed by the appearance of white matter degeneration, increase of macrophages/activated microglia and of gemistocytic astrocytes at 12, 15 and 20 months, respectively. In the spinal cord, HTLV-I provirus DNA was evident as early as 4 months after the infection, and HTLV-I pX and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha messages began to be expressed at age 7 months, just before or at the same time as the appearance of apoptotic cells. Collective evidence suggests that the apoptotic death of oligodendrocytes, which may be induced either directly by the local expression of HTLV-I or indirectly by TNF-alpha, through the transactive function of p40Tax, is the major cause of chronic progressive myeloneuropathy in Wistar-King-Aptekman-Hokudai rats with HTLV-I infection.

We previously reported that both mRNA and protein expression of inhibitor I of PP2A (I-1(PP2A)) are elevated in AD brain and that this inhibitor induces a dose-dependent inhibition of PP2A activity and tau hyperphosphorylation in NIH3T3 cells. However, whether I-1(PP2A) can induce AD neurofibrillary degeneration and cognitive impairment was not known. In the present study, we infected the brains of rat pups within 24 hours of birth with adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) carrying I-1(PP2A). In the adult AAV1-I-1(PP2A) rats, we found a decrease in PP2A activity and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau in the brain. Immunohistochemistry showed a significant reduction of MAP2 and synapsin 1 in AAV1-I-1(PP2A) animals, suggesting that I-1(PP2A) can induce a loss of dendritic and synaptic plasticity markers. Behavioral tests revealed that infection with AAV1-I-1(PP2A) induced deficits in exploratory activity, spatial reference memory, and memory consolidation in adult rats. These studies suggest that I-1(PP2A) can inhibit PP2A activity, and in turn induce AD neurofibrillary degeneration and cognitive deficits in rats.																					WOS:000351583900010	25589718

Because MOPV is not known to cause human disease, it offers a unique alternative for studying Lassa virus transmission. We investigated how habitat, population density, and host characteristics are related to MOPV occurrence in M. natalensis populations in Morogoro, Tanzania. In 3 contrasting habitats, 511 M. natalensis individuals were trapped, 12.1% (58/480 tested individuals) of which tested seropositive for antibodies and 8.4% (41/489 tested individuals) for MOPV-RNA. Although population densities differ among habitats, density and habitat were not significantly correlated to MOPV-RNA or antibody presence. Antibody presence was not significantly correlated with any host characteristics. In contrast, MOPV-RNA presence was inversely related to weight, age, sexual maturity, and body mass index. The model with body mass index as predictor was the best at predicting infection probability. Thirty-five individuals were exclusively MOPV-RNA positive, 52 were exclusively antibody positive, and 6 were both MOPV-RNA and antibody positive. Interpreting these data using experimental infection results from studies on other arenaviruses, this would mean that these infections were very recent, old, and roughly 1-3 weeks after infection, respectively. The higher RNA prevalence in juveniles implies vertical transmission, or that horizontal transmission occurs mainly in this age group due to lack of immunity, higher susceptibility, and/or higher juvenile contact rates. This study demonstrates the strength of combining information on antibody and RNA presence with host characteristics, and how this information can provide valuable insights into transmission dynamics.

Emerging studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 natural infection of pet dogs and cats is also possible, but its prevalence is not fully understood. Experimentally, it has been demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 replicates more efficiently in cats than in dogs and that cats can transmit the virus through aerosols. With approximately 470 million pet dogs and 370 million pet cats cohabitating with their human owners worldwide, the finding of natural SARS-CoV-2 infection in these household pets has important implications for potential zoonotic transmission events during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as future SARS-related outbreaks. Here, we describe some of the ongoing worldwide surveillance efforts to assess the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 exposure in companion, captive, wild, and farmed animals, as well as provide some perspectives on these efforts including the intra- and inter-species coronavirus transmissions, evolution, and their implications on the human-animal interface along with public health. Some ongoing efforts to develop and implement a new COVID-19 vaccine for animals are also discussed. Surveillance initiatives to track SARS-CoV-2 exposures in animals are necessary to accurately determine their impact on veterinary and human health, as well as define potential reservoir sources of the virus and its evolutionary and transmission dynamics.

J	Zaheer, A; Mathur, SN; Lim, R								Overexpression of glia maturation factor in astrocytes leads to immune activation of microglia through secretion of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor								BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS				294	2			238	244	PII S0006-291X(02)00467-9	10.1016/S0006-291X(02)00467-9				JUN 7 2002	2002	We infected a mixed culture of primary rat astrocytes and microglia with a replication-defective adenovirus carrying the rat glia maturation factor (GMF) cDNA. Affymetrix microarray analysis showed a big increase in the expression of several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II proteins along with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta). Subsequent study using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) yielded the same results with the mixed culture, but not with pure astrocytes or pure microglia. We also noticed that the GMF/virus construct infected only astrocytes but not microglia. This led us to suspect that overexpression of GMF in astrocytes resulted in the secretion of an active substance that stimulated the microglia to express MHC II and IL-1beta, We identified this substance as granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). MHC II are unique to antigen-presenting cells such as microglia and monocytes. The results suggest that GMF in astrocytes can initiate a series of events, leading to immune activation in the nervous system, and implicates its involvement in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

Chikungunya virus populations experience diversity- dependent attenuation and purifying intra-vector selection in Californian Aedes aegypti mosquitoes								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				13	11					e0007853	10.1371/journal.pntd.0007853				NOV 2019	2019	Author summary Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and has caused explosive epidemics in Asia and the Americas since 2004. During mosquito infection, the CHIKV genome replicates with a high mutation rate to produce virus populations with high genetic diversity that facilitate virus evolution. With this study, we address three gaps in knowledge: 1) are Ae. aegypti mosquitoes from Los Angeles, California, capable of transmitting CHIKV, 2) what effect does increased CHIKV population diversity have on virus infection and transmission by mosquitoes, and 3) are there constraints to CHIKV evolution in mosquitoes? We use oral infection of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes originating from Los Angeles, California to demonstrate high laboratory transmission competence of CHIKV. We also show that oral infection of mosquitoes with CHIKV variants that produce more diverse populations are less able to infect mosquitoes than wildtype CHIKV populations. Lastly, our study provides evidence of genome-wide and regional constraints to CHIKV evolution within Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Our results will inform public health risk assessments for potential CHIKV introduction in southern California and advance our understanding of the role of mosquitoes in CHIKV evolution.Chikungunya virus (Togaviridae, Alphavirus; CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne global health threat that has been transmitted transiently in the southeastern United States. A primary CHIKV mosquito vector, Aedes aegypti, was recently established in the populous state of California, but the vector competence of Californian mosquitoes is unknown. Explosive CHIKV epidemics since 2004 have been associated with the acquisition of mosquito-adaptive mutations that enhance transmission by Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus. As a highly mutable RNA virus, CHIKV has the potential for extensive and rapid genetic diversification in vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. We previously demonstrated that expansion of CHIKV diversity in cell culture allows for greater adaptability to novel selection pressures, and that CHIKV fidelity variants are able to diversify more than wildtype (WT) CHIKV in mice. The evolution of intra-vector CHIKV populations and the correlation between CHIKV population diversity and infectivity and transmissibility in mosquitoes has not yet been studied. Here, we address these gaps in knowledge via experimental infection of Ae. aegypti from California with WT and fidelity variant CHIKV. We show that Ae. aegypti from California are highly competent vectors for CHIKV. We also report that CHIKV fidelity variants diversify more than WT in mosquitoes and exhibit attenuated infectivity at the level of the midgut. Furthermore, we demonstrate that intra-vector populations of CHIKV are subjected to purifying selection in mosquito bodies, and sequences of non-coding CHIKV regions are highly conserved. These findings will inform public health risk assessment for CHIKV in California and improve our understanding of constraints to CHIKV evolution in mosquitoes.

Netherlands Stichting voor Diergeneeskundig Onderzoek. Jaarverslag 1967.								109 pp.	109 pp.						1969	1969	At the Amsterdam Branch of the Central Veterinary Laboratory (director: Dr. J G. van Bekkum) 4 million doses of FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE vaccine (against types O1 and O2) for cattle and 1 million doses for pigs were produced. Research on vaccine production and immunization of pigs continued. Attempts to produce a carrier state in vaccinated and unvaccinated pigs, inoculated with type C or type O1 virus, failed; the pigs did not excrete virus for longer than three weeks. A fluorescent antibody test for SWINE FEVER was introduced for routine diagnostic use in 1967, and an indirect technique for swine fever antibody was tried. Experiments were done on the immunization of piglets by two injections of crystal violet vaccine. Transmission experiments with ZWOEGERZIEKTE, a progressive, chronic, interstitial pneumonia of sheep, involved the use of 157 ewes from an infected flock; the incubation period seemed to be very long.The Rotterdam Branch of the Central Veterinary Laboratory (director: Dr. G. M. van Waveren), was concerned with investigations on mycobacteria; bovine mastitis; diseases of calves, pigs, fur animals and poultry; parasitic diseases; serology, virology, chemistry and toxicology; biological products. Studies on RESPIRATORY DISEASES OF PIGS showed that 60% of "contagious sneezing" cases were caused by Bordetella bronchiseptica, and this was controllable by administering sulphadimidine to pregnant sows. The occurrence of Bordetella in the respiratory tract was often associated with atrophy of nasal conchae, while Pasteurella multo-cida was often associated with enzootic pneumonia.SWINE DYSENTERY was becoming commoner on Dutch fattening farms, although recent cases were less acute than formerly. It was associated with a spirillum-like micro-organism which passed 0.8 filters and resisted heating to 50°C for 30 min. ; it was sensitive to neomycin, streptomycin and tylosin. Experimental infection with various micro-organisms commonly cited as causes of swine dysentery gave negative results. The cause of ABORTION IN sows could not be established in 70% of cases; Erysipelo-thrix, Toxoplasma, Aujeszky's disease virus and swine fever virus did not seem to be important causes of abortion. ALEUTIAN DISEASE was the most important cause of loss in mink during 1967; experiments were conducted with an Aleutian disease agent isolated in the Netherlands. Sixty strains of Pseudo-monas aeruginosa were typed: those from a chinchilla farm all belonged to "type 32", strains from g.pigs at the Institute were "type 27" and mink strains were "type 17".

In group 1, buffalo calves,(2) were inoculated with 656865 MICLD50 of street rabies virus (SRV) via oral route. Normal mice brain (5 ml) (NMB) suspension was inoculated via similar route to third buffalo calf serving as control of this group. In group 2, buffalo calves (2) were inoculated with 394119 MICLD50 of SRV via inter-thecal route. NMB suspension (3 ml) was, inoculated via similar route to third buffalo calf serving as control of this group. In group 3, buffalo calves (2) were inoculated with SRV by instilling. 131373 MICLD50 SRV in either eyes. Third buffalo calf of this group was instilled NMB suspension (0.5 ml) into each eye. The enzymic studies of succinic dehydrogenase, acetyle cholinesterase, adenosine triphosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and lactic dehydrogenase were conducted in cryostat sections of nervous tissues. The enzymic activity was affected by neutronal degeneration and necrosis tissues. The enzymic activity was affected by neuronal degeneration and necrosis during progression of experimental disease. Biochemical studies revealed that there was progressive decrease in the level of acetyl cholinesterase during the course of experimental rabies, however, there was no significant change in the level of blood urea nitrogen and cholesterol.

J	Choi, I.; Bouyer, P.; Kolar, A.; Fitzsimonds, R. M.; Boron, W. F.								FUNCTIONAL DISRUPTION OF THE Na+-DRIVEN Cl/HCO3 EXCHANGER NDCBE1 IN HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS.								Society for Neuroscience Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner				2002				Abstract No. 144.4	Abstract No. 144.4						2002	2002	The Na+-driven Cl/HCO3 exchanger NDCBE1 is an important regulator of intracellular pH (pHi) in brain. This membrane protein extrudes acid equivalents by moving Na+ and HCO3- into the cell in exchange for Cl-. To understand how NDCBE1 contributes to pH regulation in neuronal cells, we have disrupted rat NDCBE1 in cultured hippocampal neurons and tested whether the disruption causes changes in the cell's pH phenotype. The catalytic domain of the hammerhead ribozyme was designed to cleave endogenous NDCBE1 mRNA at nucleotide position 2098, which corresponds to apprx700 amino acids into the protein, in the middle of transmembrane segment 6. The ribozyme construct with a 600 bp fragment of NDCBE1 was inserted into Sindbis viral vector pSinRep. The eGFP DNA was introduced downstream from the viral promoter. We infected cultured rat hippocampal neurons with the recombinant viral construct and assessed them 24-38 hours later. Approximately 20% of the neurons were GFP+ and did not show a marked change in the morphology. Using the pH-sensitive dye SNAFL, we then monitored the pHi of a GFP+ neuron as well as a GFP- neuron. In 5% CO2/22 mM HCO3- (pH 7.40 at 37degreeC), the GFP neuron recovered from the acid load and had a slight overshoot. However, the GFP+ neuron failed to recover from the acid load. Acid loading neurons by the NH4+ prepulse technique revealed that pHi recovered rapidly in the GFP- neuron, but slowly in the GFP+ neuron. We observed similar results in six infected coverslips. These results are consistent with decreased Na+-driven Cl/HCO3 exchange in neurons infected with NDCBE1/ribozyme. We are currently processing the neurons from these experiments for immunocytochemistry.					32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience32nd Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience	November 02-07, 2002November 02-07, 2002	Society for NeuroscienceSociety for Neuroscience	Orlando, Florida, USAOrlando, Florida, USA													BCI:BCI200300282044

Six squirrel monkeys infected with HTLV-1 were sacrificed 6, 12, and 35 days and 3, 6, and 26 months after inoculation and 20 organs and tissues were collected from each animal, PCR and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were performed with gag and tar primers. Proviral DNA was detected by PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of monkeys sacrificed 6 days after inoculation and in PBMCs, spleens, and lymph nodes of monkeys sacrificed 12 and 35 days and 3, 6, and 26 months after inoculation. Furthermore, tar/rex mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in the PBMCs of two monkeys 8 to 12 days after inoculation and in the spleens and lymph nodes of the monkey sacrificed on day 12, in this animal, scattered HTLV-1 tax/rex mRNA-positive lymphocytes were detected by in situ hybridization in frozen sections of the spleen, around the germinal centers and close to the arterial capillaries. Anti-HTLV-1 tell-mediated immunity was evaluated at various times after inoculation. Anti-p40(Tax) and anti-Env cytolytic T-cell responses were detected 2 months after infection and remained detectable thereafter. When Tax peptides were used, this response appeared to be directed against various Tax epitopes, Our results indicate that squirrel monkeys represent a promising animal model for studying the early events of HTLV-1 infection and for evaluating candidate vaccines against HTLV-1.

However, relatively high doses are required to achieve protection. In this study, we identified the functional properties of a porcine fusion protein, poIRF7/3(5D), as a biotherapeutic and enhancer of IFN activity against FMD virus (FMDV). We showed that poIRF7/3(5D) is a potent inducer of type I IFNs, including alpha IFN (IFN-alpha), IFN-beta, and IFN-omega but not type III IFN (interleukin-28B), without inducing cytotoxicity. Expression of poIRF7/3(5D) significantly and steadily reduced FMDV titers by up to 6 log(10) units in swine and bovine cell lines. Treatment with an IFN receptor inhibitor (B18R) combined with an anti-IFN-alpha antibody neutralized the antiviral activity in the supernatants of cells transduced with an Ad5 vector expressing poIRF7/3(5D) [Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D)]. However, several transcripts with known antiviral function, including type I IFNs, were still highly upregulated (range of increase, 8-fold to over 500-fold) by poIRF7/3(5D) in the presence of B18R. Furthermore, the sera of mice treated with Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) showed antiviral activity that was associated with the induction of high levels of IFN-alpha and resulted in complete protection against FMDV challenge at 6, 24, or 48 h posttreatment. This study highlights for the first time the antiviral potential of Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) in vitro and in vivo against FMDV.IMPORTANCEFMD remains one of the most devastating diseases that affect livestock worldwide. Effective vaccine formulations are available but are serotype specific and require approximately 7 days before they are able to elicit protective immunity. We have shown that vector-delivered IFN is an option to protect animals against many FMDV serotypes as soon as 24 h and for about 4 days postadministration. Here we demonstrate that delivery of a constitutively active transcription factor that induces the production of endogenous IFNs and potentially other antiviral genes is a viable strategy to protect against FMD.

In the spinal cord, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) induces an AFM-like disease with gray matter inflammation during the acute phase, 1 week post infection (p.i.), and an MS-like disease with white matter inflammation during the chronic phase, 1 month p.i. Although gut microbiota has been proposed to affect immune responses contributing to pathological conditions in remote organs, including the brain pathophysiology, its precise role in neuroinflammatory diseases is unclear. We infected SJL/J mice with TMEV; harvested feces and spinal cords on days 4 (before onset), 7 (acute phase), and 35 (chronic phase) p.i.; and examined fecal microbiota by 16S rRNA sequencing and CNS transcriptome by RNA sequencing. Although TMEV infection neither decreased microbial diversity nor changed overall microbiome patterns, it increased abundance of individual bacterial genera Marvinbryantia on days 7 and 35 p.i. and Coprococcus on day 35 p.i., whose pattern-matching with CNS transcriptome showed strong correlations: Marvinbryantia with eight T-cell receptor (TCR) genes on day 7 and with seven immunoglobulin (Ig) genes on day 35 p.i.; and Coprococcus with gene expressions of not only TCRs and IgG/IgA, but also major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and complements. The high gene expression of IgA, a component of mucosal immunity, in the CNS was unexpected. However, we observed substantial IgA positive cells and deposition in the CNS, as well as a strong correlation between CNS IgA gene expression and serum anti-TMEV IgA titers. Here, changes in a small number of distinct gut bacteria, but not overall gut microbiota, could affect acute and chronic immune responses, causing AFM- and MS-like lesions in the CNS. Alternatively, activated immune responses would alter the composition of gut microbiota. Copyright: CC BY 4.0																					DRCI:DATA2020165019769846		
J	Bhalla, Nishank; Gardner, Christina L.; Downs, Sierra N.; Dunn, Matthew; Sun, Chengqun; Klimstra, William B.								Macromolecular Synthesis Shutoff Resistance by Myeloid Cells Is Critical to IRF7-Dependent Systemic Interferon Alpha/Beta Induction after Alphavirus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	24					e00872-19	10.1128/JVI.00872-19				DEC 2019	2019	Alphavirus infection of fibroblastic cell types in vitro inhibits host cell translation and transcription, leading to suppression of interferon alpha/beta (IFN alpha/beta) production. However, the effect of infection upon myeloid cells, which are often the first cells encountered by alphaviruses in vivo, is unclear. Previous studies demonstrated an association of systemic IFN-alpha/beta production with myeloid cell infection efficiency. Murine infection with wild-type Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), a highly myeloid-cell-tropic alphavirus, results in secretion of very high systemic levels of IFN-alpha/beta, suggesting that stress responses in responding cells are active. Here, we infected myeloid cell cultures with VEEV to identify the cellular source of IFN-alpha/beta, the timing and extent of translation and/or transcription inhibition in infected cells, and the transcription factors responsible for IFN-alpha/beta induction. In contrast to fibroblast infection, myeloid cell cultures infected with VEEV secreted IFN-alpha/beta that increased until cell death was observed. VEEV inhibited translation in most cells early after infection (<6 h postinfection (p.i.]), while transcription inhibition occurred later (>6 h p.i.). Furthermore, the interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), but not IRF3, transcription factor was critical for IFN-alpha/beta induction in vitro and in sera of mice. We identified a subset of infected Raw 264.7 myeloid cells that resisted VEEV-induced translation inhibition and secreted IFN-alpha/beta despite virus infection. However, in the absence of IFN receptor signaling, the size of this cell population was diminished. These results indicate that IFN-alpha/beta induction in vivo is IRF7 dependent and arises in part from a subset of myeloid cells that are resistant, in an IFN-alpha/beta dependent manner, to VEEV-induced macromolecular synthesis inhibition.IMPORTANCE Most previous research exploring the interaction of alphaviruses with host cell antiviral responses has been conducted using fibroblast lineage cell lines. Previous studies have led to the discovery of virus-mediated activities that antagonize host cell antiviral defense pathways, such as host cell translation and transcription inhibition and suppression of STAT1 signaling. However, their relevance and impact upon myeloid lineage cell types, which are key responders during the initial stages of alphavirus infection in vivo, have not been well studied. Here, we demonstrate the different abilities of myeloid cells to resist VEEV infection compared to nonmyeloid cell types and begin to elucidate the mechanisms by which host antiviral responses are upregulated in myeloid cells despite the actions of virus-encoded antagonists.

J	MOOSER, H.; CASTANEDA, M. RUIZ								The multiplication of the virus of Mexican typhus fever in fleas								JOUR EXP MED				55	(2)			307	323		10.1084/jem.55.2.307				1932	1932	Examination of Leptopsylla musculi, Xenopsylla cheopis and Ceratophyllus fasciatus from rats, of Ctenocephalus canis from dogs and of C. felis from cats in Mexico City, both by animal inoculation and direct study of stained section, demonstrated the great ease with which these fleas can be infected with Mexican Rickettsia by feeding on experimentally infected rats. Furthermore, in contrast to Pediculus and Polyplax, most of these insects survived the infection in spite of the continued multiplication of Rickettsia in the Malpighian tubules. The relatively insignificant role these fleas play in spreading epidemic typhus in man may in part be explained by the following facts: (1) Disinclination of Xenopsylla and Ceratophyllus to leave the rat host, and unlikelihood of Leptopsylla attacking man; (2) only a small number of Rickettsias are present in the lumen of the intestinal tract of fleas, rendering the excreta less infectious; (3) fleas are less irritating and are less likely to induce scratching; (4) the body of the flea is more strongly chitinized than that of the louse and is therefore less likely to be crushed. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: H.

Annual Report 1986/1987.								iii + 45 pp.	iii + 45 pp.						1988	1988	The 47 projects undertaken at the research institute are listed. The list includes some which have been completed and reported in earlier reports. Details are given in the report of those which were still under investigation during 1986/87. They included the following projects: a serological survey of 651 cattle, 112 buffaloes and 240 horses from different areas of Indonesia showed that 23-81% of cattle, 39-90% of bufflaoes and 0-5% horses had antibodies to Trypanosoma evansi.A study of faecal samples taken from 304 goats in East Java in 1986/87 showed that 7% of goats were infected with Fasciola,7% with Paramphistomum,1.6% with Trichurisand 67% with coccidial oocysts. An ELISA for the diagnosis of haemorrhagic septicaemia was developed and compared with the passive mouse protection test. It was useful and sensitive but required further development. A serological survey for malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), which may not be caused by the same virus that causes MCF in Africa, showed that 3-79% of the 279 cattle tested in the various regions were positive. A study in buffaloes experimentally infected with Fasciola giganticashowed that triclabendazole reduced fluke number by 18-73% but that it was less effective against immature flukes. Further experiments showed that some sheep were probably resistant to F. gigantica.Of 127 salmonella isolates collected from West Kalimantan in 1986 and 1987, 20 serotypes were identified; they included S. agona(37 isolates), S. amsterdam(17), S typhimurium(17), S. weltevreden(14) and S. biafra(10). An ELISA was used to study infectious bronchitis infections in chickens in West Java; infection rates varied from 0-17.3%. A serological survey of 1053 cattle for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis showed that 6.8% were positive; the infection rates varied from 0 to 50% in the various areas. An oral Newcastle disease vaccine derived from the V4 strain of the virus was being tested under laboratory and field conditions. An ELISA for Anaplasma marginaleshowed that 72% of 264 samples from cattle and buffaloes in North Sumatra and 77% of 276 from Sumba were positive. During the year 12 cases of rabies were confirmed, 9 in dogs and 3 in cattle. Serological surveys showed that 50-75% of large ruminants and 20-30% of small ruminants were positive to bluetongue virus (BTV); the most prevalent serotype was BTV20. Antibody to epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus and BTV types 21, 12 and 1 were also detected. Liver samples collected from 179 buffaloes and cows at a slaughter house were examined for Clostridium novyiby a fluorescent antibody technique; 20% of samples were positive. A serological survey for bovine leukosis showed that 13% of dairy cattle in Aceh, less than 1% of dairy and 2% of beef cattle in West Java and 2.5% of dairy cattle in East Sumba were positive.

J	Boldogkoi, Z; Szabo, A; Vrbova, G; Nogradi, A								Pseudorabies virus-based gene delivery to rat embryonic spinal cord grafts								HUMAN GENE THERAPY				13	6			719	729		10.1089/104303402317322285				APR 10 2002	2002	The construction and application of recombinant pseudorabies viruses (PrVs) for the delivery of beta-galactosidase and/or green fluorescent protein (GFP) genes to rat embryonic spinal cord cells are reported here. These viruses were specifically designed to infect embryonic spinal cord neurons, which can be grafted into a lesioned spinal cord in order to restore the lost functions of the host cord. The recombinant viruses were constructed in two steps. The small subunit of the ribonucleotide reductase (RR) gene was first abolished by a frameshift mutation and an expression cassette containing the lacZ gene alone or together with the GFP gene was then inserted in place of the early protein 0 (EP0) gene of PrV. The reporter gene cassettes were positioned downstream from the PrV latency-associated promoter. Using an ex vivo system, we infected embryonic spinal cord explants with these viruses and found that neither vRREP0lac nor vRREP0lacgfp exerted any cytotoxic effect at all. It was also revealed that these viruses infect embryonic cells with high efficiency, and that infected neurons grafted into the spinal cord express the inserted reporter genes for periods of up to 12 weeks. This system offers a new approach for foreign gene transfer to neurons grafted into the CNS.																					WOS:000175100300004	11936971

In addition, we evaluated whether T-helper type 1 (Th1)- and Th2-type cytokines modulate the release of NO in response to RSV infection. To do this, we infected monolayers of A549 cells with RSV and determined nitrite levels in the supernatant fluids. We also measured nitrite levels in human small-airway epithelial cells (SAEC) in primary culture and in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from Balb/c mice after RSV infection. To further support our observations in these analyses, we performed immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis for inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in A549 cells. To evaluate the regulation of NO production in response to RSV, we performed experiments in the absence and presence of the Th1 and Th2 type cytokines: interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-13. In addition, we assessed the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone on iNOS in RSV infected A549 cells. Results were expressed in terms of nmol/mg protein and shown as percents of control values (mean +/- SE). RSV increased the release of nitrites in A549 cells, SAEC, and BALE. The increase in nitrite levels was supported by immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis for iNOS protein in A549 cells, indicating activation of iNOS in response to RSV infection. IFN-gamma and IL-13 did not affect the RSV-induced increase in NO production. By contrast, IL-4 and dexamethasone suppressed the release of NO in response to RSV infection. These observations show that RSV infection leads to activation of iNOS within the airway epithelium and that IL-4 and dexamethasone inhibit the production of NO in response to RSV infection.

Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station					50			15 pp.	15 pp.						1940	1940	The virus of the western strain of equine encephalomyelitis was isolated in June and July 1940 from 4 out of 6 collections of Triatoma sanguisuga Lec., obtained in Kansas from pastures in an area in which horses were grazing and in which several cases of the disease had occurred. This bug is common throughout the State and over much of the region in which equine encephalomyelitis has occurred, and is known to feed on horses in nature. Details are given of the experiments by which the virus was identified. The bugs from each group that were not used for its direct isolation were placed in cages in contact with susceptible guineapigs. One of the guineapigs succumbed 28 days after entering the cage, and the virus was isolated from the brain and is now in its third serial passage.An appendix includes a brief history of equine encephalomyelitis and a note by R. C. Smith on the biology of Triatoma sangiiisuga. It is a tropical and sub-tropical species, but its range extends northward through the Great Plains area. All stages live in rodent burrows and nests. The bugs feed largely on the blood of vertebrates and have been reported as attacking other insects also. They are nocturnal and are attracted to light. They overwinter as partly grown nymphs or adults. Eggs are deposited fiom June to September, there being only one generation annually.																					CABI:19411000080

Ultrastructural evidence of the ehrlichial developmental cycle in naturally infected Ixodes persulcatus ticks in the course of coinfection with Rickettsia, Borrelia, and a flavivirus								VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES				7	4			699	716		10.1089/vbz.2007.0148				WIN 2007	2007	Ehrlichiae are small gram-negative obligately intracellular bacteria that multiply within vacuoles of their host cells and are associated for a part of their life cycle with ticks, which serve as vectors for vertebrate hosts. Two morphologically and physiologically different ehrlichial cell types, reticulate cells (RC) and dense-cored cells (DC), are observed during experimental infection of cell cultures, mice, and ticks. Dense-cored cells and reticulate cells in vertebrate cell lines alternate in a developmental cycle. We observed ultrastructure of RC and DC of Ehrlichia muris in morulae in salivary gland cells and coinfection with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s1), "Candidatus Rickettsia tarasevichiae," and a flavivirus (presumably, tick-borne encephalitis virus [TBEV]) of Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in the Cis-Ural region of Russia. Polymerase chain reaction revealed 326 (81.5%) of 400 ticks carrying at least one infectious agent, and 41.5% (166 ticks) were coinfected with two to four agents. Ehrlichiae and rickettsiae were identified by sequencing of 359 bp of the 16S rRNA gene of E. muris and of 440 bp of the 16S rRNA gene and 385 bp of the gltA gene of "R. tarasevichiae." Different organs of the same tick harbored different microorganisms: TBEV in salivary gland and borreliae in midgut; E. muris in salivary gland; and "R. tarasevichiae" in midgut epithelium. Salivary gland cells contained both RC and DC, a finding that confirmed the developmental cycle in naturally infected ticks. Dense-cored cells in tick salivary glands were denser and of more irregular shape than DC in cell cultures. Ehrlichia-infected salivary gland cells had lysed cytoplasm, suggesting pathogenicity of E. muris for the tick host at the cellular level, as well as potential transmission during feeding. Rickettsiae in the midgut epithelial cells multiplied to significant numbers without altering the host cell ultrastructure. This is the first demonstration of E. muris, "R. tarasevichiae," and the ehrlichial developmental cycle in naturally infected I. persulcatus ticks.

Infectious CDG virus was recovered from oropharyngeal secretions, urine, or solid tissues of nine of 12 animals killed on day 9 post-inoculation (PI), 14 of 24 animals killed on day 18 or 27 PI, and none of 12 animals killed on day 54 PI. In addition, virus-specific RNA was detected in the kidneys of six of the 12 animals killed on day 54 PI, and adult cotton rats inoculated with the kidneys of four animals killed on day 54 PI developed antibody to CDG virus. Collectively, the results indicate that CDG virus can establish lengthy (perhaps lifelong) infections in Alston's cotton rat and thus support the concept that S. alstoni is the principal host of CDG virus.

Course of the infection and morphology of the lesions in different species of rodents								ACTA MED POL				7	(1)			71	82						1966	1966	Pathogenicity of the Coxsackie A-7 virus for some rodents used in laboratory investigations has been described by many authors. Nevertheless, there is a lack of exact data concerning the course of the infection in the animals and particularly on morphology of infection. The present study describes the course of the infection and patterns of morphologic lesions in hooded rats, hamsters, guinea pigs and rabbits. All the animals were infected with Coxsackie A-7 virus under identical conditions. Syrian hamsters appeared to be most susceptible to the infection. White mice, hooded rats were less, and rabbits and guinea pigs were least susceptible. The morphologic patterns of the muscular lesions in infected animals had the character of degenerative [long dash] inflammatory lesions, and their intensity and localization depended on age and species of the rodents. Central nervous system lesions were observed only in some of the animals mainly in those exhibiting higher susceptibility to the infection. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19674800008423	5945722

At least one of these characteristic features of provocation could be demonstrated in each experimental series. The provocational effect was not so marked as in experiments with bacteria. If a heterologous vaccine prepared of heat inactivated Salmonella typhimurium is used, provocation is more pronounced. Especially a considerable increase in mortality can regularly be demonstrated among the animals within 24 hours after incubation time. If mice are vaccinated prior to the intracerebral infection 3 times against poliomyelitis, no provocation can be observed after the vaccination during incubation time. Mortality of the pre-vaccinated animals was considerably less than that of the controls. The 4th vaccine injection during incubation period evidently produced additional protection. The epidemiological experiences concerning specific and unspecific provocation of poliomyelitis are confirmed by our experiments on animals; at least no contradictions occur between experiment and empirics. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19624000019892	13854444	
J	Angelova, Assia L.; Geletneky, Karsten; Nueesch, Jurg P. F.; Rommelaere, Jean								Tumor selectivity of oncolytic parvoviruses: from in vitro and animal models to cancer patients								FRONTIERS IN BIOENGINEERING AND BIOTECHNOLOGY				3						55	10.3389/fbioe.2015.00055				2015	2015	Oncolytic virotherapy of cancer is among the innovative modalities being under development and especially promising for targeting tumors, which are resistant to conventional treatments. Presently, at least a dozen of viruses, belonging to nine different virus families, are being tested within the frames of various clinical studies in cancer patients. Continuously growing preclinical evidence showing that the autonomous rat parvovirus H-1 (H-1PV) is able to kill tumor cells that resist conventional treatments and to achieve a complete cure of various human tumors in animal models argues for its inclusion in the arsenal of oncolytic viruses with an especially promising bench to bedside translation potential. Oncolytic parvovirus safe administration to humans relies on the intrinsic preference of these agents for quickly proliferating, metabolically, and biochemically disturbed tumor versus normal cells (tumor selectivity or oncotropism). The present review summarizes and discusses (i) preclinical evidence of H-1PV innocuousness for normal cells and healthy tissues in vitro and in animals, respectively, (ii) toxicological assessments of H-1PV mono- or combined therapy in tumor-bearing virus-permissive animal models, as well as (iii) historical results of experimental infection of human cancer patients with H-1PV. Altogether, these data argue against a risk of H-1PV inducing significant toxic effects in human patients. This highly favorable safety profile allowed the translation of H-1PV preclinical research into a Phase I/IIa clinical trial being currently in progress.

We analyzed the expression of the genes Mumig, crg-2, and IFN-gamma during experimental infections with Plasmodium yoelii, Toxoplasma gondii, and vaccinia virus. Mumig, crg-2 and IFN-gamma were induced in multiple organs. During the acute phase of each infection as well as after i.p. injection of rIFN-gamma, levels of Mumig mRNA in the liver were as high or higher than levels in any of the other organs. In contrast, the organs showing the highest expression of crg-2 and IFN-gamma varied among the experimental models, with induction of these latter two genes colocalizing. Differences in relative levels of expression of Mumig and crg-2 in liver and spleen were not demonstrably due to expression of the genes in different cell types within these organs. We showed that both Mumig and crg-2 are induced in the liver in hepatocytes and in the spleen in CD11b(+) cells. IFN-gamma was necessary for induction of Mumig during infections with T. gondii or vaccinia virus. In contrast, induction of crg-2 was not completely dependent on IFN-gamma. These data demonstrate that despite the overlap in activities within chemokine subsets, chemokine genes show differences in their patterns of expression and in their responses to inducers that suggest nonredundant roles in vivo. Moreover, the pattern of induction of crg-2 is consistent with Crg-2 acting primarily locally, while the pattern for Mumig induction suggests that Mumig induction suggests that MuMig may have a systemic role during infection.

Australian Veterinary Journal				11				212	228		10.1111/j.1751-0813.1935.tb04081.x				1935	1935	Infectious laryngotracheitis in fowls is recorded from New South Wales for the first time.The clinical and pathological features of the disease encountered, together with its highly contagious nature, strongly suggested that it was identical with infectious laryngotracheitis as described by BEACH in the United States of America. Cross-immunization experiments carried out with American virus both by the authors and by MOHLER in America showed the two diseases to be identical. Cross-immunity experiments showed no antigenic difference between several outbreaks in N.'S.W. BURNET, who collaborated with the authors, was able to propagate the virus on the chorio-allantoic membrane of developing eggs and the lesions so produced agreed with those described by BEACH. Cultures on developing eggs reproduced the disease in fowls.Usually about 48 hours elapse between artificial infection and the appearance of symptoms, the chief of which are violent coughing and gasping breathing. The incubation period is usually from six to ten days when infection takes place by contact. Evidence of the existence of carriers was obtained when three out of 87 swabs taken from recovered birds reproduced the disease in other birds.The clinical features and history of 12 outbreaks are recorded in detail. In the peracute type, which is characterized by haemorrhagic tracheitis, 80 to 100 per cent, of the flock becomes aifected and 10 to 15 per cent, may die, death usually occurring on the second day after the onset of symptoms. In the acute type there is no haemorrhage into the trachea, but the mortality may be as high as 40 per cent. Transmission of the disease from the acute type is sometimes not possible. In the chronic type the chief symptoms are unthriftiness and oral breathing, and the lesions are diphtheresis of the upper air passages, sometimes with panophthal-mia. An asymptomatic type of the disease is recognized since certain birds exposed to infection show no symptoms but are later found to be immune.The disease occurs mainly in birds under one year old. Differential diagnosis is discussed. The best means of differentiating the chronic form from the diphtheritic form of fowl pox is to inoculate material into (a) the comb, and (b) the trachea of experimental fowls, when typical lesions of either disease should develop.Intratracheal injection, by means of a pipette passed through the glottis, was the routine method of inoculation used for reproducing laryngotracheitis. Spraying or swabbing the throat, intranasal injection, instillation into the conjunctival sac and contact with infected birds also led to infection. Infection was sometimes, but not constantly, produced by intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection and by oral administration in the drinking water or food. The infective dose of tracheal exudate from infected birds, either fresh or after five days' storage, was 0-000125 ml., and of cultures on developing eggs 0.000066 g. The disease could not be set up with emulsions of various internal organs of infected birds. The serum of recovered birds neutralized the virus when mixed with it for an hour before inoculation. The disease could not be reproduced in turkeys, ducks, starlings, quail, pigeons, sparrows, guineapigs, rabbits, rats or mice, but MOHLER was able to infect pheasants with virus sent to him.-W. I. B.

Therefore the method of choice is still the virus-neutralization test on cell cultures and on suckling mice resp., i.e. methods which are expensive and time consuming and demanding on laboratory equipment. The detection of antibodies against the Coxsackie virus by means of Western blotting revealed a specific reaction of commercial hyperimmune diagnostic rabbit sera as well as of sera obtained after oral infection of mice.

[1999] J. Neurosci. 19:1038-1048; Ulupinar et al. [2000a] J. Comp, Neurol 425:622-630). In wholemount explant cultures of embryonic rat trigeminal ganglion and brainstem or in dissociated cell cultures of the trigeminal ganglion, exogenous supply of NGF leads to axonal elongation, whereas neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) treatment leads to short branching and arborization (Ulupinar et al. [2000a] J. Comp. Neurol. 425:622-630). Axonal responses to neurotrophins might be mediated via the Rho GTPases. To investigate this possibility, we prepared wholemount trigeminal pathway cultures from E15 rats. We infected the ganglia with recombinant vaccinia viruses that express GFP-tagged dominant negative Rac, Rho, or constitutively active Rac or treated the cultures with lysophosphatitic acid (LPA) to activate Rho. We then examined axonal responses to NGF by use of the lipophilic tracer DiI. Rac activity induced longer axonal growth from the central trigeminal tract, whereas the dominant negative construct of Rac eliminated NGF-induced axon outgrowth. Rho activity also significantly reduced, and the Rho dominant negative construct increased, axon growth from the trigeminal tract. Similar alterations in axonal responses to NT-3 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor were also noted. Our results demonstrate that Rho GTPases play a major role in neurotrophin-induced axonal differentiation of embryonic trigeminal axons. J. Comp. Neurol. 438:377-387, 2001.

Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 19[40-]41.								92 pp.	92 pp.						1941	1941	A report is given of the progress made during the year ending 30th June 1941 in the campaign for the eradication of Boophilus annulatus, Say, on cattle and other animals in the United States and in Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where the tropical variety microplus, Can. (australis, Fuller) is prevalent. The situation in the United States changed little in comparison with the previous year [R.A.E., B 29 119], though the total area under quarantine was slightly reduced. The remainder of Porto Rico and St. Thomas and St. John were released from quarantine, and progress was made in the removal of tick-infested deer from St. Croix.Experiments continued in Colorado, Texas and New Mexico on the effectiveness in the control of Hypoderma lineatum, ViIl, on cattle of washes of derris and cube powder [cf. 30 10] mixed at the time of treatment and washes containing derris and soap powders or 12 oz. derris and 4, 6 and 8 oz. fused bentonite sulphur compounded and stored dry for 30 days before use indicated the existence of little, if any, difference in the relative effectiveness of the various washes. The first treatment was made 30 days after the first larval openings appeared and was sometimes followed by a second after 37-40 days. The washes containing soap penetrated the hair better than those containing bentonite sulphur. The percentage effectiveness of single treatments varied from 60 to 100, with an average of about 90. The washes reached maximum effectiveness in 10-15 days and ceased to be effective 25-30 days after application. Two treatments with derris washes failed to give complete kill. One application to cattle and goats infested with various species of Jice of a wash or spray of 1 Ib. derris powder containing 5 per cent. rotenone in 100 U.S. gals, water or a dust of 10 per cent. of the derris powder in an. inert carrier killed all lice but not the eggs. Two treatments at an interval of 16-17 days eradicated the lice.																					CABI:19421000270

The strong increase of DNAase I, appearing 24 hr. after infection and further rising up to 48 hr. in liver tissue and up to 60 hr. in spleen tissue, was confirmed. The increase of DNAase I activity of infected tissues, in comparison with normal tissues, can be due to variations of the specific tissue inhibitor (labile by 4[degree]C storage). The hypothesis that increased DNAase I activity is essentially due to viral multiplication, is confirmed. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth																					BCI:BCI19674800070700

The viruses after adaptation acquired the capacity to multiply rapidly to high titers in skeletal muscles of newborn mice causing severe paralysis, but losing their cytopathic effect. Differences in pathomorphological changes occurring in newborn and 5[long dash]6 week-old mice after inoculation with mouse-adapted ECHO viruses were established. By the pattern of lesions caused by ECHO11 and ECHO13 viruses in mice, these viruses are similar to Coxsackie B group, the similarity is increased if the antigenic variability ahd hemagglutinating capacity of these viruses are taken into account. ECHO8 virus was similar to Coxsackie A group. The lack of hem agglutinating capacity, the presence of cytopathic effect and occurrence of mouse pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains belonging to combined "ECHO[long dash]ECHO8" virus increase the similarity of this virus to Coxsackie A9 and Coxsackie A23 (ECHO9) viruses. The obtained data concerning pathomorphological changes in mice caused by ECHO7 virus do not permit clear definition of its similarity to members of one of Coxsackie group of viruses, but by its antigenic variability and hemagglutinating capacity this virus is closer to Coxsackie group B viruses. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth																					BCI:BCI19684900052184	5611753

Pasteur				37	5			498	527						1923, May	1923	The disease occurs as an epidemic and its spread through a flock is: .extremely rapid. Young animals, especially those that are being fattened for the butcher, are the most frequently affected. The disease has a very wide distribution, and it occurs more frequently in France since the war than formerly.Sometimes the lesions remain confined to the lips, where dark coloured crusts are formed. Sometimes there is oedema of the lips. The first phase of the lesions is represented by erosions of variable size, which are easily caused to bleed. Neither a vesicular nor pustular stage is observed. The crusts result from the abundant serous exudate from the eroded surfaces. Sometimes they develop on the eyelids, and they may in fact be observed on any part that is devoid of wool as a result of direct inoculation. On a single animal lesions in various stages of development may be seen. When the lesions remain confined to the lips the affected animals are not inconvenienced, and continue to feed, but when the interior of the mouth is invaded the disease has serious consequences. Salivation is pronounced and the affected animals are unable to feed. The disease runs its course in about 12 days. At the post-mortem examination the author has always found a secondary pneumonia due to a pasteurella. He has never found the specific lesions in the respiratory tract. Death is, in fact, due to the secondary invaders, and the mortality depends to some extent upon their virulence. The mortality may be up to 20 per cent. or even higher. The disease is easily reproduced by inoculation, and the best site is on the inner aspect of the thigh, where light scarifications may be made. Evidence of infection is first seen on the third day when the scarifications are reddened. By the sixth day vesicles form along the scarifications. These contain a clear watery liquid. Subsequently, the exudate increases in amount and becomes purulent. The covering of the pustule then becomes detached and the typical crusts form. Though the neighbouring glands may become enlarged, there is no systematic disturbance. The crusts become detached about the twentieth day, exposing cicatrized epidermis. Inoculation on the mucous membrane of the mouth by scarification usually fails because the virus is washed away by the saliva, but if the virus is introduced into the epithelium by puncture with needles success is sometimes achieved. Crusts do not form on lesions of the mucous membrane for obvious reasons.Histological examination shows that the lesions begin in the thickness of the epithelial layer.The disease is not transmissible experimentally save by endermic inoculation, and animals of all ages can be infected by experiment. Goats are as susceptible as sheep, and passage through the goat does not prevent the virus from being retransferred to the sheep. The author has succeeded in infecting calves either with lymph direct from a sheep or after passage through a goat.Rabbits, guineapigs, rats, mice, pigs, donkeys, foals, and birds all appear to be immune.The crust and lymph are both virulent and it has been found possible to produce infection with dilutions of 1 in 10, 000, or even 1 in 100, 000. The bulk of the virus is closely associated with the cellular elements. It retains its virulence for a month and perhaps longer in glycerin, but the maximum has not been ascertained, since it is more convenient to keep it in the dry state. Dry crusts maintain their virulence for a year.Positive results have been obtained with fresh lymph after filtration through earthenware filters. Centrifugation does not appear to cause the virus to become sedimented. It is difficult to explain this, but it simplifies the preparation of a vaccine free from contaminations. The virus is killed in 30 minutes by a temperature of 56° C. Dry virus is rather more resistant than lymph. Immunity is acquired about three weeks after infection. It has been found that immunity can be conferred by intravenous inoculation, but not by ingestion. The author has not been able to detect any antibodies in the serum. The question is raised as to whether chancre of the sheep and vaccinia are in reality identical. The author, mainly upon the grounds of animal experimentation, comes to the conclusion that they are separate entities. The experiments included cross immunity tests.For protective inoculation the author has used dried scabs from experimentally infected animals. Powdered scabs are mixed with 50 per cent. glycerin in the proportion of 1 part to 100.Vaccination is practised on the inner aspect of the thigh, the only instruments necessary are a Chambon lancet and swabs on stiff wire handles. Fifty cubic centimetres of vaccine is sufficient for 200 animals.It is admitted that it is possible for a vaccinated animal to infect a healthy one and set up the disease, but in practice this risk is found to be negligible. Vaccination does not prevent the evolution of the disease in animals already actually infected. Vaccination is advised even in infected flocks with a view to shortening the duration of the disease in the herd.																					CABI:19246300143		
J	CROSS, H. E.								Are Camels Susceptible to Blackquarter, Haemorrhagic Septicaemia and Rinderpest ?								Bulletin, Agricultural Research Institute, Pusa					 80.			17 pp.	17 pp.						1918	1918	Blackquarter. Although outbreaks of blackquarter similar to those occurring among cattle have not been reported in camels, deaths from this disease are occasionally stated to take place. In order to determine the susceptibility of camels to the disease three camels (two one-year olds and one seven-years old) were inoculated intramuscularly with blackquarter virus, one young buffalo and one young calf acting as controls.The first symptom noticed in the inoculated camels was a rise of temperature followed by a suspension of rumination and loss of appetite. The animals then showed a disinclination to stand and were lame on being forced to move. A swelling then soon appeared around the seat of inoculation which rapidly increased in size and became emphysematous. Breathing became difficult, the camel then lay on its side and was unable to get up. The temperature fell rapidly just before death, which took place in 37 1/2 and 38 1/2 hours in the yearling camels and in 63 1/2 hours after inoculation in the seven year old camel. The control buffalo died after 23 1/2 and the calf after 45 1/2 hours.On post-mortem examination the only lesion found was a large emphysematous swelling at the seat of inoculation. The muscles of this part were of a dark brown to a black colour and of a slightly rancid odour.From these results the author concludes that " camels are as susceptible to blackquarter as cattle." [These results, however, appear to be entirely illusory in as much as they only demonstrate the susceptibility of camels towards artificial inoculation with the blackquarter organism, but do not necessarily throw light on the susceptibility of these animals towards natural attacks. Guinea-pigs, for example, can be killed with certainty by experimental inoculation with small quantities of virus although the natural disease in these animals is unknown. Also, the immunity of adult cattle towards the natural affection is very great, whereas by experimental inoculation the author succeeded in killing a seven year old camel.-ED.]Haemorrhagic septicaemia. In India the losses among cattle from this disease are very considerable but it is not known whether it may be the cause of death in camels.The author inoculated subcutaneously two camels with an artificial culture of the haemorrhagic septicaemia organism and simultaneously two calves and two rabbits as controls. In the case of one of the camels, a male, one year old, the temperature rose to 104.8°F. ten hours after the inoculation. A slight swelling, hot and painful, appeared in 34 hours at the seat of inoculation but the appetite was maintained throughout and the temperature became normal 74 hours after inoculation. The other camel-a male seven years old- showed a very slight rise in temperature 34 hours after the inoculation, and a slight swelling appeared at the seat of inoculation which disappeared after two days; the camel fed well throughout the experiment. Death was rapidly produced in the control animals inoculated.The author then quotes GAIGER'S experiments in this connection and concludes from the information thus gained that " camels are not very susceptible to haemorrhagic septicaemia."Rinderpest. Although outbreaks of this disease are stated not to occur amongst camels deaths from it are occasionally reported but no reliable information on this point is available.Three camels (one one-year old, one six-year old, and one 12-year old) were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 c.c. of virulent rinderpest blood, two calves,] 1 months old, being inoculated simultaneously as controls. The one-year old and six-year old camels are stated to have developed typical symptoms of rinderpest. The latter after an incubation period of seven days showed a rise of temperature, inappetence, vesicles on the lips and tongue, and diarrhoeic faeces which became blood-tinged in three days; the symptoms then abated; the faeces became normal in eight days after the onset of the disease and the buccal lesions healed in ten days. In the case of the former camel the symptoms were of the same nature but somewhat less pronounced. In the case of the third (the 12 year old camel) mild symptoms of the same kind were also observed. The two calves which acted as controls showed only a temperature reaction and loss of appetite." The only conclusions to be drawn from the above are that camels develop severe lesions of rinderpest and are more susceptible than some cattle to rinderpest." The results are stated to confirm the observations of PETROWSKY (Wiedornikow) on Steppe camels.																					CABI:19196300080

Administration Report of the Mysore Serum Institute for the Year 1937-38 with the Government Review Thereon.								38 pp.	38 pp.						1939	1939	STAFF.-The veterinary staff consisted of the director and six veterinary inspectors.GENERAL.-The demand for the products of the Institute increased and their sale effected a net profit of Rs. 70, 000. Work to improve the quality and variety of production is described, and investigation as to the extended use of the products in the field is discussed. It was shown that the simultaneous inoculation of anti-rinderpest, anti-haemorrhagic septicaemia and anti-blackleg sera did not affect the potency of the first named: goat rinderpest virus injected with haemorrhagic septicaemia vaccine and blackleg bacterin remained effective.Research was carried out on RINDERPEST, HAEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA, BLACKLEG, SHEEP Pox and FOWL CHOLERA. The bovine strain of rinderpest virus was passaged through 41 buffalo bull calves during the year without alteration in virulence, and a goat-adapted rinderpest virus was passaged through 101 goats without change. Goat virus was found to cause rather severe reactions in sheep. An attempt to test the potency of sheep-pox vaccine on rabbits and g. pigs gave unsatisfactory results. It was found that lambs born of ewes immune to sheep pox possessed a passive immunity which waned after 6-7 months. A formolized vaccine against fowl cholera was found to be superior to carbolized or heat-killed vaccine.SCIENTIFIC SECTION [RAO, K. R,]-Samples of johnin and avian tuberculin were prepared and tested on 20 animals artificially infected with JOHNE'S DISEASE. The johnin proved much more reliable than the avian tuberculin for diagnosis as checked by P.M. examination. Attempts made to transmit the disease to rabbits, g. pigs, rats, and poultry were unsuccessful. It was set up only in sheep and goats after a period of 4-6 months. It is claimed that chaulmoogra oil gave good results in the treatment of Johne's disease. Notes are also given on other diagnostic and therapeutic work.RESEARCH SECTION [NAIDU, P. M. N.]-A list is given of 12 disease conditions investigated, of which the following are noteworthy. An acute outbreak of COCCIDIOSIS in cattle caused the loss of 40% of adults and 100% of calves. An apparent failure of goat virus immunization against RINDERPEST is being investigated. Research on the aetiology of CONTAGIOUS PLEURO-PNEUMONIA of goats was undertaken but not completed. Some South African merino sheep imported for breeding contracted HEARTWATER soon after arriving and 6 out of 12 died. The type of RABIES in dogs in Mysore is described. It is practically always of the "dumb" type. Twenty-eight out of 39 dogs' brains examined were positive for rabies. Notes are given on POULTRY DISEASES in Mysore.NAIDU also reports his work on anthrax (saponin) vaccine, strangles vaccine, spleen tissue rinderpest vaccine and anti-rabic vaccines. A preventive rabie vaccine for dogs was made according to Finzi's method and was used on 45 dogs by single dose inoculation after being tested on rabbits. A modified vaccine of the above type was also prepared and tested for use as a curative vaccine for animals. A course of six doses is used for large animals and three doses for dogs. Thirty-four dogs, 1 sheep and 15 cattle were so treated and none contracted rabies.-G. WILLIAMSON.																					CABI:19412201145

Agrarnyy nauchnyy zhurnal					12			62	65		10.28983/ashy2020i12pp62-65				2020	2020	The dynamics of the most indicative markers of humoral immunity of BLV-infected rats and their offspring are presented in the article. The obtained data indicate that in experimentally infected rats, the immunological reaction develops mainly according to the inhibition principle. The IL-IRA content significantly exceeds the control group data (2 times). this is especially pronounced in the rats offspring (4.7 times). with a relatively stable 1L-13 content. In all experimental animals. the complement system is activated along the classical path: C4 fraction content increases by 14-18%. In BLV-infected rats. proteolytic complement fragments predominate: C3a (14-17%) and CSa (from 14% to 7 times) compared with the control group. It indicates the development of allergy and may be a marker of the tendency of tumor cells to proliferate. The results of our research create the prerequisites for the further use of laboratory rats in the study of immunogenesis of enzootic leukemia in cattle.																					CABI:20210071783

So far, plans for 15 parts of volume 16, which is on the experimental production of diseases, have been announced; part 9 is the second part to be published, part 7 (on the central nervous system) having appeared in 1962 [see V.B. 33, abst. 3007]. In part 9, the first of three parts to be devoted to the experimental production of infections, there are four reviews. That on experimental helminth infections in .lab. animals, by A. Erhardt, G. Lammler, E, Hinz and H. Themann, is restricted to helminths affecting man, though of course many of these are also of great veterinary interest: Fasciola hepatica, Dicrocoelium dendriticum, Trichinella spiralis, hookworms, ascarids, and filarial worms. In a review on experimental infections with pathogenic protozoa by G. Piekarski and C. Meske, trypanosome (T. gambiense, T. rhodesiense, T. cruzi), leishmania, plasmodium, coccidia and balantidium infections are considered. A review on experimental virus infections by W. Klone is mainly concerned with the techniques of culturing viruses in lab. animals, embryonated eggs, and tissue cultures. Experimental infections with tubercle bacilli, by W.-H. Wagner, reviews human, avian and bovine type infections in lab. animals.

One of these is also the cause of a disease in bovines, which is termed " giahan " and the other which is common to the ox. horse and sheep is responsible for the disease known as atteh, " and belongs to the surra group of trypanosomes.The trypanosomes are distinguishable by the following characters: -"Giahan" is transmitted by Stomoxys, while " atteh" is transmitted by Tabanidae. The two organisms are morphologically distinguishable. That causing "giahan" appears to be dimorphic, as it is said that young forms measure from 14 to 16 microns and adult forms 24 microns including the flagellum. The parasite of " atteh " measures about 30 microns excluding the flagellum, which measures about 8 microns. The parasite of " giahan " is not pathogenic for the dog, rabbit, mouse, whilst that causing "atteh" is pathogenic for these animals. The parasite of "atteh" has little or no pathogenic power for the adult ox and the sheep, while that of " giahan " is markedly pathogenic for these animals.																					CABI:19126300491

Two fatal adverse events temporally associated with YF vaccination were reported. Both cases had features similar to yellow fever disease, including hepatitis and multiorgan failure. Two different lots of YF 17DD virus vaccine were administered to the affected patients and also to hundreds of thousands of other individuals without any other reported serious adverse events. The lots were prepared from the secondary seed, which has been in continuous use since 1984. Nucleotide sequencing revealed minor variations at some nucleotide positions between the secondary seed lot virus and the virus isolates from patients; these differences were not consistent across the isolates, represented differences in the relative amount of each nucleotide in a heterogeneous position, and did not result in amino acid substitutions. Inoculation of rhesus monkeys with the viruses isolated from the two patients by the intracerebral (ic) or intrahepatic (ih) route caused minimal viremia and no clinical signs of infection or alterations in laboratory markers. Central nervous system histological scores of rhesus monkeys inoculated ic were within the expected range, and there were no histopathological lesions in animals inoculated ih. Altogether, these results demonstrated the genetic stability and attenuated phenotype of the viruses that caused fatal illness in the two patients. Therefore, the fatal adverse events experienced by the vaccinees are related to individual, genetically determined host factors that regulate cellular susceptibility to yellow fever virus. Such increased susceptibility, resulting in clinically overt disease expression, appears to be extremely rare. (C) 2001 Academic Press.																					WOS:000172753500014	11883195

However, little information is available regarding the combination of SeV-mediated gene and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy in dealing with ischemic diseases. In this study, we infected SeV to the MSCs in vitro; and injected MSCs modified with SeV harboring human angiopoietin-1 gene (SeVhAng-1) into the ischemic limb of rats in vivo. We found SeV had high transductive efficiency to the MSCs. Both MSCs and SeVhAng-1-modified MSCs improved the blood flow recovery and increased the capillary density of the ischemic limb, compared with the control. However, in contrast to MSCs, SeVhAng-1-modified MSCs had a better improvement of blood flow recovery in the ischemic limb. We further found the ischemic limb injected with SeVhAng-1-modified MSCs had strong expression of p-Akt, which improved survival of MSCs injected into the ischemic limb. This indicated SeVhAng-1 modification enhanced angiogenetic effect of MSCs by both angiogenesis and cell protection. We conclude that SeVhAng-1-modified MSCs may serve as a more effective tool in dealing with ischemic limb disease.																					WOS:000281976900001	20458615

Metabolically favorable remodeling of human adipose tissue by human adenovirus type 36								DIABETES				57	9			2321	2331		10.2337/db07-1311				SEP 2008	2008	OBJECTIVE-Experimental infection of rat's with human adenovirus type 36 (Ad-36) promotes adipogenesis and improves insulin sensitivity in a manner reminiscent of the pharmacologic effect of thiozolinediones. To exploit the potential of the viral proteins as a therapeutic target, for treating insulin resistance, this study investigated the ability of Ad-36 to induce metabolically favorable changes in human adipose tissue.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We determined whether Ad-36 increases glucose uptake in human adipose tissue explants. Cell-signaling pathways targeted by Ad-36 to increase glucose uptake were determined in the explants mid human adipose-derived stein cells. Ad-2, a nonadipogenic human adenovirus, was used as a negative control. As a proof of concept, nondiabetic and diabetic subjects were screened for the presence of Ad-36 antibodies to ascertain if natural Ad-36 infection predicted improved glycemic control.RESULTS-Ad-36 increased glucose uptake by adipose tissue explants obtained from nondiabetic and diabetic subjects. Without insulin stimulation, Ad-36 upregulated expressions of several proadipogenic genes, adiponectin, and fatty acid synthase and reduced the expression of inflammatory cytokine macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 in a phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent manner. In turn, the activation of PI3K by Ad-36 was independent of insulin receptor signaling but dependent on Ras signaling recruited by Ad-36. Ad-2 was nonadipogenic and did not increase glucose uptake. Natural Ad-36 infection in nondiabetic and diabetic subjects was associated with significantly lower fasting glucose levels and A1C, respectively.CONCLUSIONS-Ad-36 proteins may provide novel therapeutic targets that remodel human adipose tissue to a more metabolically favorable profile.

J	SCHUURMAN, C. J.; HUININK, A. M. SCHUURMAN-TEN BOKKEL								A study of the epidemiology of plague in West-Java, specially with a view to a possible share of the musk shrew								MEDEDEEL DIENST VOLKSGEZONDHEID NEDERLANDSCH INDIE				19	(3)			431	546						1931	1931	This study casts damaging reflexions on Crocidura coerulea as a participator in the diffusion of plague. In 87 villages or village-complexes in the Cheribon Presidency systematic catches were made by setting traps. In general only Rattus rattus griseiventer (R. r. diardii) and C. coerulea were caught in considerable numbers; in Cheribon, moreover, R. r. concolor. The density of house-rat and musk-shrew population, which are almost the same, was highest in the 24 villages on the main roads; lower in the 26 on the secondary roads; and lowest in those on the footpaths. Calculated by groups, this density was proportional to the number of units of admittance to the villages. In a village these densities are subject to rapid changes. All these facts are readily explained by the active migration of these animals. Indeed, it was proved that musk shrews and house rats wander along the roads, the former at least up to 500 m. and the latter to 900 m. from the houses. Musk shrews also reach other villages, as appears from recaptured specimens with punched ears. In woods and ricefields musk shrews and house rats are much less frequently caught at some distance from the houses than along the roads. Other suspicious facts observed about Croddura are that it nests about the houses in proximity to house rats; that the nests of the 2 are equally infested with Xenopsylla cheopis; and that its flea-index is as high as and often higher than, that of the house rat. Furthermore, rat fleas may remain infectious on a musk shrew for 4 days, so that even if it were insusceptible it might still pass its infective fleas to a house rat in another village. But it was proved that C. coerulea is not immune; a number caught alive died of plague in their cages. In cases of experimental infection, some died and in others the virus remained active in the spleen for at least 17 days. The X. cheopis-indexes of house rats and musk shrews showed a distinct correlation with monthly numbers of plague cases in the subdistrict Koeningan; in the musk shrew they even showed an accurate parallel 6 to plague mortality in the whole area investigated. The coastal regions investigated were characterized by a relatively high rat and musk-shrew density, with proportionally low total flea index. This might be one of the factors explaining the relative coastal immunity to plague in Java. Together with Xenopsylla astia, X. cheopis was found in all kampongs of Cheribon in much greater number, so that the expectation of this coastal immunity being due to the absence of X. cheopis or to the prevalence of X. astia finds no support in these data. Since the musk shrew in the kampongs about the harbor grounds considerably surpassed R. r. diardii in numbers and R. r. concolor in flea-index, as much attention should be bestowed on the former animal as on the rat spp., in a study of the importance of harbor grounds as a place of import of plague virus. It seems apparent that the chance for plague-infected fleas to travel from one village to another on musk shrews is certainly not less than that of infection along the road by rice transport. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: C.

April, 1950 to March, 1951.								63 pp.	63 pp.						1953	1953	In the virus research section (pp. 7-15) of the 1950-1 report [cf. R.A.M., 31, p. 231] it is stated that two new strains of cacao swollen shoot virus [31, p. 427 and above, p. 215] were found. At Saalman in the Akim Abuakwa district, Gold Coast, the leaf symptoms of one strain were confined to one half of the leaf and appeared as a yellow mottle covering almost all that half and tending to form a false sickle-leaf. The other strain was found at Tepa, Ashanti, in an outbreak affecting only 30 to 40 trees, 40 miles from any other known outbreak. The virus was confined to the leaves, the young flushes displaying a red mottle between the lateral veins, and the mature leaves a flecking of the tertiary veins. The symptoms often affected one half of the lamina only.Whereas in August, 1945, only 31 per cent. of the trees on the 8 1/2 acre experimental plot were affected by virus 1A [31, p. 427], by March, 1951, the figure had risen to 92.2 per cent., the yield decreasing during the same period from 8.75 to 1.2 loads per acre.In the experiment to determine whether infection of trees with a mild strain of 1A renders them immune from subsequent attack by a virulent strain of the same complex [31, p. 231] the number of controls showing virulent infection greatly increased, though the spread of virulent virus infection into plots given prior infection with mild virus was retarded. Transmission of the virulent virus from trees previously infected with mild virus was obtained when only one vector was used as the transmitting agent. In 1951-2 the virulent strain was obtained more frequently than the mild.In tests of the host range of the cacao viruses [loc. cit. ; 31, p. 232] it was proved that Corchorus tridens is susceptible to virus 1A and was killed by it, though it did not appear to be infected by other strains. Pterygota macrocarpa also was susceptible to virus 1A only.In the section on mycology (pp. 37-40) it is reported that as in previous years, while incidence of pod diseases, particularly black pod (Phytophthora palmivora) [see next abstract and above, p. 215], was reduced by fungicidal spraying, no treatment affected the mean weight of wet beans per pod, though the total harvests from the control and Bordeaux-treated plots were significantly lower than those from plots given other treatments. In the controls cankered cushions were much more numerous than in the other plots, and were non-productive. In the Bordeaux plots loss of crop appeared to be due to poor set resulting from the burning of the blossoms by the spray. Considerable control of primary infection was given by perenox (mean per cent. of black pod 6.8) and Bordeaux (8.13); D.D.T., weekly harvesting, and control plots had, respectively, 10.78, 12.25, and 13.94 per cent.In the second report (virus research section pp. 7-8) it is stated that a new strain of cacao swollen shoot virus was collected from the Wenchi-Techiman area of Ashanti; it displayed symptoms resembling those of Bosomuosu 2 (Western Province); another from Okerikrom-Dormaa (Ashanti) produced a light green mottle along the primary and secondary veins with swellings on the chupons.Tests with the severe strain of virus 1A on Triplochiton scleroxylon, Cistanthera papaverifera Desplatzia lutea, Cola nitida, Hibiscus esculentus[Abelmoschus esculentus], Gossypium spp., and Xanthosoma spp. were again negative, as were first tests on cassava, Abutilon asiaticum, Datura stramonium, Ricinodendron africanum, chilli (Capsicum annuum), and a wide range of forest trees, some with virus-like symptoms. Corchorus tridens is frequently infected but symptomless. Two Bombax buonopozense seedlings experimentally infected in 1948 with the Offa Igbo strain [29, p. 608] of swollen shoot virus have, since March, 1951, given positive results when tested at intervals of two months. All previous attempts had failed, in spite of repeated coppicing. The symptoms expressed in the cacao test plants became more intense at each subsequent back-test.In the section on mycology (pp. 27-28) it is stated that records of pod disease investigations show that about 10 per cent. of the potential cacao harvest has to be discarded, rather more than half this loss being due to damage by P. palmivora. Rodent injury can account for 25 per cent. and other factors for approximately 2 1/2 per cent.In the section on arboricides (pp. 32-36) experimental results are reported, demonstrating that cacao trees can be killed with certain chemicals either by treating the standing tree or by stump treatment after felling. For forest trees formulations of the n-butyl and isopropyl esters of 2, 4-D and 2, 4, 5-T in a number of instances have given a kill. Further treatments are progressing.

When inoculated intraperitoneally, passively immunized mice remained healthy, whereas mice to which no antibody was given developed well-defined symptoms of tick-borne encephalitis after injection either of the RNA or intact virus. The negative results of clinical observations on immune mice, confirmed by pathohistological investigations, testified against a direct involvement of infectious RNA in the central nervous system lesions developing after peripheral routes of infection. The data obtained suggest that after a peripheral inoculation of tick-borne encephalitis virus RNA, an important step in the infectious process is the formation of complete virus at the site of RNA inoculation; the further development of the infectious process is due to this virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19644500006866

J	COVELL, G.; MEHTA, D. R.								Studies on Typhus in the Simla Hills. Part VI. The Role of the Human Body-louse in the Transmission of Typhus.								Indian Journal of Medical Research				24	2			389	397						1936, October	1936	It has been suggested that the transmission of typhus from man to man by means of Pediculus humanus, L., may explain the epidemics that occur from time to time in the Simla Hills area [cf. R.A.E., B 24 105], and the experiments here described were designed to throw light on this question.The following is mainly taken from the authors' summary: Attempts were made to transmit a strain of typhus, originally derived from the brains of wild rats, from monkey to monkey by means of the human body-louse. The technique of feeding and dissecting the lice is described. Of 60 lice fed on experimentally infected monkeys, 3 showed enormous numbers of bipolar-staining rickettsiae in smears from the mid-gut. Of 3 monkeys on which lice from the infected batch were allowed to feed, one developed a febrile reaction and another a slight rise in agglutinins for Proteus OX 19. A guineapig Subpassaged from the former animal gave a febrile reaction but no scrotal reaction. Lice that had died during the experiment were rubbed into the scarified skin of a fourth monkey, which developed a febrile reaction, together with a slight rise in agglutinins for Proteus OX 19. Guineapigs subpassaged from this animal have shown pyrexia, but no scrotal reaction.Although the attempt to infect lice was successful, the results of the experiments on the transmission of the virus from monkey to monkey by means of lice are considered to be inconclusive.

On the 4th day from 1st feeding, serum from all 3 was Weil-Felix positive at 1:30-1:50, and later showed a higher titer; the reaction remained positive for about 3 wks. after lice were removed. The infection was entirely symptom-free and afebrile. Virus from such carriers infected mice (8 passages), but was less stable than the usual passage virus and unsuited to unlimited passage. The bite of healthy lice did not induce a positive Weil-Felix reaction. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: M. C. J																					BCI:BCI19340800011353

III								ANN INST PASTEUR [PARIS]				45	(4)			457	523						1930	1930	Monkeys (Macacus rhesus) proved very sensitive to enzootic encephalomyelitis when snb-durally inoculated. Incubation period and course varied according to the individual, but death always supervened in about 70 days. Contrary to Zwick's conclusions, chickens seemed refractory to subdural inoculations. Guinea pigs, infected cerebrally, may die of the disease very late. Cats were not sensitive to the intra-cerebrally injected virus. Dogs subdurally inoculated were refractory, though the virus remained in the brain a long time. Rabbits proved sensitive to intramuscular inoculation; of 8 given the virus by way of the gastric tract, only 1 died. Infection by contact is possible. Inoculation of the popliteal and inguinal ganglia does not generally infect nor does it lead to death. During the study of rabbits some cases of "autosterilized" neuro-infections were encountered; they may lead either to immunity (generally) or to death, according to location and extent of lesions. It is possible that this "autosterilization" may be in some cases only apparent, owing to disguise of the virus by antibodies. Joest-Degen bodies frequently appear degenerated or in process of resorption in nerve tissue deprived of virus (fatal or non-fatal "autosterilization"). In the brain of animals dying of Borna's disease, the effect on the microglia was shown by hypertrophy, hyperplasia, mobilization and metamorphosis. Alterations of the mesoglia were greater here than in other infections with a neurotropic virus, since the incubation period and duration of the disease were longer. It was difficult to immunize experimental animals; intracutaneous inoculation did not produce immunization, and repeated intramuscular or intracerebral injection frequently produced a refractory condition. A single, intramuscular injection of 1 cc. of the virus, attenuated for 79 days by carbolized glycerine, produced immunity in rabbits against intracerebral inoculation. It was possible to show, in vitro, virulicidal antibodies in the brain and suprarenal capsule of immunized rabbits, but not in the serum. Complement fixation showed evidence of sen-sitization in serum as well as in organ extracts. The antibodies apparently arose in the tissues involved by the virus, whence they entered the circulation. Specificity of sensitization was not strict, for positive results occurred, though in less intensity, with antigens of herpes, rabies, etc. Experiments in crossed immunity between equine, bovine, and sheep enzootic encephalo-myelitic strains show them to be identical. There is no crossed immunity between the virus of Borna's disease and that of acute anterior poliomyelitis. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: -From authors' summary (transl.)

Indian Journal of Veterinary Science				4				862	896						1934	1934	This article records an investigation into the nature of bovine trypanosomiasis in southern India. The smaller trypanosome occurring in cattle was identified as Tryp. evansi, and the parasite of the ox appeared to be identical with that of the horse and dog, the average length of the organism in all these animals being 25mu. In white rats the average length was increased to 80mu. Strains of the trypanosome from dogs appeared to be more virulent than those from cattle or horses. Rats immunized against surra, by infection followed by treatment with " Bayer 205 ", proved immune to bovine or equine strains but, in some cases, reinfection was obtained with dog strains and with strains which had developed exceptional virulence during passage through guineapigs. This enhancement of virulence in guineapigs was a temporary phenomenon which disappeared in succeeding passages.In cattle, experimental infection caused a mild type of disease with scanty trypanosomes in the peripheral blood which was only infective to laboratory animals in large doses (over 2 c.c.). After a few months the blood ceased to be infective, but red cell adhesion tests continued to give positive readings.Some doubt is thrown on the possibility of cattle acting as a reservoir for the trypanosome sufficiently long to maintain the disease over the non-surra season, and an examination of calves used for rinderpest virus, which might be expected to cause a flare-up of trypanosomiasis, only revealed trypanosome infections during the surra season. Some investigation into the role of species of Tabanus as transmitting agents was undertaken, and doubt is expressed as to their importance in this connection.One case of T. theileri infection in a bull of the Madras Corporation is recorded, the animal dying after exhibiting symptoms similar to those of piroplasmosis. -U.

TBE infection was asymptomatic and nonlethal in all voles. The virus was eliminated from the voles between days 14 and 60 postinoculation. Only 1 of 26 tested animals produced anti-TBE antibodies in titer 1:20. RV infection was acute and lethal. All sick animals contained RV in the brain, 42.1% in salivary glands, 5.3% in the lungs and kidneys. The voles which survived RV inoculation had no RV. The voles inoculated with RV after TBE were less sensitive and had a longer incubation period in comparison with the animals challenged with RV alone. The differences augmented from day 0 to day 14 after TBE inoculation and became statistically significant on day 14. Later, 21 day after challenge with TBE virus, the differences almost disappeared. The role of possible interference in the evolution of virus-host interaction of Lyssaviruses is discussed.																					BCI:BCI200200226974	11852779

LPB neurons then project to the capsular part of the central amygdala (CeA; CeC), a key structure underlying the nociception-emotion link. LPB-CeC synaptic transmission is enhanced in various pain models by using electrical stimulation of putative fibers of LPB origin in brain slices. However, this approach has limitations for examining direct monosynaptic connections devoid of directly stimulating fibers from other structures and local GABAergic neurons. To overcome these limitations, we infected the LPB of rats with an adeno-associated virus vector expressing channelrhodopsin-2 and prepared coronal and horizontal brain slices containing the amygdala. We found that blue light stimulation resulted in monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), with very small latency fluctuations, followed by a large polysynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic current in CeC neurons, regardless of the firing pattern type. Intraplantar formalin injection at 24 h before slice preparation significantly increased EPSC amplitude in late firing-type CeC neurons. These results indicate that direct monosynaptic glutamatergic inputs from the LPB not only excite CeC neurons but also regulate CeA network signaling through robust feed-forward inhibition, which is under plastic modulation in response to persistent inflammatory pain.

Zika virus infection at mid-gestation results in fetal cerebral cortical injury and fetal death in the olive baboon								PLOS PATHOGENS				15	1					e1007507	10.1371/journal.ppat.1007507				JAN 2019	2019	Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy in humans is associated with an increased incidence of congenital anomalies including microcephaly as well as fetal death and miscarriage and collectively has been referred to as Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS). Animal models for ZIKV infection in pregnancy have been developed including mice and non-human primates (NHPs). In macaques, fetal CZS outcomes from maternal ZIKV infection range from none to significant. In the present study we develop the olive baboon (Papio anubis), as a model for vertical transfer of ZIKV during pregnancy. Four mid-gestation, timed-pregnant baboons were inoculated with the French Polynesian ZIKV isolate (10(4) ffu). This study specifically focused on the acute phase of vertical transfer. Dams were terminated at 7 days post infection (dpi; n = 1), 14 dpi (n = 2) and 21 dpi (n = 1). All dams exhibited mild to moderate rash and conjunctivitis. Viremia peaked at 5-7 dpi with only one of three dams remaining mildly viremic at 14 dpi. An anti-ZIKV IgM response was observed by 14 dpi in all three dams studied to this stage, and two dams developed a neutralizing IgG response by either 14 dpi or 21 dpi, the latter included transfer of the IgG to the fetus (cord blood). A systemic inflammatory response (increased IL2, IL6, IL7, IL15, IL16) was observed in three of four dams. Vertical transfer of ZIKV to the placenta was observed in three pregnancies (n = 2 at 14 dpi and n = 1 at 21 dpi) and ZIKV was detected in fetal tissues in two pregnancies: one associated with fetal death at 14 dpi, and the other in a viable fetus at 21 dpi. ZIKV RNA was detected in the fetal cerebral cortex and other tissues of both of these fetuses. In the fetus studied at 21 dpi with vertical transfer of virus to the CNS, the frontal cerebral cortex exhibited notable defects in radial glia, radial glial fibers, disorganized migration of immature neurons to the cortical layers, and signs of pathology in immature oligodendrocytes. In addition, indices of pronounced neuroinflammation were observed including astrogliosis, increased microglia and IL6 expression. Of interest, in one fetus examined at 14 dpi without detection of ZIKV RNA in brain and other fetal tissues, increased neuroinflammation (IL6 and microglia) was observed in the cortex. Although the placenta of the 14 dpi dam with fetal death showed considerable pathology, only minor pathology was noted in the other three placentas. ZIKV was detected immunohistochemically in two placentas (14 dpi) and one placenta at 21 dpi but not at 7 dpi. This is the first study to examine the early events of vertical transfer of ZIKV in a NHP infected at mid-gestation. The baboon thus represents an additional NHP as a model for ZIKV induced brain pathologies to contrast and compare to humans as well as other NHPs.Author summary Zika virus is endemic in the Americas, primarily spread through mosquitos and sexual contact. Zika virus infection during pregnancy in women is associated with a variety of fetal pathologies now referred to as Congenital Zika Syndrome (CZS), with the most severe pathology being fetal microcephaly. Developing model organisms that faithfully recreate Zika infection in humans is critical for future development of treatments and preventions. In our present study, we infected Olive baboons at mid-gestation with Zika virus and studied the acute period of viremia and transfer of Zika virus to the fetus during the first three weeks after infection to better understand the timing and mechanisms of transfer of ZIKV across the placenta, leading to CZS. We observed Zika virus transfer to fetuses resulting in fetal death in one pregnancy and in a second pregnancy, significant damage to the frontal cortex of the fetal brain at a critical period of neurodevelopment in primates. Thus, the baboon provides a promising new non-human primate model to further compare and contrast the consequences of Zika virus infection in pregnancy to humans and other non-human primates.

J	HAGAN, W. A.		U.S.A. NEW YORK.						Report of the New York State Veterinary College at Cornell university for the year 1944-1945.								Report of the New York State Veterinary College at Cornell university for the year 1944-1945.								205	205						1946	1946	By continuous teaching, without any summer breaks, the college succeeded in graduating two extra classes during 1942-45: this seriously affected the amount of research done during these years. Students were unable to devote any time to seeing practice and this adversely affected the efficiency of graduates. The course has now been revised to throw more emphasis on clinical instruction, students being required to take full charge of cases. A four weeks' refresher course for demobilized veterinarians has been added to the existing informal post-graduate course. There has been close collaboration with the Extension Service of the College of Agriculture in winter extension schools. About 25000 farm animals were treated in the ambulatory and consulting clinics, the number of dairy cows exceeding all other species combined. More than 4000 domestic pets were treated in the Small Animals' Clinic and 1600 outbreaks of disease were investigated in the poultry clinic.The college library now contains 17, 000 books and 141 periodicals are currently received.Feeding infected milk to calves which were allowed to suck each other did not produce MASTITIS, neither did it confer any immunity to the disease. The Hotis test, supplemented by stained films from incubated milk samples offered a simple and fairly accurate check on results of physical examination of udders, but use of blood agar plates was better when time and facilities permitted. Penicillin gave promising results as a cure for MASTITIS. A two-year survey of milch cows showed that the incidence of MASTITIS was correlated directly with milk production. Of the 719 cows in the survey 163 became infected withStr. agalactiaeand 133 with staphylococci. Since neither tuberculin nor the serological test are specific for TUBERCULOSIS it is considered that the practice of regarding all tuberculin reactors as affected will have to be abandoned; otherwise reactors will continue to be found after the disease has been eradicated. Of blood samples from 14, 000 turkeys tested for PULLORUM DISEASE, 251 were positive, and 55 were " suspicious ". Eight years' work on calfhood vaccination withBr. abortusstrain 19 showed that the abortion rate in controls was 18 68%, as against 4.46% in vaccinated animals and that the height of the blood titre following vaccination was not a reliable criterion on which to predict immunity. Reactions which persisted after vaccination were due to infection with virulent field strains, rather than to persistence of strain 19. A significant break in immunity occurred in the fourth pregnancy in animals which had been vaccinated as calves. In naturally occurring BOVINE CONTAGIOUS ABORTION, a high opsonic index did not indicate immunity to abortion, and there was no obvious quantitative relation between the opsonic and agglutinin contents of the blood of a given cow.It appeared that effective immunity was not based upon the presence of opsonins, as cows which had been exposed to severe natural infection for years without contracting the disease sometimes had a low opsonic titre. Streptomycin prevented, but did not cure, artificial infection of g. pigs with Br. abortus. Cheese made from milk naturally infected with Br. abortus contained no viable organisms after a ripening period of three months.During the early years of the college, the diagnostic laboratories received only a few hundred specimens per year, now, however, approximately 200, 000 specimens are examined yearly. During 1944-45, of 477 heads from dogs suspected of RABIES, 46, in which Negri bodies were not found, proved to be positive upon inoculation of Swiss mice. It is suggested that the use of rabies vaccine militates against the formation of Negri bodies. A disease of cattle, which may have been BOVINE MALIGNANT CATARRH was investigated without obtaining positive results. NEWCASTLE DISEASE was diagnosed in New York State for the first time, although it had been recognised in the U.S.A. two years previously. Ultra-violet irradiation did not prevent air-borne infection from adult birds artificially infected with the virus of INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS of chicks to susceptible birds. An acute infective disease which caused a 5-10% mortality in ducklings was investigated, but no causative agent had been identified. Sulphaquinoxaline was ineffective when used to treat birds naturally and artificially infected with FOWL CORYZA.Heavy losses in feeding lambs had hitherto been thought mainly due to HELMINTHIASIS, but a year's study of the industry indicated that this was not so. A metal oesophageal tube was shown to be a satisfactory method of dosing sheep with anthelmintics.Extensive studies of the cause and prevention of AVIAN LEUKOSIS were being carried out. A chorionic gonadotropin, follutein (Squibb), derived from the urine of pregnant mares, gave excellent results in the treatment of 16 cases of CYSTIC OVARY in cows. Trade products which are claimed to " energize " spermatozoa have beert used without success. Work designed to investigate the value of vitamin A therapy in cases of BOVINE KETOSIS gave negative results. Total pancreatectomy in two calves produced mild DIABETES. Fatal cases of UREA POISONING were diagnosed in dairy cattle after a ready mixed ration purporting to contain 3% of the protein in the form of urea had been fed. As a result of inefficient mixing, some bags of the feed contained 15-20% of the nitrogen in the form of urea.-G. B. S. HEATH.																					CABI:19472201908

B	BISSERU, B.								Diseases of man acquired from his pets.								Diseases of man acquired from his pets								xiv + 482 pp.	xiv + 482 pp.						1968	1968	Bisseru has used the intimate relationship between man and his pet animals as a justification for writing a 482-page book, but the title is misleading as the role of a wide range of animals in spreading human disease is discussed. This book is essentially for practitioners and students of both human and veterinary medicine and for those interested in animal care but it is not intended for use by research workers. The first 8 chapters 'are on carnivores, birds, rodents, non-human primates, ungulates, reptiles and amphibians, fish (including other marine animals) and arthropods. Viral, bacterial, rickettsial, spirochaetal, fungal, protozoan, and helminthic diseases, as well as diseases of arthropod origin are covered. There are many photomicrographs and illustrations including diagrammatic representation of the life-cycles of some of the organisms mentioned. At the end of each chapter there is a small list of articles and books under the heading of "Further reading", but no reference is made in the text to the literature cited. The ninth chapter contains a table listing human infections presumably acquired from animals and deals with the organism, the method of human infection, the geographical distribution and the animals involved. This is a long list of organisms and the 127 helminths include even those in which the only record of hximan involvement is experimental infection. The reviewer was rather disappointed with this book. The author has not defined its scope and its value is diminished by what appears to be irrelevant and unnecessary information, for example, the effect of alcohol and birthday parties for pets, the effect of selective breeding, pets as status symbols etc. and the effect of hair sprays (lacquer) on cage-birds and fish in aquaria. There are several factual errors in the the helminth sections including: Clinostomum complanatum, described on page 103 as a nematode offish, is a trernatode parasitizing birds with a larval stage in fish; Eustoma rotundatum is described as the cause of eosinophilic grarmlomata of the human intestinal tract following eating herrings (page 415) although these nematodes were correctly identified in 1962 as Anoakis sp. larvae; Anisakis sp. is also wrongly described as being parasitic in elasmo-branchs whereas all species of this genus are confined to marine mammals. Errors of this type detract very considerably from the usefulness of this book. A serious omission is the lack of information on epidemiology. L.F.K.																					CABI:19700801243

Detection rate of the TBEV RNA and antigen E remained high during the whole period of observations; however, virus pathogenic for laboratory suckling mice was isolated mainly during a period of 8 days post infection. At the late stages of the persistent infection (1-4 months) the TBEV RNA detection rate in northern red-backed voles and laboratory mice remained high, whereas in striped field mice it significantly declined (p < 0.001). The viral loads were significantly higher (p < 0.001) in the wild rodents compared to the laboratory mice. Average frequencies of Th2 cytokine gene expression were similar for M. rutilus (50.0 +/- 8.5%) and A. agrarius (50.0 +/- 9.6%) during the whole period, but Th1 cytokine mRNA detection rate after transcription activation in 2 days post infection and subsequent return to the original values were different (22.2 +/- 5.0% and 38.1 +/- 7.6%, respectively (p > 0.05)). Meanwhile, a part of animals with interleukin 111 mRNA was significantly higher among A. agrarius than among M. rutilus (p < 0.05), which might cause low levels of spontaneous TBEV infection of field mice compared to red voles. Hemagglutination inhibition and virus-neutralizing antibodies were revealed in wild rodents in 30 days post infection and remained at detectable levels during 4 months.Thus, the TBEV persistence in small rodents was accompanied by the detection of the pathogenic virus in the early period, the viral RNA and antigen E during 4 months with high viral loads in wild animals exceeding the values in laboratory mice. Changes in the proinflammatory cytokine gene expression frequencies and the TBEV-specific antibodies pointed at immunomodulation as the possible mechanism of the TBEV persistence.

Peripheral nerve regeneration can be enhanced by the conduit which connects the both sides of transected nerve. The conduit maintains the effects of neurotrophism and BDNF produced by Schwann cells which can be made by gene therapy. In this study, we tried to enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration by using calcium phosphate coated porous conduit and BDNF-Adenovirus infected Schwann cells in sciatic nerve of rats.Materials and Methods: Microporous filter which permits the tissue fluid essential for nerve regeneration and does not permit infiltration of fibroblasts, was made into 2mm diameter and 17mm length conduit. Then it was coated with calcium phosphate to improve the Schwann cell adhesion and survival. The coated filter was evaluated by SEM examination and MTT assay.For effective allogenic Schwann cell culture, dorsal root ganglia of 1-day old rat were extracted and treated with enzyme and antimitotic Ara-C.Human BDNF cDNA was obtained from cDNA library and amplified using PCR. BDNF gene was inserted into adenovirus shuttle vector pAACCMVpARS in which E1 was deleted. We infected the BDNF-Ad into 293 human mammary kidney cell-line and obtained the virus plaque 2 days later. RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the secretion of BDNF in infected Schwann cells. To determine the most optimal m.o.i of BDNF-Ad, we infected the Schwann cells with LacZ adenovirus in 1, 20, 50, 75, 100, 250 m.o.i for 2 hours and stained with beta-galactosidase.Rats(n=24) weighing around 300g were used. Total 14mm sciatic nerve defect was made and connected with calcium phosphate coated conduits. Schwann cells(1x10(6)) or BDNF-Ad infected Schwann cells(1x10(6)) were injected in conduit and only media(MEM) was injected in control group.Twelve weeks after surgery, degree of nerve regeneration was evaluated with gait analysis, electrophysiologic measurements and histomorphometric analysis.Results:1. Microporous Millipore filter was effective conduit which permitted the adhesion of Schwann cells and inhibited the adhesion of fibroblast. We could enhance the Schwann cell adhesion and survival by coating Millipore filter with calcium phosphate.2. Schwann cell culture technique using repeated treatment of Ara-C and GDNF was established. The mean number of Schwann cells obtained 1 and 2 weeks after the culture were 1.54 +/- 4.0x10(6) and 9.66 +/- 9.6x10(6).3. The mRNA of BDNF in BDNF-Ad infected Schwann cells was detected using RT-PCR. In Schwann cell 0.69 mu g/mu l of DNA was detected and in BDNF-Adenovirus transfected Schwann cell 0.795 mu g/mu l of DNA was detected. The most effective infection concentration was determined by LacZ Adenovirus and 75 m.o.i was found the most optimal.Conclusion: BDNF-Ad transfected Schwann cells successfully regenerated the 14mm nerve gap which was connected with calcium phosphate coated Millipore filter. The BDNF-Ad group showed better results compared with Schwann cells only group and control group in aspect to sciatic function index, electrophysiologic measurements and histomorphometric analysis.

In this study we use a genetically restricted viral tracing strategy to definitively map their spatially diffuse connectome. We infected bulbospinal RVLM neurons with recombinant rabies variant that drives reporter expression in monosynaptically connected input neurons and mapped their distribution using a MRI-based volumetric atlas and a novel image alignment and visualization tool that efficiently translates the positions of neurons captured in conventional photomicrographs to Cartesian coordinates. We identified prominent inputs from well-established neurohumoral and viscero-sympathetic sensory actuators, medullary autonomic and respiratory subnuclei, and supramedullary autonomic nuclei. The majority of inputs lay within the brainstem (88 - 94%), and included putative respiratory neurons in the pre-Botzinger Complex and post-inspiratory complex that are therefore likely to underlie respiratory-sympathetic coupling. We also discovered a substantial and previously unrecognized input from the region immediately ventral to nucleus prepositus hypoglossi. In contrast, RVLM sympathetic premotor neurons were only sparsely innervated by suprapontine structures including the paraventricular nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, periaqueductal grey and superior colliculus, and we found almost no evidence of direct inputs from the cortex or amygdala. Our approach can be used to quantify, standardize and share complete neuroanatomical datasets, and therefore provides researchers with a platform for presentation, analysis and independent analysis of connectomic data.

Their formation turned to be of cyclic character, dose-dependent and closely related with the formation of all known mechanisms of specific and nonspecific cellular defense. The presentation pattern of viral antigens on the surface of these target-cells turned to be variable in the course of the infections evidenced their different recognition in the reactions with the participation of virospecific antibodies of effectory cells.

B	MOHLER, J. R.								Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 19[39-]40.								Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 19[39-]40.								90 pp.	90 pp.						1940	1940	As a result of the continuation of the campaign for the eradication of Itoophilus anmtlatus, Say, on cattle, horses and mules in the United States in 1939-40, the area remaining under Federal quarantine was reduced to 1 per cent, of its original size [cf. R.A.E., B 28 100], A table is given showing the progress made since the campaign began in 1906 and the position on 30th June 1940. Tick-infested deer remained the most troublesome aspect of the work in Florida. No infestation has been found for 15 months in the central part of the State from which the removal of deer was authorized in 1937, and satisfactory progress was made in one of the counties from which it was authorized in 1939, but in the other, opposition delayed the work. Reinfestation from stray animals from Mexico continued to occur in the lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and the construction of a fence along part of the international boundary is advocated by many. In Porto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where B. a. microplus, Can. (anstralis, Fuller) is prevalent, it was also necessary to treat the sheep and goats and a few deer on infested premises. The middle third of Porto Rico, covering 1, 247 sq. miles, was released from quarantine.In the course of studies on possible vectors of anaplasmosis of cattle, adults of Amblyomma maculatum, Koch, that had had infective meals as larvae and nymphs, Stomoxys calcitrans, L., and Psorophora columbine, D. & K., failed to transmit the disease either from carriers or from animals with clinical anaplasmosis to healthy ones. Continued experiments with washes consisting of 12 or 16 oz. derris or cube powder and 4 oz. soap in water to make one U.S. gal. scrubbed into the back and sides of cattle at about 1 U.S. pint per animal for the control of Hypoderma lineatum, Vill. [28 101] showed that derris and cube were equally effective. Powders containing 4 per cent, rotenone and used at 12 oz. per U.S. gal. were as effective as those containing 5 per cent, used at 16 oz. per U.S. gal. in killing larvae in situ, but less so against those that came up after the treatment had been applied. More than one treatment was usually necessary to eradicate the larvae. The treatment caused no injury to the cattle, even when the temperature was as low as 20 °F. Three applications of a bentonite-sulphur spray, one before the warble-flies were active and two during the period of activity, failed to prevent infestation. No symptoms of anaphylaxis and little swelling at the point of injection developed in calves into which a preparation made of freshly ground Hypoderma larvae was injected before they were exposed to infestation, and the calves developed no immunity. Of dairy cattle examined for demo-dectic mange [caused by Demodex bovis, Stiles] in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico and Illinois, from 15-1 to 24 per cent, were infested. Attempts to transfer the mite by direct contact, brushes and other implements, or the contents of infected nodules all failed. External applications that failed to control the mange when used as dips or sprays included an arsenical dip, a fused-bentonite-sulphur dip and a saturated solution of borax. Rotenone in oil or in acetone, applied directly to the lesions, and medication of the cattle with such products as dry irradiated yeast, cold-pressed wheat-germ oil and borax, were equally ineffective. Cattle lice were eradicated by a single treatment with derris powder.Observations on June beetles [Lachnosterna] as intermediate hosts of the thorn-headed worm of swine [Macracanthorhynchus hirudinaceus] indicated that the adult beetles can harbour about twice as many infective larvae as the grubs [cf. 28 101-102], though the presence of more than 35 such larvae usually results in the death of the beetle after two or three days. The beetles constitute a potential means of dissemination of the parasite and a danger to the pigs that swallow them.																					CABI:19411000218		
J	Goldman, DL; Khine, H; Abadi, J; Lindenberg, DJ; Pirofski, L; Niang, R; Casadevall, A								Serologic evidence for Cryptococcus neoformans infection in early childhood								PEDIATRICS				107	5					e66	10.1542/peds.107.5.e66				MAY 2001	2001	Objective. Cryptococcus neoformans is an important cause of central nervous system infection in adults with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but an unusual cause of disease in children with AIDS. The basis for this age-related difference in incidence is not known but may be caused by differences in exposure or immune response. The objective of this study was to determine whether the low prevalence of cryptococcal disease among children is related to a lack of exposure to C neoformans.Methods. Sera were obtained from 185 immunocompetent individuals ranging in age from 1 week to 21 years who were being evaluated in an urban emergency department. Sera were analyzed for antibodies to C neoformans and Candida albicans proteins by immunoblotting. Immunoblot patterns were compared with those obtained from sera of patients with cryptococcosis (n = 10) and workers in a laboratory devoted to the study of C neoformans. The specificity of our results was confirmed by several approaches, including antibody absorption and blocking studies. Sera were also analyzed for the presence of cryptococcal polysaccharide by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and latex agglutination assays.Results. Sera from children 1.1 to 2 years old demonstrated minimal reactivity to C neoformans proteins. In contrast, the majority of sera from children >2 years old recognized many (greater than or equal to6) C neoformans proteins. For children between 2.1 and 5 years old, 56% of sera (n = 25) reacted with many proteins, whereas for children >5 years old (n = 120), 70% of samples reacted with many proteins. Reactivity was decreased by absorbing sera with C neoformans extracts or by preincubating blots with sera from experimentally infected but not from control rats. Reactivity to C neoformans proteins did not correlate with reactivity to C albicans proteins, which was common in sera from children between the ages of 1.1 and 2 years. Cryptococcal polysaccharide was detected at a titer of 1:16 (similar to 10 ng/mL) in the sera of 1 child, a 5.6-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department with vomiting.Conclusions. Our findings provide both indirect and direct evidence of C neoformans infection in immunocompetent children. Our results indicate that C neoformans infects a majority of children living in the Bronx after 2 years old. These results are consistent with several observations: the ubiquitous nature of C neoformans in the environment, including its association with pigeon excreta; the large number of pigeons in urban areas; and the increased likelihood of environmental exposure for children once they have learned to walk. The signs and symptoms associated with C neoformans infection in immunocompetent children remained to be determined. Primary pulmonary cryptococcosis may be asymptomatic or produce symptoms confused with viral infections and, therefore, not recognized as a fungal infection. Our results suggest that the low incidence of symptomatic cryptococcal disease in children with AIDS is not a result of lack of exposure to C neoformans. These findings have important implications for C neoformans pathogenesis and the development of vaccine strategies.																					WOS:000168411100003	11331716

The main progress in research is discussed; the publica-tions of the staff are listed and the financial position is described.RESEARCHIn this report, for the first time, the results of work by the three newly constituted sections of pathology, serology and protozoology are set out separately.REPORT OF THE PATHOLOGY SECTION. [DATTA, S. C. A.]JOHNE'S DISEASE.-An attempt is being made to vaccinate new-born calves, [no details]. Spleen extract was used therapeutically on the experimental herds but it was also found that " definite cases of Johne's disease have shown marked retrogression. . . after .... two years at Muktesar without any form of treatment." Environment is thought to be important. An attempt to produce a specific bacteriophage gave negative results.TUBERCULOSIS.-Three strains of tubercle bacilli from local cattle were taken to England for study. The " Muktesar avian strain " has been losing virulence and attempts to exalt it by passage through fowls and bulls failed.BOVINE NASAL GRANULOMA.-This common disease was studied and the association of Schistosoma spindalis was confirmed. A detailed account was published elsewhere [this Bull. 3. 549].Antimosan was tested for chemothera-peutic value and the preliminary results warranted further work. Transmission by contact does not occur as normal cattle housed with affected cattle did not contract the disease; the maximum period of test was eight years.BOVINE ENZOOTIC HAEMATURIA.-Schistosome adults and ova were found in the urine of six clinical cases.CONGENITAL BLINDNESS IN CALVES.-An increasing number of cases occurs in different parts of India. Work along nutritional lines is desirable, but could not be started.PNEUMONIA.-Two strains of pasteurella are being studied: one has been identified with P. boviseptica. B. pseudotuberculosis rodentium [Past. pseudotubercu-losis] was isolated from a supposed case of miliary tuberculosis in a bull.BURSATI, STRANGLES, KUMRI.-Work was continued. A nematode was found in diseased skin tissue from cases of bursati.SHEEP AND GOAT DISEASES.- Schistosoma indicum was found in a nodular lesion of the small intestine of a sheep. A condition similar to or identical with contagious ecthyma of goats was encountered.CANINE DISEASES.-Distemper virus received from England was found to be non-pathogenic for pariah dogs although it was still virulent after re-dispatch to England. Canine typhus was studied bacteriologically for salmonella organisms, but results were negative.FOWL DISEASES.-Strains of " avian distemper " [Ranikhet disease=New-castle disease?] virus imported from abroad died out. Fowl typhoid was diagnosed on two occasions during the year.HELMINTHOLOGICAL STUDIES.-The serious fluke invasion of cattle in the Kumaon hills with Fasciola gigantica was studied. Limnaea acuminata was found to be the molluscan host. It is easily killed by dilute copper sulfate and danistol gave good results therapeutically.A monograph on the helminth parasites of domesticated animals in India was prepared by BHALERAO [this Bull. 3. 811].REPORT OF THE SEROLOGICAL SECTION. [HADDOW, J. R.]RINDERPEST.-The following miscellaneous findings are recorded: -(1) a certain proportion of calves immunized by various methods do not react and remain susceptible; (2) formalinized vaccines are effective but risky; (3) the serum-virus method was the most suitable for Indian cattle; (4) virus was recovered from the spleen of a bull given virus 74 days previously; (5) rinderpest infection has an incubation period of 24 to 36 hours after intravenous inoculation and a period of 100 to 120 hours after intrathecal inoculation; (6) goat passage removes piro-plasmic contamination of virus blood: such contamination is also avoidable by using cerebrospinal fluid; (7) work with goat virus gave favourable preliminary results and (8) work on the concentration of immune serum by fractionation was begun.OTHER DISEASES.-The work on anthrax, black leg, haemorrhagic septicaemia, bovine contagious abortion and septic pneumonia of calves is described. Corynebact. pyogenes was isolated from several cases of the latter condition.EQUINE DISEASES.-Systematic vaccination was applied to all mares in one stud infected with Bact. abortus equi. Results were not complete. In other studs where losses through abortion had occurred, mixed infection was encountered. As regards glanders, rough variants of B. [Pfeifferella] mallei were found unsuitable for the production of mallein. Several cases of joint-ill were investigated, either Str. equi or Bact. abortus equi being found.REPORT OF THE PROTOZOOLOGY SECTION. [SEN, S. K.]SURRA.-Bayer 205 was found to be effective (5 to 8 g. intravenously per 1, 000 lb. body weight) on six artificially infected ponies. Of two buffaloes infected with Tryp. evansi, one was given Bayer 205 and the other left untreated; neither became clinically ill.PIROPLASMOSIS.-Some cattle were inoculated with Theileria with negative results and one imported Dutch bull died of what was considered to be Th.annulata infection. Plasmoquine (5 doses of 16 c.c. of 1 per cent. solution) proved effective in an acute case of theileriasis in a hill bull, although ineffective in the case of the Dutch bull. Some new drugs are being tried out. Trypaflavine has been found useful against Babesia bigemina in cattle. An effective non-toxic dose of 25 c.c. of a 1 per cent. solution intravenously has been adopted.An infection held to be anaplasmosis was found in an imported Ayrshire bull.Some parasites similar to Babesia sergenti were found in four goats in association with mild anaemia.Piroplasma [Babesia] gibsoni infection in dogs was studied: it appeared that continuous passaging caused an exaltation in virulence. Trypaflavine was useless as a curative in two cases (15 c.c. of 1 per cent. solution per 25 lb. body weight). Research on tick transmission was continued.OTHER INFECTIONS.-Four cases of buffalo malaria were found. Transmission trials with Aedes albopictus failed. Coccidial infection was found in one dog and one buffalo.Tryp. lewisi was found in rats. The adhesion phenomenon using Tryp. evansi in rats was studied; the results were negative.ENTOMOLOGY, ETC.- Aedes albopictus was found for the first time near Muktesar. The collection of ox warbles from hill bulls was continued. Larval forms were found in the spleen and lungs. A calliphorid fly occurring near Muktesar was studied. Sarcoptic mange was found in a pony. Larval Linguatula senata were recovered from the lungs of goats.ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DEPUTY DEIRCTOR, IMPERIAL VETERINARY SERUM INSTITUTE, IZATNAGAR.

J	Fortner, J.								Experimentelle Untersuchungen uber die ansteckende Schweinelahme								ZEITSCHR INFEKTIONSKRANKH PARASITARE KRANKH U HYG HAUSTIERE				59	(1/2)			81	81						1942	1942	This is a detailed discussion of the disease and a report on 2 yrs. of exptl. investigation. The disease is described as an infectious swine paralysis (Teschener Krankeit, menigoencephalo-myelitis enzootica Suum non purulenta). It was first described by Trefny in 1930; a later outbreak was descr. in Teschen, by Klobouk in 1931 to 1933, who started an investigation of its nature and described it as a specific disease due to a neurotropic virus. It spread rapidly through Austria in 1938 and Jugoslavia and Germany in 1940. Four strains of virus were used in this study. Intranasal instillations of the virus were the most satisfactory method of infection. There was some difference in the virulence of different strains as indicated in the difference in length of the incubation period and rapidity of death. The disease was developed experimentally in 349 of 362 animals inoculated intranasally. Using a slightly more attenuated strain virus 81% of the exptl. swine were infected by this method. Only 14 of 74 animals were infected by feeding, and 3 of 29 by other methods of exposure. Intra-musc. and subdural methods were successful, but not subcut., intraven., intraperit. or intravag. 3 of 29 animals acquired the disease by pen contact. In all stages of the disease it is similar to poliomyelitis in man. The author failed to transmit the disease to any animal except swine by any method of inoculation, feeding, or nasal instillation of virus material. During the 1st and 2d stages of the disease the virus could be recovered from the brain and cord. One strain of virus was passed through 9, and another through 18 series of . animals. The virus was found in the feces of 7 animals during the prodromal stage. Virus was not found in the nasal discharges, urine, saliva, bile, muscle or ischiatic nerve and was doubtful on 2 occasions in the blood. The incubation period was 7-34 days. The prodromal stage was 1-3 days. During this period there is fever and loss of appetite. Following this is the characteristic period of paralysis with staggering, breaking down, stiffness. In about half the cases there was nervousness, excitement and cramps. Most animals died in 3-5 days, a few survived for 2 weeks and died mostly with pneumonia. Early death may be due to respiratory failure. The prodromal, or beginning of the paralytic phase, should be included in the incubation period. During this time the temp. may rise for 1-3 days and then become suddenly subnormal. If the animal survives for some time the temp. returns to normal, the appetite improves but the animal may show spastic paralysis, muscle atrophy and stiffness of the joints. Histologically there is vascular and perivascular infiltration of lymphoid cells with glial and ganglion cell degeneration. The path. changes are most common in the gray matter and especially of the brain stem and cervical and lumbar regions of the cord. The virus does not grow on the chorio-allantoic membrane of hen's eggs and passes the Berkefed-N filter. It was resistant to 50% glycerol at 20[degree] C for 21 days, and to desiccation for 53 days; 1/2 hr. at 70[degree] C destroyed it. Infected brain and cord material would still cause disease after 1:1000 dilution. Recovered animals were resistant to a fatal dose of the virus given 5 weeks after recovery. Immunization with 1 injn. of a formol-virus vaccine did not lead to satisfactory immunity; 2 injns. gave better results. Attempts to produce an antiserum were not successful. A product called Vigantol (Vigantol fur Tiere der Behringwerke[long dash]vitamin D), was injd. twice in 3-ml. doses subcut. This retarded infection for 9-10 days longer than in untreated animals. In untreated animals the disease rate was 40% while in the control group it was 78% in 1 expt. reported. Intranasal instillation of a 2% ZnSO4 soln. retarded infection by way of the nasal passages for 14 days. There is no sharp line of demarcation between this disease and swine pest and epizootic pneumonia (Ferkelgrippe). Recovery from swine paralysis did not protect against swine pest. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. D. Bushnell																					BCI:BCI19431700020572

The authors, in very elaborate and extensive experimental work, claim to have furnished conclusive evidence that the cause is Rickettsia orientalis. Intraocular inoculation of the virus invariably produces a specific disease of the eye, and in the endothelial cells of Descemet's membrane the micro-organism can invariably be found. R. orientalis is identical in every respect with the organism isolated from the tissues of tsutsugamushi cases, as well as with the virus from experimentally infected animals. Inoculation of the endothelial cells of Descemet's membrane harboring the microorganisms even in small amounts, induces a severe infection. Introduction of virus-containing material into eyes immune against the disease induces no infection and the microorganism can not be recovered following such inoculations. The histological changes in the eye induced by the virus are identical with those found in natural cases or with those produced experimentally in animals. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A.

The mice were observed for 16 days, lethality rate, protection coefficient and average life span were evaluated. Virus concentration in lungs was determined by using titration in MDCK cell line. Results. Combined administration of ridostin and tamiflu after the, infection increased survivability of the animals when compared with the control group, and reduced influenza virus concentration in lungs. Conclusion. Treatment effect during combined administration of ridostin and tamiflu after influenza virus infection increased.																					BCI:BCI201100740078	22145356	
J			EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS U.S.A.						EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS U.S.A.								EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORTS OF AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENTAL STATIONS U.S.A.															1938	1938	The matter given here is a bare outline of the work done. When papers by the staffs of these stations are published, abstracts are prepared from them and included in the Veterinary Bulletin as a matter of routine. Details of the titles of these reports will be found in Index Veterinarius.ARIZONA, 1937-38.-5 c.c. injections of gonadotrophic serum given in two doses at 18-day intervals did not produce ovulation in Black-Faced ewes. Good results have been obtained in the control of ACTINOMYCOSIS by giving potassium iodide (3 dr. per day) in the drinking water. Sodium iodide (1 oz. in 250 c.c. of sterile water) also gave good results. For the first time INFECTIOUS RHINITIS occurred in a herd of swine in Arizona and considerable losses were suffered.ARKANSAS, 1938-39.-A description of the pathological conditions of the endocrine organs of the rat in AVITAMINOSIS is given.COLORADO, 1938-39.-In work on POISONOUS PLANTS, silky sophora (Sophora sericea), previously under suspicion, was found to be non-toxic. Bahia oppositifolia was found to contain hydrocyanic acid and to be toxic when fed to a steer, ewe and g. pig. Oxytenia acerosa may now be listed as poisonous. In a series of 199 lambs and five ewes autopsied, 41 showed "fringed tapeworms" (Thysanosoma actinioides) in the liver, 39 in the intestines, and 19 in both the intestines and the liver. Up to 4, 884 cases of EQUINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS were reported, the mortality being approximately 15%. The use of chick vaccine was a satisfactory control measure. Work on SLIPPED TENDON indicates that phosphorus alone added to a ration moderately low in calcium does not cause this disease, but when calcium is added to rations already high in phosphorus perosis is aggravated. The iodine requirements of poultry are also discussed.GEORGIA, 1938-39.-Work was carried out on PARASITES. The stomach worm Haemonchus contortus and the nodular worm Oesophagosto-mum columbianum cause most damage in this state.ILLINOIS, 1938-39.-The various methods of controlling BRUCELLA INFECTION are discussed. The permanent advantages of treatment for INTESTINAL PARASITES of horses are shown in tabular form. During the year, losses from "CORNSTALK DISEASE" in horses diminished, only an occasional outbreak being reported in contrast to a loss of 5, 000 horses in 1935. Up to date the aetiological findings are negative, but the disease may be controlled by preventing horses from having access to damaged maize. A project has been started to produce strains of chickens resistant to PULLORUM DISEASE. The number of recorded outbreaks increased from 228 in 1936 to 493 in 1937. During the past year 133, 125 lots of pullorum stained antigen were prepared and supplied. Control of INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS is an urgent problem. A total of 29, 504 doses of FOWL Pox vaccine were prepared. 8, 087 doses of egg-propagated virus and 6, 157 doses of comb virus were distributed to veterinarians. Pfeifferella anati-pestifer infection in ducks appeared in the state for the first time.IOWA, 1938-39.-Experimental work demonstrated that the vitamin E requirements of goats were vastly different from those of rats. Results indicated that either goats do not need vitamin E for normal reproduction or that, if synthesis of the vitamin by the goat does occur, it is produced only in amounts sufficient to meet the requirements of the developing fetus. RANGE PARALYSIS in poultry, and a genetic investigation of the resistance and susceptibility of laboratory animals to typhoid-like diseases are also dealt with.MARYLAND, 1938-39.-Further work on BRUCELLA INFECTION using milk samples from cows showing suspicious agglutination reactions failed to show the organism in the udder. A scheme termed "Bang's Disease-Calfhood Vaccination" was begun, and at present 16 herds containing 650 vaccinated animals are under observation. SULPHAPYRIDINE, was found to be ineffective for the treatment of the disease. Chicks from a Maryland experimental station, bred for resistance to PULLORUM DISEASE over an 11-year period, exhibited a significantly higher survival rate throughout trials when compared with pullorum-clean and pullorum-tested stock. During the year, TRICHOMONIASIS was found in a few herds." A record, in tabular form, is given of the major activities of the Maryland livestock sanitary service.MISSISSIPPI, 1938-39.-Possibly one-third of all the turkeys hatched in this state die each year from BLACKHEAD. The use of tobacco dust in the ration has given encouraging results in protection of turkeys against this disease. The feeding of 2% tobacco dust to chickens has been found effective for the eradication of ROUNDWORMS.NEVADA, 1937-38.-The present Veterinary Science building now houses the joint offices of the Research Station and the State Veterinary Control Service, as well as the station's chemical and bacteriological laboratories. Problems mainly studied have been REDWATER, and ENCEPHALOMYELITIS of horses.NEW HAMPSHIRE, 1938.-Studies carried out in animal metabolism and nutrition are briefly described. Experiments have shown that whole milk feeding of dairy calves can be limited to a period of a few days following birth, if skim milk is supplemented with cod liver oil concentrate.Experiments showed that if calves are vaccinated against BRUCELLOSIS between the ages of 4-6 months the majority will give a negative blood reaction within a year. 50, 011 blood samples were tested during 1937-38, as compared with 22, 026 for the previous year. Out of a total of 243 cows tested for MASTITIS, 92 animals or 38% showed infection. 535 strains of streptococci have been isolated from infected cows, and 87.7 % have been identified as Streptococcus agalactiae. Experiments indicate that neither vaccines, prontylin, nor pronto-sil are effective in treatment. New records for the highest percentage of adult birds tested in the state and the lowest percentage incidence of PULLORUM DISEASE of any state in the U.S.A. were established for the season 1937-38. 47 % of the total adult birds of the state were tested, with 99.94 % non-reactors. Eleven flocks were added to the list of pullorum-free flocks, making the total 96 clean flocks. One flock was removed from the list because of infection and four on account of failure to test. Birds artificially infected with chronic COCCIDIOSIS showed definite improvement under litter treatment with sulphur in one case and with the feeding of bicarbonate of soda in another case. Experiments indicated that RICKETS in young chickens is not favoured by chronic coccidiosis. The total number of doses of FOWL Pox vaccine distributed during the year was 264, 400, a decrease of 29, 800 on the previous year. During the year, 65, 400 doses of LARYNGOTRACHEITIS vaccine were distributed, as compared with 97, 100 doses in the previous year. Poultry autopsies carried out during the year numbered 1, 762; ruptured egg yolk was the principal trouble, being found in 24.2 % of all adult birds examined.NEW JERSEY, 1937-38.-Research on DAIRY CATTLE DISEASE, made possible by special appropriation, was attempted on a large scale during the year. The Experimental Station at Beemerville has been placed at the disposal of the research staff. Studies were continued on POULTRY DISEASES, 6, 143 specimens from 2, 121 farms being examined during the year. Work continued with the paralysis-free line of White Leghorns and the so-called paralysis line of Leghorns. Tabulation of the results shows that both the percentage of total mortality and the percentage of paralysis have been decreasing in the paralysis-free line.PENNSYLVANIA, 1938-39.-Results of a feeding experiment showed that pigs weighing 40-70 Ib. made the most efficient use of high protein rations, while pigs weighing more than 150 Ib. were wasteful in this respect. Stiffness occurred in from 40-60 % of the experimental animals. Addition of cod liver oil concentrate did not alleviate this condition nor did adjustments of the amount and proportion of the minerals present in the ration. The production of stiffness seems to be characteristic of rations which are made up of maize, alfalfa, soyabean oilmeal, low protein tankage, and salt. A deficiency of manganese may be a contributing factor in the disorder, no stiffness having been observed in 15 pigs which were fed a manganese supplement.SOUTH CAROLINA, 1937-38.-Among the many causes of DIGESTIVE DISTURBANCES and SCOURS in calves is the spillage of milk into the rumen when the calf is swallowing. The "Coyner" nipple pail designed to simulate the natural method of milk consumption has been studied and results indicate that the individuality in the manner of drinking from an open pail is an important factor in whether or not milk enters the rumen. Sulphanilamide gave good results in the treatment of acute MASTITIS. Whole oats supplied "free choice" apparently reduced the incidence of CANNIBAL-ISM in poultry. The addition of manganese to a ration without oats was of no benefit in the control of the condition. The control of KIDNEY WORMS and ROUNDWORMS in swine by methods of sanitation is discussed.SOUTH DAKOTA, 1937-38.-In connexion with SELENIUM POISONING, results of the vegetation survey are given together with a list of the plants which take up selenium in high concentrations. The effects of vitamin D deficiency in cows are described. In dealing with anthelmintics, the properties of oil of chenopodium, obtained from plants produced by the cross-fertilization of Chenopodium ambro-sioides with a wild variety, are recorded and the anthelmintic properties of this cross against ASCARIS are described. An experiment on immunization against HAEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA is recorded.SOUTH DAKOTA, 1938-39.-Preliminary results seem to indicate that chenopodium plants may be used as a forage crop for hogs to eliminate worms. The bacterin for HAEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA immunization which, had been found to give the best results was one in which organisms of a buffalo strain were grown in a medium consisting of one part of normal rabbit serum and three parts brain-heart infusion, incubated for 48 hours, the whole culture being then treated with formalin. It was found that the addition of normal rabbit serum to the broth greatly increased the immunizing power of the bacterin. Work on the prevention of SELENIUM POISONING by feeding arsenic has given excellent results with rats and dogs.TEXAS, 1937.-In two out of three experiments, cows which were drenched with the putrid material of mice dead (experimentally) from LOIN DISEASE developed the disease. [No further details given]. A recently organized scheme provides for the study of insect vectors of ANAPLASMOSIS in Texas. All attempts to transmit the disease by means of Dermacentor variabilis and various flies failed. Experiments showed that fever reactions indicating positive immunization (by infective blood) began on an average about 31 days after infection and lasted for an average of 7 1/2 days. Station records show that one animal was recorded as a carrier over a period of 5 years and 2 months. Another which was the reservoir for immunization still harboured infection after 6 1/2 years. Control of TRICHOMONAD ABORTION in the College dairy herd consisted of suspending breeding operations for six months and local treatment of the bulls' penis. POISONOUS PLANTS causing losses are discussed. Vitamin A requirements for beef cattle and for sheep and goats, and vitamin D and mineral requirements for chicks are discussed, and dietetic experiments in connexion with SLIPPED TENDON are recorded.TEXAS, 1938.-A number of experiments on ANAPLASMA INFECTION with different species of biting flies and ticks (Amblyomma maculatura, Dermacentor variabilis and Ixodes ricinus) was carried out, but no transmissions were obtained. Studies made on the use of the so-called distilled water mercuric chloride and formol-gel tests indicate that these tests cannot be relied upon to pick out carrier animals in all cases. Experiments were made on vitamin deficiencies. The vitamin A requirements for cattle, sheep, and goats were determined and a preliminary investigation on the role of nicotinic acid in the nutrition of ruminants was completed but no definite conclusions were drawn. Studies on the vitamin A requirements of chicks showed that 100-125 mug. of carotene per 100 g. of feed gave as low mortality and as satisfactory health as did higher levels of carotene.WISCONSIN, 1938-39.-A disease diagnosed as distemper killed large numbers of mink during the year. Dog distemper antiserum produced only a temporary immunity, but a more lasting immunity was conferred by a tissue vaccine made from the internal organs of a mink that had died of the disease. A serious disease of unknown aetiology and affecting both mink and foxes, is also described. The findings of the investigations being carried out in regard to hormone response and STERILITY in cattle are recorded. Other important points from the report are as follows: - saline pills help to overcome the more serious effects of COCCIDIOSIS, probably by maintaining a constant osmotic pressure in the blood and thus reducing the blood sugar content; SLIPPED TENDON or PEROSIS in chicks is caused by a deficiency or imperfect absorption of manganese due to excess of calcium phosphate (contained in bone meal) in the ration [see also V.B. 11. 49.]; feeding small amounts of desiccated thyroid prevents the structural changes which normally take place in the liver during the treatment of vitamin B1 deficiency by thiamin.WYOMING, 1938-39.-A high content of potassium nitrate in oat hay was found to be the cause of heavy losses in cattle in northern and eastern Wyoming. The nitrate breaks down in the rumen to produce nitrite which in turn enters the blood to produce methaemoglobin, thus causing death from lack of oxygen as in carbon monoxide poisoning. Sheep did not seem to be as susceptible as cattle. It was found that there is a wide variation in the hydrocyanic acid content of arrow grass. The drier the soil upon which the plant grows, the higher the hydrocyanic acid content. Intravenous injection of a mixture of sodium thio-sulphate and sodium nitrite was found more effective as an antidote for cyanide poisoning than sodium tetrathionate. An introduced weed, Salvia lanceolata, belonging to the mint family was suspected of causing losses in the Platte county. 1 lb. dried weight of this plant given in 1/2 lb. doses kills a 100 ib. sheep. Tests with lambs on the state farm at Worland indicate that little or no benefit results from vaccination of sheep for INFECTIOUS SORE MOUTH after the land has been exposed to infection, or from vaccination less than ten days previous to such infection. In carefully controlled experiments at the stock farm, Laramie, vaccines prepared at the station protected lambs from the disease. Immunity was developed within three weeks after vaccination. Outbreaks of ABORTION in ewes have occurred in a few places. In some of the cases it seemed possible that the cause was heavy feeding with barley. A third year of tests on ROUP in chickens showed that inoculation with coryza in summer is valueless for giving pullets an immunity against roup in the winter. During the year, 27, 251 blood samples were tested for BRUCELLA INFECTION, 3.7% of them being positive. On May 1st, 1939, 11.8% of all breeding cattle over six months old in the state Were under supervision for eradication of the disease.X-ray treatment was unsuccessful for cure or prevention of COCCIDIOSIS, and domestic chickens could not be infected with Eimeria centrocerci or other species of Eimeria which infect the sage grouse.-F.

Investigations during the 1971 epizootic of Venezuelan equine encephalitis in Texas and subsequent experimental infection and intracage transmission studies with two strains of the virus in cotton rats, Sigmodon hispidus (Say and Ord).								Dissertation Abstracts International				36B	5			2071	2072						1975	1975	In studies in 1971 in Texas and Mexico when an epidemic of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) spread into Texas, the VEE virus was isolated from a gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), a Cabot's sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) and from three species of mosquitoes, no evidence was found of permanent establishment of VEE virus in nature at either site. In subsequent experiments with cotton rats, contact transmission was investigated as an extra-arthropod mechanism for the maintenance of two VEE strains in nature at times when the vector populations are low. Contact transmission was demonstrated with both VEE strains, but it was more effective with (a) the epizootic Three Rivers strain than with (b) the enzootic Fe3-7c strain. The high mortality rate among cotton rats inoculated with (a) indicated that the cotton rat would not be as good a reservoir host for that strain as it is for (b).

These were manifested by a reduction in the concentration of total phosphorus and nitrogen in these organs during and particularly by the end of the infection, as well as by an increase in the fat content in them. The extent of metabolism disorders depended upon the duration and severity of the infection and upon the age of animals. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19684900020163	4301333

Pest Infestation Control Laboratory report 1971-73.								xvi + 286pp.	xvi + 286pp.						1975	1975	During 1974 the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory and the Regional Pests Service were merged. The report is divided into five parts. The first two deal with the biology and control of the pests; the third with chemical and biochemical studies to elucidate the mode of action of pesticides and to find methods for analysing their residues in foodstuffs and in animal tissue; the fourth with pesticide and wild life incidents and with insect infestation in imports; and the fifth with the Laboratory's information and training work and contribution to international activities. It was shown that iodofenphos at 1.1 g/m2 applied as water dispersible powder to the ceilings and walls was effective in destroying about 98% of the cockroach (Blatta orientalis) population and drastically reducing the number of flies in piggeries. Control of flies in enclosed lamp-warmed creep pens was achieved by using trichlorphon varnish. In milking parlours pyrethrin aerosol controlled the stable fly Stomoxys calcitrans. Aflatoxin B1 at 16-17 ppm was detected on gamma irradiated wheat. Methyl bromide as a concentration-time product of 800 mg/h/litre obtained in 20 h at 25 deg C destroyed Salmonella spp. in poultry feed. Rats experimentally infected with Leptospira lost detectable antibodies within 8 weeks, but continued to excrete living leptospires for 8 months, demonstrating the readiness with which they can enter a true 'carrier state'. In rabbits infected with myxomatosis virus, the proportion of infective fleas was directly related to the virus titres in the skin lesions. In two surveys, Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from badgers in Gloucestershire and Cornwall.<new para>ADDITIONAL ABSTRACT:<new para>In 1974, the Pest Infestation Control Laboratory became part of the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and was combined with the Regional Pests Service.

Insecticide studies showed that iodofenphos at 1.1 g/m2 applied in piggeries as a water-dispersible powder to walls and ceiling gave 98% control of Blattella germanica (L.) and good control of Musca domestica L. In other studies, Stomoxys calcitrans (L.) was reduced in numbers in a milking parlour by an aerosol of pyrethrins; the flies could also be removed from the cows as they entered the parlour by a curtain of plastic strips and a fine spray of water at the entrance.

The effect observed was of marked synergistic nature. Subcultures of the susceptible strain in the presence of ribavirin/ACAA did not lead to the development of resistance to ACAA, ribavirin or their combination. The ACAA resistant strain preserved its susceptibility to ribavirin after serial subcultures in the presence of both the inhibitors. However, no synergistic effect of the combination under such conditions was observed. It was of principal importance that in the subcultures of the ACAA resistant strain in the presence of ribavirin its susceptibility to ACAA recovered. ACAA was efficient in inhibition of Sindbis virus reproduction in the brain of the intracerebrally infected uninbred albino mice. The maximum inhibitory effect was observed after repeated administrations of ACAA under the treatment and prophylactic regimens. Ribavirin markedly increased the ACAA protective effect.																					BCI:BCI199799703657	9334146

Spleen index and histological changes in thymus, spleen and lymph nodes were evaluated after 14 days in mice vaccinated with BCG and after 7 days in mice vaccinated with Coparvax. Foot pad test was also performed by giving vaccine into three feet. Tuberculin was injected into mouse foot pad on the day 7th and 14th and a lysate of Coparvax vaccine on the 7th. Spleen index and foot pad test showed higher values in mice vaccinated with Coparvax than with BCG. Histological changes of thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes showed morphological differences depending on the type of vaccine used. Both preparations were characterized by stimulating effect on recticuloendothelial system, which was much more pronounced after giving Coparvax vaccine.

These viruses are viscerotropic, besides the central nervous system [CNS], they reproduce actively in the subdermal cellular tissue on the site of the injection; in the lymphatic nodes, spleen, and intestine. The presence of 2 phases in the reproduction of both viruses was noted: the visceral phase and the CNS phase. The Malayan virus (TR-21) being similar to the tick-borne encephalitis virus in tropism is distinguishable from it by its slower spread within the organism and by lower reproductive activity.

B	MOHLER, J. R.								Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 1933.								Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 1933.								47 pp.	47 pp.						1933	1933	Weekly counts of stable flies [Stomoxys calcitrans L.] captured in traps in central Iowa during the summer and autumn of 1932 showed that the numbers increased during the first part of August, decreased in the latter part of the month and suddenly increased again during the first two weeks of September. A study of the incidence of swine fever (hog-cholera) in Iowa during the same period revealed one peak in the latter part of August and another in the latter part of September, thus following the periods of maximum fly prevalence by about two weeks. Although these data are not conclusive proof of transmission by the fly, they support those previously obtained [cf. R.A.E., B 18 100]. A stock solution containing 20 per cent. coconut-oil soap and 5 per cent. orthophenylphenol diluted with warm water (1: 50) and used as a shampoo for dogs and cats is effective in killing their fleas, promotes healing of cuts and other external injuries and has no apparent toxic effects even in stronger concentrations. One per cent. orthophenylphenol dissolved in milk of lime destroyed mites when sprayed over the interior of fowl houses.As a result of the continued campaign for the eradication of Boophilus annulatus Say, further areas were released from Federal Quarantine during the year, the infested area, which is now only one-twelfth of its original size, being confined to parts of Florida, Louisiana and Texas. It appears that the cattle-fever (piroplasmosis) tick now generally found in the infested areas of Florida is B. annulatus australis Fuller [cf. 21 101], which is believed to be able to complete its life-cycle on one or more wild animals in addition to its domestic hosts. For this reason its eradication may involve the control of certain game animals. During the year, a few cases of re-infestation in tick-free areas, apparently due to the presence of numerous deer and of this variety of tick, were reported. Experiments on the vectors of anaplasmosis of cattle have shown that the disease may be transmitted by adults of Rhipicephalus sanguineus Latr., infected as nymphs [cf. 19 66] and by Ixodes scapularis Say. Hereditary transmission [see the two following abstracts] has only been obtained in the case of the cattle-fever tick [B. annulatus]. A study of piroplasmosis has shown that both Piroplasma (Babesia) bigeminum and P. (B.) argentinum occur in Louisiana.In the central zone of an area in Colorado in which an experiment on the eradication of cattle grubs [Hypoderma] has been in progress during the last five years, the number of larvae per animal was 5.1, as compared with 9.2 in the previous year and 35 at the beginning of the experiment. The animals have been effectively and safely treated by inserting into the warble holes small medicated rods made from 3/4 oz. gum arabic, 1/4 oz. glue, 1/4 oz. tannic acid powder and 2 oz. derris powder mixed with enough water to make a stiff paste.It has been determined that Gastrophilus intestinalis DeG., reaches the stomach of a horse 21-28 days after the larvae are taken into the mouth [cf. 18 274]. The experiments indicate that the animal can be successfully treated one month after the disappearance of the adult flies in the autumn, provided that it does not become re-infested from eggs laid on its coat; the eggs on the coat can be destroyed by the application of suitable disinfectants.

J	PERLA, D.; MARMORSTON, J.								Role of vitamin C in resistance.								Arch. Pathol.				28				543	575						1937	1937	1. These two papers are a review of the experimental evidence obtained chiefly, with guineapigs on scorbutic diets, and with rats and rabbits, and of such observations as have been made on human beings. The evidence is somewhat conflicting but' an attempt is made to summarise the present State of knowledge.Deficiency of vitamin C [ascorbic acid] does not interfere with the formation of natural antibodies although it impairs the effectiveness of immunization to tetanus and diphtheria toxin. Subclinical scurvy may be associated with increased skin sensitivity to tuberculin and increased susceptibility to anaphylaxis, but in manifest scurvy the skin reactions are suppressed, and the anaphylactic reaction reduced. Complete deficiency of vitamin C [ascorbic acid] is thought to lower natural resistance to subsequently induced acute infection. Chronic deficiency lowers the resistance of the guineapig to induced infection with the beta streptococcus, and a condition resembling rheumatic fever results.																					CABI:19371401804		
J	BLANC, G.; BALTAZARD, M.								A Series of Papers on Typhus.								Arch. Inst. Pasteur Maroc				2	4			535	715						1944	1944	This series comprises the following 11 papers, all of which are by Blanc & Baitazard only, with the exception indicated.Revue chronologique sur la transmission et la conservation naturelles des typhus (pp. 535-577). This is a review of the literature published up to 1939.Etude du comportement des virus exanthematiques chez divers ectoparasites: I. Comportement du virus du typhus murin chez le pou de l'ane, Haematopinus asini, by Blanc, L. A. Martin & Baitazard (pp. 578-585), II. Comportement du virus du typhus epidemique chez les puces, Xenopsylla cheopis et Pulex irrit'ans (pp. 586-601) and III. Comportement des virus de la fievre boutonneuse et de la fievre pourpree chez les puces Xenopsylla cheopis et Ctenocephalos canis (pp. 602-610). The contents of the first and the greater part of the second of this group of papers have been noticed from briefer sources [R.A.E., 28 129; 29 15]. The second also contains accounts of experiments in which Xenopsylla. cheopis, Roths., failed to transmit epidemic typhus to guineapigs by biting when the possibility of contamination by excreta was excluded, and did so in only a proportion of cases and after prolonged exposure when it was not, whereas a rat exposed to fleas and contamination by their excreta, readily became infected. A rat infested with fleas spends much time licking its fur. In so doing, it ingests large numbers and also dilutes the excreta on the fur, thus facilitating penetration of the mucous membranes by the infecting agent, whereas an infested guineapig scratches superficially to dislodge fleas, but does not lick. Epidemic typhus was transmitted to monkeys (Macaca sylvana) by placing the dry excreta of infected fleas, which had been kept in the laboratory for 8-115 days, on the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and lips. A few experiments, details of which are not given, showed that the behaviour of the causal agent of epidemic typhus in Pulex irritans, L., was the same as in X. cheopis.The third paper deals with experiments carried out in 1938-40 on the behaviour of the agents of Marseilles fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever in X. cheopis and Ctenocephalides (Ctenocephalus) canis, Curt. The agent of Marseilles fever survived for 44 days in examples of X. cheopis that had bitten infected rats, but they did not transmit the disease by biting and their excreta were not infective when injected intraperitoneally into guineapigs 0-15 days after collection. C. canis acquired the infection from guineapigs, but its excreta were not infective. Fleas of only one out of many batches of X. cheopis harboured the agent after being confined with infected guineapigs. X. cheopis has been found to bite guineapigs much less readily than rats, and biting experiments made on the former have therefore comparatively little significance.When batches of crushed fleas (X. cheopis) that had completed a few meals .1-70 days previously on a guineapig ill with Rocky Mountain spotted fever were inoculated into guineapigs, fleas that had had their last infecting meal 3, 7 and 12 days previously induced infection but the others did not. The fleas did not transmit the disease by biting, and their excreta were not infective when injected intraperitoneally into guineapigs. Guineapigs did not become infected by injection of crushed fleas that were the offspring of those fleas. When the fleas had the opportunity of feeding on infected animals for a long time, the infection persisted in them throughout their life, but they did not transmit it by biting and their excreta were not infective.Recherches sur l'immunite dans les maladies exanthematiques humaines: I.

Reinfection inapparente (pp. 633-650). IV. Immunite generale et immunite locale (pp. 651-655). This group of papers deals with investigations made from 1933 to 1942 on immunity in human diseases of the typhus group, and earlier work on this subject is also reviewed It is demonstrated in the first that the immunity conferred by apparent infec tion with epidemic and murine typhus, Marseilles fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever is complete and lasting, no reinfection ever having been observed by the authors, and that an equally strong cross immunity exists between Marseilles fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever and between epidemic and murine typhus. In the second, it is demonstrated that inapparent infection with the four diseases in man and animals confers absolute immunity for several years, and in the third that inapparent reinfection is extremely rare. It was only once observed in the course of the 31 experiments described, which involved the four diseases and inoculation of 233 animals in attempts to recover the agent. This was inapparent infection with Rocky Mountain spotted fever in a guineapig that had had inapparent Marseilles fever 1.41/2 months earlier.Recherches sur le mode de transmission du typhus: I. Non-transmission du typhus exanthematique par piqures de poux infectes (pp. II. Le reservoir de virus naturel des typhus, les dejections d'ectoparasites infectes (pp. 658-673). In the experiments described in the first of these two papers, lice [Pediculus humanus, L.] taken from two persons infected with epidemic typhus failed to infect eight Europeans on whom they fed through bolting silk under conditions that made contamination of the skin by louse excreta impossible. Each person was exposed for 15 minutes to about 140 lice (which were subsequently shown to be infected) and was later shown to be susceptible to murine typhus.Data collected from 1937 to 1942 on the infectiveness of the excreta of ectoparasites infected with murine typhus are discussed in the second paper, largely from the point of view of the preparation of vaccines. Experiments are described showing that infected fleas emit uniformly infected excreta throughout life, irrespective of season or temperature, and the same is true of epidemic typhus [29 16]. Injection into guineapigs of less than 1 mmg. of excreta never caused infection, 1- mmg. gave apparent infection or none when injected intraperitoncally and inapparent infection or none when injected subcutaneously or intradcrmically, and higher doses almost always gave apparent infection after an incubation period of six days when injected intraperitoneally, and an immunizing inapparent infection in all cases when injected subcutaneously or intradermically. In man, infection always followed intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of 10 mmg. [cf. 28 128] and followed injection by the same routes of 1 mmg. in a high percentage of cases. The excreta did not lose infectiveness when stored for 4<pounds> years; the agent of epidemic typhus also persisted for a considerable time in stored flea excreta, but the experiments were not continued for so long. The highest and lowest temperatures met with in nature and alternation of these temperatures did not affect' persistence of the infective agent in excreta so long as they were kept protected from humidity. It was destroyed by exposure to ordinary daylight for 12 months but not for six, by an hour's exposure to 120°C. [248°F.] in a dry atmosphere or to 60-80°C. [140-176°F] in a damp atmosphere, or by fumigation with sulphur dioxide for 30-120 minutes, but was not affected by fumigation with methyl bromide, which is sometimes used against lice in clothing. Experiments on man showed that its normal mode of passage from the dry excreta into the vertebrate host is through the mucous membranes.Transmission et conservation naturelles des typhus. Immunite. Epidemio-logie. Prophylaxie (pp. 674-704). This paper forms a conclusion to the series and is a critical review of the literature. Epidemic typhus is not transmitted by the bites of infected lice. Natural infection of the vertebrate host with the typhus fevers occurs through penetration of the mucous membranes by the causal agents from the excreta of ectoparasites. These excreta are the reservoir. The agent can circulate in the blood of persons who have no symptoms and infect ectoparasites, thus increasing the intensity of an epidemic. As a man has been found to be susceptible to infection a comparatively short time after having the agent circulating in his blood, the hypothesis is put forward that, in addition to persons with inapparent infection, there are healthy carriers who do not acquire lasting immunity. The causal agents of murine and epidemic typhus are distinct entities, and each is a single type and does not comprise a number of different strains. If a louse-transmitted epidemic of murine typhus occurred, it could do so only where lice were abundant and epidemic typhus was therefore likely to occur also, and it would immunize much of the population. The basic measure for preventing the spread of epidemic typhus remains the control of Pediculus humanus, but disinfection should also be designed to destroy the agent in its excreta on the clothes or in the houses of infected persons. In view of the susceptibility of the agent to moisture, this is best done by washing in weak disinfectant for the house and furnishings and steam sterilisation for clothing and bedding.Index bibliographique (pp.705-715).

The action in vitro of normal human serum on the pathogenic trypanosomes, and its significance								ANN TROP MED & PARASITOL				24	(1)			115	160						1930	1930	The authors give an exhaustive review of the mass of literature dealing with the protective and curative action of normal human serum in mice infected with certain pathogenic trypanosomes. Contrary to previous workers, they show that normal human serum] is also markedly trypanocidal in vitro at 37[degree] C. when tested against Trypanosoma equiperdum, T. congolense and a laboratory strain of T. rhodesiense. Comparatively little trypanocidal action in vitro was exhibited against a recently isolated strain of T. rhodesiense and none against a laboratory strain of T. gambiense. Experimental methods for these tests are given in detail. The authors believe that these results give the strongest grounds for believing that man's natural immunity to the trypanosomes of stock and his susceptibility to T. gambiense are directly correlated with the therapeutic property of normal serum against the animal parasites. They adduce evidence that serum-resistance is a "fixed" character of T. gambiense strains but is more labile in T. rhodesiense. Therefore, laboratory strains of the former are generally resistant, of the latter susceptible, to human serum, although both are resistant in human infections. These experimental findings are discussed in detail in regard to the epidemiology of human trypano-somiases of Africa, the identity of T. brucei and T. rhodesiense, antelope reservoirs of the latter, and the relation of both parasites to T. gambiense. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W.

B	MOHLER, J. R.								Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 1934.								Report of the Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, 1934.								52 pp.	52 pp.						1934	1934	In studies on the application of the complement-fixation test in the diagnosis of anaplasmosis, specific antigens were demonstrated in infected nymphs and adults of the tick, Rhipicephalus sangitineus, Latr., when tested against a serum from an active case of the disease, but not in uninfected adults. Specific antigens were demonstrated in engorged females of Boophilus annulatus, Say, obtained from cattle infected with tick-fever [Piroplasma bigeminum], when tested with the serum of an animal known to be affected with pure anaplasmosis and with the serum of a second animal known to be affected with piro-plasmosis but in which anaplasmosis could not be absolutely excluded. Infected larvae of this species showed similar antigenic value. Females of Aedes aegypti, L., that had fed on a carrier of anaplasmosis were permitted to engorge 9 days later on a susceptible splenectomised cow. Transmission of anaplasmosis did not occur as judged by failure of the test cow to react.In the campaign for the eradication of Boophilus annulatus, a further area of over 13, 000 square miles was released from Federal Quarantine and no areas were re-quarantined, so that the quarantined area has been further reduced from 12 per cent. [not one-twelfth as erroneously stated (R.A.E., B 22 57)] to 11 per cent. of its original size.Anaplasma marginale appears to be digested by the ticks, Dertna-centor variabilis, Say, and D. venustus, Banks (andersoni, Stiles). It could not be differentiated in the epithelial cells of the digestive tract of the tick in the stage that had ingested it, nor in the salivary glands of the next stage, which transmitted anaplasmosis to susceptible cattle. This suggests that the causal agent of the disease is ultramicroscopic in the tick. When examples of Boophilus annulatus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus infected with anaplasmosis were triturated in normal saline and injected intravenously into susceptible cattle, no disease and no immunity were produced, whether the emulsion was filtered through a Seitz filter or not. When ticks from the same lot were allowed to engorge, however, B. annulatus transmitted Piroplasma (Babesia) argentinum and R. sanguineus transmitted anaplasmosis.In the central zone of an area in Colorado in which a campaign for the eradication of cattle grubs [Hypoderma] is being carried out, the number of larvae per animal was 49 as compared with 5.1 for the previous year [cf. 22 57]. The failure to reduce the number to below about 5 larvae per animal is attributed to infestation from untreated herds. In a field experiment, about 3, 000 head of cattle were successfully treated by means of the small medicated rods [loc. cit.], but fatal malignant oedema developed later in 8 cases. Experiments to find an effective method of rendering the rods safe against anaerobic infection indicated that the addition of colloidal iodine to the formula prevents infection with malignant oedema. The result of further tests on farm and range sheep indicate that pine tar and pine-tar oils do not repel Oestrus ovis, L., nor prevent it from depositing its larvae in or around the nostrils of sheep.Insects serving as intermediate hosts of two parasitic worms that infest fowls are recorded [21 118]. A dung beetle, Aphodiusgranarius, L., a Staphylinid, Oxytelus sp., and young grasshoppers were found to be intermediate hosts of Hymenolepis variabilis, a cestode of crows, but both field and laboratory observations indicate that A. granarius does not serve as an intermediate host for H. cantaniana, a related cestode of poultry. Grasshoppers and cockroaches have been shown to be intermediate hosts of the crow stomach worm, Microtetrameres helix, with which pigeons were experimentally infected; and a Carabid, Celia muscula, Say, to be an intermediate host of Raillietina magninumida, a guinea-fowl cestode.A 5 per cent. mixture of orthophenylphenol in hydrated lime or kaolin dusted into the feathers of fowls effectively destroyed the louse, Eomenacanthus straminem, Nitzsch (Menopon biseriatum, Piag.). A 4 per cent. solution of pure coconut-oil soap in water killed Haematopinus adventicius chinensis, Fahrenh. (suis, auct.) on pigs. All lice and about 10 per cent. of their eggs were destroyed by a 50 per cent. dilution of acetone but a 12.5 per cent. dilution was apparently ineffective. Treatment of canine sarcoptic mange [Sarcoptes canis[Sarcoptes scabiei], Gerl.] with derris powder containing 5 per cent. rotenone gave promising results.																					CABI:19351000157

J	TENNENT, R. B.		NEW ZEALAND.						Report of the Department of Agriculture for the year ended 31 March 1958.								Report of the Department of Agriculture for the year ended 31 March 1958.								161 pp.	161 pp.						1958	1958	Animal Industry Division. Health of Livestock. <pounds>107, 595 compensation was paid for diseased animals slaughtered and <pounds>64, 170 for loss of production for cows and heifers condemned as reactors to the tuberculin test. The incidence of TUBERCULOSIS in cattle and pigs is given as: cows 9.2%, bullocks and heifers 0.8% and pigs 12.5%. Tuberculin tests in 169, 929 cattle showed 3% infected.Scheduled Diseases-Cases were TUBERCULOSIS 10, 903; JOHNE'S DISEASE 254; ACTINOMY-cosis and ACTINOBACILLOSIS 198; malignant growths or tumours (Epitheliomata) 108 animals condemned; ANTHRAX vaccination protected the animals on the five farms where cases were reported. BLACKLEG was controlled by vaccination; BOVINE MALIGNANT CATARRH-17 infected animals were condemned.INFECTIOUS LARYNGO-TRACHEITIS of poultry was diagnosed for the first time; SARCOPTIC MANGE in pigs occurred on 37 farms; SCRAPIE of sheep has not recurred; LICE of sheep are still prevalent.Non-scheduled diseases. BRUCELLOSIS-58, 225 calves were vaccinated with Br. abortus Strain 19. Br. ovis-Vaccination in sheep is used in control of outbreaks. Incidence of FACIAL ECZEMA was low. Liver damage was observed in numbers of lambs in Auckland. LEPTOSPIROSIS-vaccination appears to be effective. A few cases of LISTERELLOSIS were reported in sheep. There is no change in incidence of LIVER FLUKE on the east coast of North Island, where the disease is most prevalent.POISONING. Losses have been caused by arsenic, lead, zinc, slag top-dressing insufficiently washed off before grazing, dieldrin, sodium mono-fluoracetate, ragwort, tu tu (Coriaria ruscifolia), bracken, macrocarpa and ngaio (Myoporum lactum}. RYE-GRASS STAGGERS affected cattle on the east coast of North Island and in Taranaki. Some deaths occurred.The normal incidence of SALMONELLOSIS in sheep was aggravated by overstocking associated with facial eczema precautions. Losses from TETANUS of 1 to 2% in lambs after docking were reported. VIBRIOSIS appears to be the cause of most of the abortions and neo-natal mortality in the Manawatu, Horowhenua and Taranaki districts.HYDATID DISEASE. Losses from condemnation of livers amount to <pounds>11/2 million. Substantial progress is shown in the control measures for the eventual eradication of the tapeworm.Tapeworms in lambs have been recorded. "Treatment is impracticable in young lambs."There is a review of non-scheduled diseases in cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry which resemble those met with in the U.K.Noxious Wild Life includes Opossums, Wallabies, Deer, Rooks, and Canadian Geese. Rabbits are now reduced to very low levels. Sodium mono-fluoroacetate (1080) has been used for their destruction and also for the 15, 000 rooks reduced to 255 within a 15-mile radius of Christchurch.Animal Research Division. The Laboratories at Wallaceville and Ruakura examined 46, 722 specimens from 13, 131 cases for diagnosis.Research work. Sheep breeding investigations included "Fecundity in Ewes"; "Control of Time of Lambing and Lambing Percentage by Hormone Treatment" (results were variable); "Improving Fertility by Crossbreeding" (proved a success); "Bearing trouble in Ewes" ("The condition is not strongly inherited but affected ewes should be culled").Sheep Nutrition. RICKETS caused by green feeds. Salts of iron, manganese and aluminium added to a grain ration in the proportions present in green feeds, fed to rats, increased the severity of rickets. A daily supplement of phosphorus given to barley-fed g.pigs prevented rickets. These elements probably have an effect similar to calcium in that they reduce the availability of dietary phosphates. Treating green feed barley with a fertilizer containing Fe, Mg and A1 salts caused rickets among g.pigs fed with the barley from this source. Rickets-producing barley and short rotation rye-grass were lower in phosphorus than samples which did not produce rickets.Sheep Disease Investigations. FACIAL ECZEMA. Experiments to test a theory of the value of top-dressing of the suspected pastures with mixtures containing Cu2SO4 or cobalt sulfate showed practically no variation of liver damage from that of the controls on non-treated areas.BRUCELLOSIS IN SHEEP. In field trials to test the value of immunization of rams against Br. ovis infection (epididymitis), using 3 groups of 2-tooth rams (1) given adjuvant vaccine plus Br. abortus Strain 19, (2) given adjuvant vaccine alone, (3) non-vaccinated, the incidence of infection was, respectively, 1%, 7.2% and 21.3%. Investigation of the two-toothed rams and older rams six weeks after mating showed 659 adjuvant vaccine treated 6.7% infected, the non-vaccinated 788 two-tooth rams 16% and 2, 453 older rams 17.7%.Incidence of Intra-uterine Infection in Perinatal Mortality. In two groups totalling 211 lambs there was intra-uterine infection and/or dystokia in 114.Incidence of types of infection-in two groups totalling 122 lambs, 29 were Brucella ovis, 17 Vibrio fetus, 75 Toxoplasma and 1 streptococci.Experimentally ovine toxoplasma was transmitted to three months pregnant ewes by the s/c and i/v routes but not per Os or by intranasal instillation. No ewes became infected when the method was per vaginam at time of mating.VIBRIOSIS in ewes was a common cause of lamb mortality. In an experiment rams were infected by various routes (conjunctivally; preputially; orally); when mated none transmitted the infection.MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (White muscle disease) was prevalent in lambs in Canterbury and Otago. The main lesion was severe myocardial degeneration with minimal skeletal muscle lesions. Vitamin E is used in treatment and beneficial results are reported. Biochemical research is in progress.Cattle Diseases Projects. (1) Streptopen pessaries failed to cure an experimental infection of cows with V. fetus.(2) DIAGNOSIS OF V. fetus. An indirect haemagglutination test for the detection of antibodies to V. fetus has been developed. The test is more sensitive than the bacterial agglutination test and is equally sensitive in the. detection of antibody in vaginal mucus, which means earlier diagnosis.The incidence of BRUCELLOSIS in vaccinated herds during five years was 3.3%.LEPTOSPIROSIS. In young calves experimentally infected with L. pomona, treatment with streptomycin 1 g. or penicillin up to 106 units daily on the 4th, 5th and 6th days of the disease reduced the incidence of acute or fatal infection.Streptomycin 3 g. or 3 mega-units of penicillin given on three successive days to calves in the early stages of experimental leptospirosis delayed but did not entirely prevent the excretion of leptospires in the urine. When the dose was increased to streptomycin 4 g. on three successive days shortly after leptospires had appeared in the urine, no leptospires were subsequently detected in the urine, whereas they persisted in untreated carriers.VIRUS PNEUMONIA OF PIGS (V.P.P.). A pneumonia of pigs widespread in New Zealand was found to be virus pneumonia of pigs. Of 1, 000 sets of lungs from porkers 64.3% had typical lesions of V.P.P.ABORTION AND PERINATAL DEATHS. Lepto-spiral intra-uterine infection was the cause of deaths of piglets at full term in two sows. Leptospires were found in the kidneys of three piglets examined and in another case one of two litter mates that died had leptospires in the liver. These three cases are a small proportion of the total of perinatal deaths investigated. Leptospirosis is a relatively uncommon cause of perinatal mortality.Poultry Diseases. INFECTIOUS LARYNGO-IRACHEITIS was confirmed in May 1957 and has since been found to be endemic. The strain is a mild one which when inoculated into susceptible birds protects them against a virulent Australian strain.AVIAN TUBERCULOSIS. Avian type M. tuberculosis was isolated from cattle specimens and old fowls."Q" DISEASE OF CHICKENS has some resemblance to pullet disease. "The P.M. findings in experimentally produced potassium deficiency in chickens are almost identical with those seen in "Q" disease, except that in the latter the chickens are well grown." Clinically and post mortem it resembles avian monocytosis described in Australia "but the N.Z. chickens have not the same blood picture."Surface Application of Insecticides for Control of LICE and KEDS on sheep. Surface application of aldrin and dieldrin as dust or fine spray was effective in controlling lice and keds especially when applied up to three months after shearing. With a 3% dieldrin dust the initial kill was slow but the sheep were protected from lice for over six months. Spraying with 0.2% dieldrin (120 Ib. per sq. inch pressure) or with 0.125% dieldrin (15 Ib. per sq. in.) gave similar results.Trace Elements. Copper and Molybdenum. A fifth crop of lambs has been reared from ewes on pastures top-dressed to keep molybdenum at 8 p.p.m. In one instance bone fragility occurred in 20 lambs, but there was no ataxia. Ewe lambs have now been reared to breeding age on pasture with even higher Mo content and are being mated and no effect has been noted.Iodine: GOITRE on Thousand-headed Kale. The goitrogenic property of kale is probably not due to single substance. Use of radio-iodine shows that the antithyroid effect is partly due to an agent of the thiouracil type which blocks the organic binding of iodine, and that kale affects rabbits like thiocyanate rather than thiouracil. This hypothesis needs confirmation but is supported by the presence of thiocyanate in the milk of goats grazing on kale; this milk has an antithyroid action on rabbits. Since congenital goitre was produced in 1957 by the administration to pregnant ewes of both thiocyanate and thiouracil, it is possible both agents play a part in the congenital goitre due to kale.By comparing the radioactivity in the fetal thyroid 72 hours after injection of 131I with that of the maternal thyroid, it has been found that from 60 to 90 days of gestation the fetal accumulation rate is similar to the maternal but that between 90 and 120 days it increases to five times the maternal and remains at that level till parturition. This explains why lambs with grossly abnormal thyroids are born to ewes without clinical goitre.Toxicology. Laboratory rats did not become anaemic when fed kale from a field case of the disease, with deaths in sheep.RHODODENDRON POISONING in sheep-7 of 300 sheep died after eating cut rhododendron. Symptoms were slow, groaning expiration followed by short, rapid, gasping inspiration after excitation. After a few minutes breathing returned to normal, except that respiration was rapid. Much frothy saliva was present and the gait was ataxic. P.M. findings-congestion of the lungs with sub-pleural haematomas up to an inch in diameter. The deaths were spread over two weeks. There were considerable quantities of rhododendron leaves in the rumen of the first three sheep examined.METALDEHYDE POISONING in ducks. 9 of 21 ducks died after fits of trembling and ataxia. Crop contents from two were highly positive for metaldehyde on the sublimate from crop content and after conversion to acetaldehyde with dilute sulfuric acid.FODDER BEET POISONING IN SHEEP. In dosing trials two types of poisoning were obtained: a quick death within 11/2 days, and death from 4-15 days after dosing. Cane sugar trials emphasize that only the latter deaths can be directly attributed to the sugar content of the beet.About 8 Ib. of fresh beet of any potent variety per 100 Ib. liveweight is sufficient to kill. Beet with a sugar content of 5.3 g. sugar/Ib. liveweight is critical.-J. A. GRIFFITHS.																					CABI:19592202706		
J			Japan, The Horse Administration Bureau						Report on the Results obtained by the Special Committee for the Investigation of Infectious Anaemia among Horses.								Report on the Results obtained by the Special Committee for the Investigation of Infectious Anaemia among Horses.								59 pp.	59 pp.						1914	1914	The Special Committee, whose report this is, was appointed by the Japanese Government for the investigation of pernicious anaemia in horses in 1909. The personnel of the committee included representatives of the Horse Administration Bureau, the Imperial University at Tokyo, the Department of Agriculture, and the Army Veterinary Service.Although exact information was not obtainable, it appears to be probably that infectious anaemia among horses was unknown in Japan prior to 1895.The disease seems to be confined to Hokkaido, the northernmost island, and the north eastern part of Hondo, the main island. The southern portion of Japan is not invaded, because this portion of the country contains no pasture land, and it is among horses at pasture that the disease spreads.Exact information is also lacking regarding the annual losses from the disease. In the first year of any outbreak the number of cases is small. This is followed by a progressive increase during the following years until the disease may be so severe that the majority of the horses in the district die. The disease then slowly dies down again. Once infected a district remains infected for a number of years, cases having been recorded in some districts for more than ten consecutive years after the initial outbreak.In 1907, it was recognised that a number of deaths among the horses belonging to the Eemount Depot, which had been attributed to other causes in previous years, were in reality due to infectious anaemia. The maximum losses occurred in 1910 when a total of 500 horses died or were killed. Since that date the number of cases has decreased as a result of the preventive measures put into force. Since the virus is generally introduced by two-year-olds which have every appearance of being healthy at the time of purchase, but which afterwards prove to be infected, complete success in stamping out the disease among the remount animals has not yet been achieved, and fairly heavy losses still occur.It is while horses are at pasture that the majority contract the infection, animals very rarely becoming infected in stables. Unless death occurs soon after infection, the disease takes a chronic course. During the first few months after infection repeated Feb.rile attacks occur, but in cases in which the animal survives these gradually decrease in severity and finally cease.The virus was found to be capable of passing through a Berkefield filter, and all attempts to cultivate it outside the body failed. Experimental inoculations shewed that the virus is present in the blood and all the organs, and also in the urine and milk, but attempts to prove its presence in the faeces and sweat of infected animals failed.That the virus is protozal rather than bacterial in nature is indicated by the fact that the addition of 2.5 to 5 per cent. of sodium taurocholate to infective blood rendered it incapable of setting up the disease by inoculation.Heating the virus to 60°C. for an hour was found to destroy its virulence. Exposure to bright sunlight (Aug.ust) for two hours was also found to effect its destruction. Blood exposed out of doors from December to Apr.il, during which time the temperature was often as low as - 9°C., was proved to have retained its virulence.Blood was drawn from 21 horses at periods varying from 3 to 22 months after recovery and injected into healthy animals. All became infected with the exception of two which had received blood from horses which had recovered for three and thirteen months respectively. That these two animals were actually infected, although their blood failed to set up the disease, was proved by the inoculation of healthy horses with materials obtained from various organs when the animals were killed. Further experiments shewed that the blood may retain its virulence for periods ranging up to four years, but that the degree of virulence gradually diminishes.Experiments were carried out to test the relationship between affected parents and their offspring with regard to the disease.Blood drawn from four foals, the produce of infected mares, was injected into four healthy horses; one became infected, in two the symptoms produced were doubtful, and in the remaining one the result was negative. The injection of 30 to 100 cc. of milk from infected mares proved successful in three instances, but the milk of infected animals failed to set up the disease by ingestion.That the progeny of infected mares do not acquire the infection through the medium of the mare's milk was proved by the fact that the intravenous injection of blood from a foal before it had sucked its dam set up the disease.From this it is concluded that the infection is transmitted hereditarily.In the donkey the disease generally follows an acute course and death takes place suddenly.Among species of animals other than the equine the pig is the most susceptible to the virus. In the young goat and sheep a slight Feb.rile condition is produced, but calves, dogs, rabbits, guineapigs, and rats are insusceptible.Details of three experiments with pigs are given.In the first the subcutaneous inoculation of 10 cc. of virulent blood was followed on the 11th day by a rise of temperature to 40.2°C.There was interference with locomotion, loss of appetite, acceleration of the heart, frequent shivering fits and, finally, unconsciousness and death.The second pig inoculated died suddenly during a Feb.rile attack on the fifth day.The third pig was inoculated with 10 cc. of virulent blood, but failed to shew any evidence of infection. A month later 20 cc. of its blood set up infection in a horse, proving that the virus had been in the pig for that period.As already mentioned, infection occurs almost entirely while horses are at pasture, very occasional cases occurring in the stable. Experiments were therefore carried out to investigate the following points: Infectivity of the excreta of infected animals; infection through the alimentary canal; infection in the stable; and infection at pasture.Experiments shewed that the disease could be transmitted by inoculation with infected urine, but no evidence was obtained that the virus was contained in the faeces.It was also found that the disease could be produced experimentally 'by the administration of large quantities of infected urine (100 to 200 cc.) by the mouth.A number of experiments in which 11 healthy horses were stabled with infected animals proved that infection in the stable is of rather rare occurrence. These experiments were carried out during the winter when there were no flies.Principal importance attaches to the spread of the disease at pasture and in this connection the following points were investigated: The persistence of the virus in pasture during the winter; the manner in which infection occurs when healthy and diseased animals are kept together at pasture; and the relationship of blood-sucking insects to the disease.In connection with the first of these points experiments shewed that it was quite safe to put healthy horses on to a pasture where numerous cases had occurred during the previous years, but that if healthy horses are pastured with diseased animals or animals that are carriers of the virus there is a very great risk that the healthy animals will become infected. In fact, in the experiments quoted the healthy horses contracted the disease in every instance. The shortest period of incubation was 16 days.Although the virus is contained in the urine, it requires a large dose of this to produce infection experimentally and, further, the greater part of the urine passed soaks into the ground, that remaining on the top being disinfected by sunlight. Urine can therefore be excluded as the source of infection. This is also indicated by the fact that in stables, where the quantity of excreta is greater than in the open, the disease is far less commonly encountered.To test the question as to whether blood-sucking insects play any part in the transmission of the disease a number of experiments were carried out.In two experiments infected horses were kept with healthy ones in insect-proof enclosures for a period of some months. Two out of four healthy animals became infected from one diseased horse kept with them, and in the other experiment one out of two healthy horses became infected when kept with, four animals which were in a very advanced stage of the disease.This proved that the disease could be transmitted without the agency of insects, provided the place in which the animals were kept was highly infected, but the rate of infection could not be compared with what occurs in the open pasture.In the second series of experiments healthy and diseased horses were kept separate from each other in fenced areas separated from each other by a distance of about 15 yards. The animals could not mix with each other, but insects could pass freely between the batches.Three experiments were carried out on these lines. In the first, nine infected horses were kept in one enclosure while four healthy animals were kept in the adjacent one. All the healthy animals contracted the infection.In the second experiment five infected animals were placed in one enclosure. Two of these died shortly afterwards; one had a severe attack, and in the other two the symptoms were not very marked. Two healthy horses were kept in another enclosure during the whole season without becoming infected, but three out of four healthy animals placed in another enclosure, two at a time, became infected.The second experiment was repeated the following year with the exception that nine infected animals were used instead of five. In this instance all the healthy animals contracted the disease.Prom these experiments the conclusion is drawn that the disease can be transmitted without actual mixing of the diseased and healthy animals, and under conditions which exclude the intervention of insects other than those capable of flying.Experiments with flies, ticks, etc.Ticks. -Experiments showed that ticks taken from diseased horses and placed upon healthy horses never transmitted the infection.Bol-flies. -These are not blood-sucking insects, but to exclude the possibility of the virus being taken into the stomach with the larvae, a number of the latter were taken from the stomach of a diseased horse, crushed in a mortar, and injected into healthy animals. In no instance was the disease transmitted. Further, it is stated that during one year bot-flies were exterminated from all the horses before pasturing, and it was noticed that this had no effect upon the prevalence of the disease.Mosquitoes can be excluded, as they are found in the stables only, and not on the pastures.Experiments showed that although sand flies are energetic bloodsuckers they are not capable of transmitting the infection.Negative results were also obtained in experiments in which Stomoxys calcitrans was used.Tabanidae. -These flies are most abundant on the pastures, and energetically attack horses, and particular mention is made of the fact that the spread of the disease coincides with the appearance of this insect. It was found that the flies could not be kept alive for any length of time after they had been caught, and also that they could not be got to suck blood from the animals under experimental conditions.Although direct proof is not forthcoming, the Committee feel compelled to conclude that the disease is spread through the agency of these flies.Several species of horse-fly occur on the pastures where the experiments were carried out. The principal ones are the following: - Chrysops japonicus, Haematopota tristis, Tabanus chrysurus, Tabanus trigonus, Tabanus trigeminus, Tabanus luridus, Tabanus rufidens, etc.The lesions present in cases of the disease vary in degree according as the case is acute or chronic, but not in character. They are typically those of anaemia, and in chronic cases there is marked emaciation. The visible mucous membranes are pale, and frequently ecchymosed. The subcutaneous and intramuscular connective tissue contains a gelatinous or blood-stained exudate. The muscles are soft, and pale in colour. The alimentary tract shows no lesions save for catarrh in some cases.In acute cases, or after several attacks, the spleen may be two or three times the normal size. The capsule may show petechiae, and the pulp presents an appearance resembling that seen in cases of anthrax. In chronic cases the spleen is enlarged and firmer than normal. The capsule of the liver shows white patches of varying size and shape, these being particularly numerous between the lobules.In acute cases the kidneys are enlarged and softened, and covered with small petechiae.The lungs do not show any changes peculiar to the disease save oedema, but in some cases there is broncho-pneumonia.The blood is very watery and greatly reduced in amount. The lymphatic glands, both of the carcase and of the viscera, are enlarged and oedematous, and of a reddish brown colour.Histological examination reveals changes corresponding to the lesions: Anaemia, extravasations, degenerations of the parenchy-matous organs, and the presence of haemoglobin crystals. Special mention is made of an infiltration of small round cells into the paren-chymatous organs.The prominent symptoms of the disease are the irregular occurrence of fever and progressive anaemia. In the majority of cases the fever recurs several times in a month, but sometimes periods of a few weeks up to six months elapse between consecutive Feb.rile attacks.At the onset of the disease the temperature generally rises suddenly to 39° or 40° C., and after remaining at that level for a day or two suddenly falls again. In chronic cases the temperature remains for some time at a subfebrile level.During the febrile attacks the pulse rate may be as high as 90 per minute, but it maintains a moderate strength. In the last stages the pulse may be 120 and very weak. Very slight exertion causes an acceleration of the pulse and an increase in the force of the heart beats. Pulsation of the jugulars, which may extend half way up the neck, is frequently seen.There are little or no disturbances in connection with the lungs, save that exertion causes a distinct acceleration of the respirations, and towards the end froth may be passed through the nostrils owing to oedema of the lungs.During the Feb.rile attacks there is always albumen in the urine, the maximum being 10.5 per cent. During remissions and in chronic cases no albumen is found.In severe or chronic cases the blood clots very slowly, in some cases several days elapsing before the process occurs.Very few changes are observed in the morphology of the red blood corpuscles. There is a reduction in the number of white corpuscles, but this is not proportional to the decrease observed in the red corpuscles.All attempts to discover a means of diagnosis apart from clinical methods and the experimental inoculation of susceptible animals failed. A similar result attended all efforts to find a drug which would influence the course of the disease.Immunisation.- Seven recovered horses were treated with increasing doses of virulent serum and virulent blood in doses of from 2 cc. to 4, 000 cc. at intervals of three to six days. Three of these animals survived the treatment, two died of the disease during the course of the immunization, and in the remaining two cases treatment had to be stopped owing to the development of swellings at the seat of inoculation.The serum from these immunized horses was found to be of no value as a protective agent, but actually a source of danger, as it was proved to contain the virus of the disease, and to be capable of setting up infection in healthy horses.It was further found that if the material used as antigen contains blood corpuscles mixed with it a powerful isolysin is produced. Haemolysis occurred not only in infected animals which were treated with the serum, but also in a healthy horse, the count falling from 8, 000, 000 to 2, 700, 000 quite suddenly. Virulent serum heated to 60° C. for an hour was proved to be without protective properties.A number of experiments were carried out with goats, pigs, and calves with the object of ascertaining whether any attenuation could be produced by passing the virus through these animals. No evidence of attenuation could be obtained. In the case of the goat and the calf the virulence appeared to be destroyed.The addition of 2 per cent. carbolic acid to serum was not sufficient to destroy the virus in less than an hour. Chloroform and toluol failed to destroy it even after remaining in contact with it for 20 hours.The Report contains a summary of the laws and regulations laid down for the control of the disease.

An extensive collection of grasses and legumes from the Mediterranean region and from Africa is under investigation. An analysis of intervarietal and intravarietal differences is expected to elucidate the origin and subsequent evolution of Australian forms. Study of the performance of the varieties and strains in relation to environmental conditions in Australia and in the places of collection is also expected to provide comparative climatological data likely to be valuable in plant introduction.Fertile perennial allopolyploids of Phalaris tuberosa-Ph. minor (2n = 56) and Ph. caerule-scens-Ph. minor (2n = 42) have been induced by treating the F1 hybrids with colchicine. The hard-seeded condition in Trifolium subter-raneum is partly genetically conditioned. Some varieties, e.g. Dwalganup and Northam First Early, consistently produce a high percentage of hard seed; F2 progenies from crosses between these two varieties gave significantly greater proportions of hard seed than crosses such as Tallarook x Mount Barker. Tallarook, the standard variety in the coastal areas of New South Wales, often produces most of its growth and sets its seed too late in the season. By crossing it with Dwalganup and Northam First Early, earlier F2 segregates have been obtained. Varieties such as Dwalganup, Northam First Early and Pink-flowered display a lethal reaction to a virus within the group bean mosaic II but apparently possess some field resistance. The inheritance of the lethal reaction is being studied.Chromosome-doubling in T. subterraneum is associated with a considerable increase in susceptibility to mosaic. Only in the case of Dwalganup did the tetraploids exceed the diploids in dry-matter production by the end of the season. Seed production was reduced in the tetraploids but not to such an extent as to preclude their use.Some chromosome-doubled lines of T. repens show superiority over the ordinary form in vigour and ability to withstand adverse conditions; they produce good seed yields and are low in cyanogenic activity. Doubled lines of Medicago tribuloides merit further testing.Potato. The leaf-roll resistance of Bismark depends upon a virus-inactivating system (cf. PBA, Vol. XXIV, Abst. 439). Crosses have been effected to combine this type of resistance with resistance to viruses X and Y and to late blight.Flax. Work on the development of disease-resistant varieties continued.Tobacco. Selfed progenies of hybrids carrying the necrotic type of resistance to mosaic are under test. At temperatures above 75° F this type of resistance breaks down. One variety has exhibited resistance to the looper caterpillar (Plusia spp.); crosses have been made to determine whether this character is inherited.Linseed. Yield trials of Walsh x Punjab lines are in progress; some of the lines are superior to Walsh in yield and oil quality and combine the rust resistance of both parents. Investigations, on the degree of cross pollination were completed.Safflower. Selection has resulted in high-yielding strains, some of which have shown a 28-40% increase in oil content in comparative trials with unimproved varieties. Intervarietal crosses have been made for studying the inheritance of several characters.Tomato. The spotted-wilt resistance of Rey de los Tempranos [King of the Earlies] is being incorporated in commercial-type hybrids, possessing resistance to Fusanum wilt and nematode. The spotted-wilt resistance of this variety is expressed by the ability to produce healthy shoots if infected and is apparently recessive.The F1 hybrids SA Dwarf Red (C strain) x Vetomold and Tatinter x Vetomold are suitable for greenhouse cultivation and combine high yields, leaf-mould resistance and other desirable features.

V. fetus cultures were introduced into the vagina a year before heifers came to first service to determine whether immunity will develop from such an exposure. A killed culture was used in a control group. An antigen prepared from 5-day cultures on blood agar is being studied. FOOT ROT, Fusiformis nodosus, has been grown in liquid media prepared from autolysates of pancreas supplemented with protein hydrolysate from wool, hoof or casein or with the enzymatic hydrolysate, Neopeptone. Pro-teases from F. nodosus digest sheep hoof and disintegrate frozen sections of hoof. Intra-epidermal injection of protease produces ulcers in the skin. Injection of F. nodosus s/c did not protect against infection, but circulating antibodies were detected. Cases of foot "scald" were observed in the field; none developed into foot rot. Smears from the lesions showed a bacterial flora similar to that in classical foot rot and an organism similar to F. nodosus was isolated. "Scald" lesions were reproduced by transferring material from natural cases to the scarified interdigital skin. Restoration of the protectiveness, against Dermatophilus dermatonomus, of the film of sebaceous secretion after damage by an ether wash was not interfered with by pregnancy or the administration of ethynyl oestradiol, although both caused a slight reduction in the secretion. It is thus unlikely that oestrogenic subterranean clover predisposes to outbreaks of MYCOTIC DERMATITIS. Coarse-wooled sheep do not have a complete protective film of sebum and are always susceptible to infection. New-born Merino lambs were not fully resistant until 1-4 weeks old. Zoospores of D. dermatonomus did not survive long in soil. Infections in shearing wounds persisted for only two weeks in adult and for four weeks in young sheep. Long acting penicillin was not satisfactory in treatment. Spraying with 0.25% zinc sulfate after shearing reduced the incidence of infected wounds. Studies on PLEUROPNEUMONIA of cattle include micro-bial metabolism and immunochemistry-polysaccha. ride antigen, serological relation between Myco-plasma mycoides and other PPLO; comparisons of "broth vaccines" and "egg vaccines"; herd susceptibility or variations in vaccine potency to which differences in reactions are usually attributed, were not necessarily responsible; duration of immunity tends to be shorter when animals are constantly exposed to active cases; lung lesions occur in animals vaccinated with "egg vaccine" but not in those vaccinated with "broth vaccine"; failure to produce a clinical response in "carrier" animals when inoculated subcutaneously with M. mycoides; a search for species other than M. mycoides which may have immunizing properties; an elaborate experiment to demonstrate that the risk of spread by infected fodder, yards, trucks or stables is negligible.Studies on virus diseases indicate that BOVINE PAPULAR STOMATITIS virus belongs to the Pox virus group; failure of a Miyagawanella organism from BOVINE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS to infect lambs although complement-fixing antibody is produced; cytopathic agents were isolated from faeces of cattle with VIRUS DIARRHOEA; isolation of papular stomatitis virus from oral lesions in a calf with diarrhoea; failure to isolate cytopathic agents from cases of BOVINE MALIGNANT CATARRH; isolation of Miyagawanella organisms from faeces of apparently healthy cattle, from the trachea of a calf and from a bull with pneumonia; isolation of an organism indistinguishable from M. bovis from cases of encephalitis; circumstantial evidence that M, bovis may be the cause of a transmissible serositis; investigation of a suspected virus disease of cattle, "T DISEASE" with symptoms of bilateral ocular discharge, lameness, weight loss, harsh dry cough, coronitis and erosion of muzzle and interdigital epithelium, but not diarrhoea; "virus" pneumonia in sheep which yielded a cytopathic agent.Two lines of homozygous fowls have been produced and are used in studies on mechanisms of antibody production.Heavy infestations with Linognathus ovillus were seen on the legs as well as on the face of sheep. Mortality of the eggs of Damalinia ovis[Bovicola ovis] occurs chiefly just after they are laid or at hatching. High humidity may prevent hatching. Microclimate governs the distribution and reproduction of D. equi on the horse. High temperatures in summer may reduce the population. Amblyomma triguttatum was divided into four sub-species and the systematics of Haemaphysails are being examined. By a modified c.f. test Babesia argentina antibodies could be detected for some months after organisms were no longer present in blood; persistence of infection with B. argentina was detected, by inoculation into splenectomized calves, in only one of 12 animals after c.f. antibodies ceased to be detectable; differentiation of the stages of B. bigemina in Boophilus microplus, except the form assumed during the first 24 hours; transmission of B. argentina within four days of the application of larval ticks; field surveys suggested that the persistence of Babesia in the blood is due to continuous re-infection; infections resulting from a single tick-transmitted infection persisted at least nine months; staining techniques and appearance of cells; effective treatment with "Diam-pron".Radioactive chromium was used to show that each Fasciola hepatica removed up to 0.075 ml. blood in 2 hours. Exposure of metacercariae to 2, 500 to 3, 000 r resulted in death of the young flukes soon after migration through the liver began, Sheep appeared to be more suitable hosts than cattle for F. hepatica. Experimental infections in calves had pre-patent periods of 62-84 days. Egg counts increased rapidly, then decreased rapidly and persisted at low levels. Survival and hatching of F, hepatica eggs were seen during the winter, and the incubation period varied from 21 to 100 days during different times of the year. Hexachlorophene (7 mg. /lb.) was effective against F. hepatica in sheep and cattle. Although tetrachlorodifluoroethane ("Freon 112") at 0.1 g./lb. appeared safe and effective against F. hepatica in sheep, this dose was fatal in 6 of 20 dairy cows. There are differences in activity between the symmetrical and asymmetrical women of the compound. In vitro studies of CCI4 toxkity suggested that death might be prevented by stimulating pyridine nucleotide synthesis to effect the replacement of pyridine nucleotides lost from cells or by preventing the loss of pyridine nudeotides, especially from the mitochondria. In rats lethal effects were prevented by prior treatment with nicotinic acid or tryptophane, or by antioxidant compounds. In sheep simultaneous dosing with nicotink acid and 50 ml. OC14 reduced mortality. Sheep fed lucerne chaff were more susceptible to CC14 poisoning than those on a cereal chaff and grain ration. The only intermediate host of F. hepatica in Australia and New Zealand is now designated Lymnata lomeniosa. Ultra-violet fluorescent patterns of chromatograms of mucus of L. lomeniosa from widely separated regions in Australia did not show appreciable differences. The regional distribution of L. tomentosa in Queensland appears to be related to the pH of surface waters, infections of F. hepatica could not be established in snails previously infected with Echinostomes which were common in the field. Irradiated Trichostrongylus colubriformis larvae were more effective in producing resistance in sheep than were irradiated Haemonchus coniortus. In trials a mixture of irradiated larvae of both species did not afford strong protection against natural infections. Adult and 4th stage H. coniortus transferred surgically from susceptible to resistant sheep continued to develop. Irradiated larvae produced self-cure in 14 of 39 sheep, normal larvae were effective in 9 of 12 sheep, A dose of 200 normal larvae stimulated self-cure. A worm-free lamb was sensitized by injections of exsheathing fluid and showed high titres in c.f. and diffusion tests, but remained susceptible to challenge. Two doses of irradiated H. coniortus larvae stimulated a degree of resistance which persisted for 15 months. The duration of infections of Oesophag. ostomum radiatum in calves was regulated by treatment with trichlorphpn ("Neguvon"). No resistance developed from an infection of 10 days' duration, and only slight resistance from infections of 24 days' duration. When worms were removed during peak egg production (8-10 weeks after infection) challenge showed some resistant, some susceptible. When the worms were removed a few weeks after egg counts had declined the calves were strongly resistant. When adult worms were transferred surgically to susceptible calves resistance was related to the number of worms. Transfer of adult worms from susceptible to resistant calves resulted in variable survival. Transfer of 4th stage larvae from a resistant to a susceptible calf resulted in continued development of the worms, which suggests that the resistant state which causes challenge doses of worms to be eliminated in the 4th stage must be mediated by some change in the environment in which the larvae lie rather than by a direct effect on the worm. Oe. radiatum larvae exposed to 40, 000 r of X-irradiation completed the tissue phase but few survived to the adult stage; larvae exposed to 60, 000 r completed the tissue phase but did not survive when they migrated to the lumen. When calves immunized by laboratory infections were exposed in the field, resistance to Oe. radiatum was partial, and practically nil to Cooperia spp. When calves were hyperimmun-ized and then exposed to malnutrition on worm-free pastures they lost weight, but resistance to challenge persisted. In natural infections fluctuations in the c.f. reaction were related to the egg count and antibodies persisted longer in calves which were recovering and had low egg counts. Surgical transfer of adult Oe. radiatum induced antibody production. Splenectomized calves resistant to Oe. radiatum produced antibodies after challenge. Splenectomy before challenge combined with reticuloendothelial blockade by Evans blue appeared to aggravate the clinical reaction. Studies on the ecology and epidemiology of helminthoses in cattle showed that the persistence of immature Oe. radiatum in the bowel wall may necessitate modifications of a rotational grazing system based on the behaviour and longevity of larvae in pastures and on a single treatment with "Neguvon" before removal to clean pastures. A second treatment 3 weeks after the move from infected pastures was effective. Calves infected with Oe. radiatum showed depression of digestibility of dry matter and nitrogen during the 7th week, and slight to moderate anaemia and hypoproteinaemia. Sheep in Victoria showed late spring and early summer rises with H. contortus, Trichostrongylus spp., Ostertagia spp., Oe. venulosum and Chabertia ovina, with a second rise in autumn. Heavy infections were often carried into the winter, and declined in the spring when the sheep were a year old. In some years outbreaks of haemonchosis occurred in late summer-early autumn. At Oberon (Central Tablelands of N.S.W.) lambs born in spring showed increasing worm burdens with Trichostrongylus spp., Ostertagia spp., and Nematodirus spp., and smaller numbers of H. contortus, Oe. venulosum and C. ovina, in early summer, reaching peaks in late summer and early autumn. Monthly treatments with phenothiazine, bephenium hydroxynaphthoate, thia-bendazole or methyridine improved weight gains and more lambs reached a marketable weight in a given time. After monthly treatments with 2.5 g./100 Ib. "Neguvon", cattle were resistant to a challenge dose of Oe. radiatum larvae, but not to H. placet. Absorption and excretion of phenothiazine is dependent on particle size. Increased absorption could account for the increase in photosensitization and toxic effects recorded after the introduction of the finer material. Absorption was much less when injected into the abomasum than into the rumen. A highly purified but relatively coarse sample (7, 000 cm2/g.) was less effective than a finer (12, 000 cm2/ g.) but less highly purified one against T. colubriformis. When the dose of the coarser material was increased to provide a dose area (as cm2/g.) similar to that provided by the finer material, comparable activity was attained. Deaths occurred in sheep on low protein diet when drenched with phenothiazine. Although values for reduced glutathione in the ery-throcytes were almost zero on the poor diet, phenothiazine did not cause a haemolytic anaemia. Biochemical studies on such sheep showed disturbances of oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous low level dosage of phenothiazine of ewes resulted in reduced worm burdens in lambs. Pasture contamination was reduced mainly as a result of inhibition of larval development which was proportional to the amounts of phenothiazine ingested, about 0.5 g. per head per day for ewes at 8 per acre and 0.25 g. for ewes at 4 per acre. The egg counts of Nematodirus spp. were higher in the lambs in the groups where phenothia-zine-salt mixture was available. Quinazine toluene sulphonate (100-150 mg./kg.) was more effective against mature H. contortus, Oe. columbianum and T. colubriformis, than against immature worms. Diethylcarbamazine (40-80 mg./kg.) by mouth was moderately effective against T. colubriformis. Intramuscular injections were ineffective. Dpwco 132 was effective against H. contortus and Trichostrongylus spp. but had variable activity against Oe. columbianum. When an emulsion of this compound was poured on the back of sheep, egg counts of H. contortus were reduced in a few sheep. Methyridine (200 mg./kg.) was highly effective against Trichostrongylus spp., Nematodirus spp. and Cooperia spp., but gave variable results against H. contortus and Ostertagia spp. When the drug was swallowed into the abomasum after pre-swabbing with copper sulfate, efficiency against the abomasal species was increased, but toxic effects, with a few deaths, occurred. Efficiency in field trials was lower than in laboratory trials. In a field trial lambs treated monthly with methyridine made greater weight gains than those treated with phenothiazine. Thiabendazole (50 mg./kg.) appeared to be the most effective an-thelmintic against the common gastro-intestinal nematodes of sheep yet examined. A mixture of an organic phosphorus compound and phenothiazine appeared to have additive effects in laboratory trials, but in field trials efficiency was low. In cattle subcutaneous injections of "Neguvon", 1 g./100 lb., were effective against Oe. radiatum. Bephenium hydroxynaphthoate was effective against Oe. radiatum and Cooperia spp. at 10 g./100 lb., and against H. placei at 15 g./100 lb. Thiabendazole was effective against H. placei and Nematodirus spp. at 2.5 g./100 lb., and against Oe. radiatum at 5 g./ 100 lb., but effects against Cooperia spp. were variable.Experiments are in progress to determine whether ataxia in lambs and "straight-steely" wool are produced only in copper-deficient animals when some other factor is also operating. Repeated doses of potassium cyanide did not precipitate ataxia in copper-deficient lambs. There was no evidence that selenium was concerned in the production of crimp in the fleece.Implants of testosterone propionate are most useful in the prevention and treatment of POSTHITIS in wethers. Treated wethers had increased weight gains and produced more wool, horn growth was also stimulated. A satisfactory regimen is 2 or 3 implants, in autumn and early spring, or autumn, winter and early spring at a dose of 60 to 90 , g.The pyrrolizidine alkaloids of Heliotropium europaeum were studied in relation to pathogenic changes in liver tissues and to their effects on mitochondrial metabolism in rat tissues in vitro. Heliotrope poisoning was seen in cattle. H. europaeum appears to be as harmful as Senecio jacobaea. Metabolic block in the brain tissue may be responsible for the clinical signs of PHALARIS STAGGERS.Other matters of animal health interest include physiological basis of hybrid vigour, copper supplementation of beef cattle, adaptation of cattle to tropical environments, beta-globulin polymorphism in cattle, characteristics of erythrocytes, zebu-cross dairy herd, fertility in rams and ewes, pregnancy toxaemia, vitamin A deficiency and hypothyroioUsm in pregnancy, cystic endometrial hyperplasia in ewes, fleece shedding due to feeding of Leucaenia glauca.The report has lists of personnel and of papers published during 1960-61.-H.
