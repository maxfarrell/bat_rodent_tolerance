YOKV belongs to the Entebbe bat virus group of vector unknown group within the genus Flavivirus and family Flaviviridae. To detect antibodies against YOKV, we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using biotinylated anti-bat IgG rabbit sera. Serological surveillance was conducted with samples collected in the Philippines and the sera supplied from Malaysia. One of the 36 samples from the Philippines (2.7%) and 5 of the 26 samples from Malaysia (19%) had detectable ELISA antibodies. In the experimental infections, no clinical signs of disease were observed. Moreover, no significant viral genome amplification was detected. These findings revealed that YOKV replicates poorly in the fruit bat, suggesting that fruit bats do not seem to serve as an amplifying host for YOKV. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Dodet, B; Fooks, AR; Miller, T; Tordo, N		Experimental infection of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) with West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV)								TOWARDS THE ELIMINATION OF RABIES IN EURASIA		Developments in Biologicals		131				327	337						2008	2008	Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), either recently captured individuals or survivors from previous experimental infection with Irkut virus (IRKV), were inoculated with West Caucasian bat virus (WCBV), intramuscularly into the masseter (n=7) or neck (n=8) muscles, or orally (n=6). Three bats inoculated into the neck muscles developed rabies and died between days 10 and 18. Viral RNA was detected in a number of tissues but isolation was successful only from the brain. An oral swab of one of these bats was also PCR-positive, but the isolation attempt failed. Brains, salivary glands and swabs from the survivors (six months observation) were negative, as well as all blood pellets collected. Therefore, no suggestions for a carrier state or viremia were obtained. In four surviving bats inoculated in the masseter muscles, WCBV-neutralizing antibodies were detected up to the end of experiment. The absence of antibodies in the three rabid bats may be the result of shorter incubation periods. Bats infected orally neither died nor responded serologically. In the bats previously infected with IRKV, IRKV-neutralizing antibodies were detected as well, up to the end of observation (12 months after IRKV challenge), even if they were not boosted by WCBV inoculation.

As a first step, Chicken Embryo Related (CER) cell monolayers infected with the BRSV-25-BR strain isolated in Brazil were used for antigen production. Then, the infected lung and tracheal tissues of female balb/c mice were collected on 3, 5, 7 and 10 days post-infection and submitted to both techniques. Primers specific to F and G genes that amplify fragments of 481 bp and 371 bp, respectively, were used. The BRSV detection was not successful in all of the animals tested. The genomic fragment of the G gene from the organs of some infected mice on all analyzed post-infection days was amplified. However, in the RT-nested-PCR corresponding to the F gene, it was not possible to observe any amplified fragment. This was probably due to the higher sensitivity of the developed technique to amplify the fragment corresponding to the G gene compared to the F gene. Moreover, only three of the lungs collected five days post-infection were positive by immunohistochemistry. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study reporting bovine respiratory syncytial virus detection in balb/c mice after experimental inoculation.

Several strains of the virus were isolated in South and Central Americas from several hosts, such as humans, wild animals, including nonhuman primates, wild rodents and mosquitoes as well as mice used as sentinels. The virus is able to cause febrile disease in humans. Here we describe for the first time pathologic and biochemical findings in golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) infected with the prototype GMAV. Blood and organs of infected and control animals were collected every 24 h after infection from the 1st to the 7th day post infection (dpi) and at 21 dpi when experiment was ended. The tissues were processed for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The blood and serum were used to determine viremia and biochemical markers plus to detect anti-GMAV antibodies. The viremia was early detected already on the 1st dpi and it was no longer detected on the 3rd dpi. Total anti-GMAV antibodies were detected from the 6th dpi. Hepatic markers as ALT of infected animals were increased and showed statistically significant difference in comparison with control animals, indicating damage of the liver; indeed the liver was the most affected organ, but other organs presented lesions and positive GMAV immunostaining as brain, lung, liver, spleen, and kidney. Our findings indicate that golden hamsters are a good animal model for experimental infection of the GMAV.																					WOS:000487766800034	31326560

The Egyptian fruit bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) has been identified as a natural reservoir based most-recently on the repeated isolation of MARY directly from bats caught at two locations in southwestern Uganda where miners and tourists separately contracted MHF from 2007-08. Despite learning much about the ecology of MARY through extensive field investigations, there remained unanswered questions such as determining the primary routes of virus shedding and the severity of disease, if any, caused by MARY in infected bats. To answer these questions and others, we experimentally infected captive-bred R. aegyptiacus with MARY under high (biosafety level 4) containment. These experiments have shown infection profiles consistent with R. aegyptiacus being a bona fide natural reservoir host for MARY and demonstrated routes of viral shedding capable of infecting humans and other animals.

Infection of E. fuscus was moderate (total, 55-75%). There was no evidence of transmission to in-contact cage mates. Incubation periods for Irkut virus infection were significantly shorter (p < 0.05) than for either Aravan or Khujand virus infections. In turn, quantification of viral RNA by TaqMan PCR suggests that the dynamics of Irkut virus infection may differ from those of Aravan/Khujand virus infection. Although infectious virus and viral RNA were detected in the brain of every rabid animal, dissemination to non-neuronal tissues was limited. Levels of viral RNA in brain of Aravan/Khujand virus-infected bats was significantly correlated with the number of other tissues positive by TaqMan PCR (p < 0.05), whereas no such relationship was observed for Irkut virus infection (where viral RNA was consistently detected in all tissues other than kidney). Infectious virus was isolated sporadically from salivary glands, and both infectious virus and viral RNA were obtained from oral swabs. The detection of viral RNA in oral swabs suggests that viral shedding in saliva occurred < 5 days before the onset of clinical disease.																					WOS:000240723300010	16705370

A number of studies were conducted to validate a reliable animal model for the infection, since BRSV inoculation on the natural host is costly and often unsuccessful. Unfortunately, after inoculation of BRSV in Balb/C mice, viral replication may be detected; however, evident pathological alterations are absent on the experimentally infected animals. In order to establish a mice model that could be used further for preliminary studies of pathological and immunological aspects of BRSV infection, three mice inbred lineages (Balb/C, A/J and C57BL6), possessing different genetic backgrounds, were tested about its susceptibility to the inoculation with BRSV. Animals were inoculated through the nasal and ocular routes and were observed after inoculation. At 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) animals were necropsied and virological (virus isolation and viral nucleic acid amplification) as well as histopathological examinations were performed. A/J and C57BL6 showed interstitial pneumonia, when compared to the Balb/C group. These findings shows that mice may constitute a suitable model for the study of BRSV infections, depending on the mice strain used for experimental inoculations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental Inoculation of Egyptian Rousette Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) with Viruses of the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus Genera								VIRUSES-BASEL				7	7			3420	3442		10.3390/v7072779				JUL 2015	2015	The Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is a natural reservoir for marburgviruses and a consistent source of virus spillover to humans. Cumulative evidence suggests various bat species may also transmit ebolaviruses. We investigated the susceptibility of Egyptian rousettes to each of the five known ebolaviruses (Sudan, Ebola, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Reston), and compared findings with Marburg virus. In a pilot study, groups of four juvenile bats were inoculated with one of the ebolaviruses or Marburg virus. In ebolavirus groups, viral RNA tissue distribution was limited, and no bat became viremic. Sudan viral RNA was slightly more widespread, spurring a second, 15-day Sudan virus serial euthanasia study. Low levels of Sudan viral RNA disseminated to multiple tissues at early time points, but there was no viremia or shedding. In contrast, Marburg virus RNA was widely disseminated, with viremia, oral and rectal shedding, and antigen in spleen and liver. This is the first experimental infection study comparing tissue tropism, viral shedding, and clinical and pathologic effects of six different filoviruses in the Egyptian rousette, a known marburgvirus reservoir. Our results suggest Egyptian rousettes are unlikely sources for ebolaviruses in nature, and support a possible single filovirussingle reservoir host relationship.

Hitherto, neither human nor animal infection by this virus has been reported. Nonetheless, its close relationship to another paramyxovirus, the Menangle virus which had caused diseases in humans and pigs [Philbey, A.W., Kirkland, P.D., Ross, A.D., Davis, R.J., Gleeson, A.B., Love, R.J., Daniels, P.W., Gould, A.R., Hyatt, A.D., 1998. An apparently new virus (family Paramyxoviridae) infectious for pigs, humans, and fruit bats. Emerg. Infect. Dis. 4, 269-271], raises the possibility that it may be potentially pathogenic. In this study, mice were experimentally infected with Tioman virus by intraperitoneal and intracerebral routes, and the cellular targets and topographical distribution of viral genome and antigens were examined using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The possible association between viral infection and apoptosis was also investigated using the TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry to FasL, Caspase-3, Caspase-8, Caspase-9 and bcl-2. The results showed that Tioman virus inoculated intracerebrally was neurotropic causing plaque-like necrotic areas, and appeared to preferentially replicate in the neocortex and limbic system. Viral i infection of inflammatory cells was also demonstrated. TUNEL and Caspase-3 positivity was found in inflammatory cells but not in neurons, while FasL, Caspase-8 and Caspase-9 were consistently negative. This suggests that neuronal infection was associated with necrosis rather than apoptosis. Moreover, the data suggest that there may be an association between viral infection and apoptosis in inflammatory cells, and that it could, at least in part, involve Caspase-independent pathways. Bcl-2 was expressed in some neurons and inflammatory cells indicating its possible role in anti-apoptosis. There was no evidence of central nervous system infection via the intraperitoneal route.

Sequencing of a 400 nucleotides coding region of the nucleoprotein and of a major part of the G-protein ectodomain encoding region of the newly isolated virus, revealed a very high similarity with European Bat Lyssavinus subtype la (EBL-1a). For characterisation of the recently isolated lyssavirus in frugivorous zoo bats, 16 frugivorous bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) of the same colony and 80 mice were experimentally infected with the Rousettus isolate or with a well defined EBL-1a strain isolated from a Dutch insectivorous bat (Eptesicus serotinus). Inoculation viruses were titrated in mice to determine LD50's Of both isolates. Clinical signs of inoculated bats were recorded during 6 weeks. After showing neurological signs or at the end of the experimental infection all animals were euthanized. During the experimental infection sera and various tissues of inoculated bats were collected. Immunoassays, mouse inoculation tests (MIT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were employed for detection of lyssavirus specific antibodies, antigen or RNA. Five bats inoculated with the Rousettus isolate and 2 bats inoculated with the Eptesicus isolate showed neurological signs. The remaining 9 bats survived and cleared the virus; at least under the detection limit of the used assays. Despite a much higher pathogenicity of the Rousettus isolate observed in mice, LD25's in bats were quite the same for the 2 isolates. The pathogenicity of both isolates suggested that like many other mammals, Rousettus aegyptiacus bats could be victims of lyssavirus infection besides reservoir hosts of infectious EBL1a. There was no significant difference in detecting the different lyssavirus isolates in Rousettus aegyptiacus bats. An employed immunoperoxidase staining (LP) method was very useful for sensitive detection and localization of lyssavirus antigen in histologic preparates.

Bats (n = 35) were captured in the wild and quarantined prior to experimental infection. No rabies antibodies were detected by rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT) prior to infection. Three doses of rabies virus (RV) and three different routes of infection were used. One out of 35 bats died without showing any clinical signs at day 14 and was positive for rabies. None of the 34 other bats showed clinical signs for rabies, but high antibody titers were detected post-inoculation, suggesting either innate immune response to the vampire bat rabies virus or possible pre-exposure to RV and inoculation leading to a booster effect. Rabies virus was detected by hemi-nested RT-PCR (hnRT-PCR) in the brain (n= 3), stomach (n= 1) of bats that were negative by immunofluorescence and that survived rabies infection. The bat that died on day 14 was positive by hnRTPCR on the brain, heart and liver. These results suggest that either previous non-lethal exposure to RV or natural low susceptibility to vampire bat viruses somehow protected Artibeus intermedius from clinical rabies infection leading to a marginal lethality effect on this bats species population in the wild.

Because wild and domestic rodents have anti-HEV antibodies, they are considered potential reservoirs of HEV. In the current study, Mongolian gerbils were experimentally infected with swine hepatitis E virus and the effects of this infection were investigated. After inoculation with HEV, the liver-to-body weight ratio increased at 7 dpi. Mongolian gerbils demonstrated significant increase (p < 0.05) in Aspartate Transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and total bilirubin (T-BIL) concentrations in the sera, and HEV IgG was detected at 21 days post-inoculation (dpi). Real-time PCR revealed that the copies of HEV RNA in the liver were detected at 7 dpi, and peaked at 28 dpi at a concentration of 7.73 logs g(-1). Using both light and electron microscopy, hepatic lesions were observed in the HEV inoculated animals. In the experimental group, characteristic viral hepatitis lesions were prominent in the liver. HEV antigen was detected in the liver by immunohistochemistry, and HEV ORF3 antigen was detectable in liver by Western blot. These results clearly demonstrate that viral load of HEV in livers was dynamic, and ultrastructural hepatic injury in HEV infected Mongolian gerbils and anti-HEV IgG positive seroconversion were observed during infection.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				39	5			342	345						2017	2017	Pseudorabies virus (PRV) has the ability to infect neuronal cells and synaptic transmission, which could be applied as a kind of new tracer for neuronal cell studies. To determinate the PRV distribution in artificially infected mouse, we established a PRV-infected rat model to analyze the viral distribution in infected animals. The distribution of PRV in various tissues of infected rats was detected by immunehistochemistry (IHC) assay and was compared with the conventional PCR. The results showed that the brain, lung, spleen and kidney of infected rats could be detected by IHC assay at 72, 78, 84, 96, 104, 108 hrs post infection. And the detected rates were 50% by PCR and 36% by IHC, respectively, and the coincidence rate of the two assays was 72%.

Virus was cultured from their blood and oropharynx several days before death; at necropsy, most of the organs tested contained monkeypox virus. Marked hepatic and splenic necrosis were observed,. along with mild inflammatory changes in the lungs. After intranasal (IN) infection, the primary pathologic changes were in the lungs and pleural cavity. Some of the IN infected animals (40%) survived, and monkeypox virus could be cultured from their nasal discharge and oropharynx for <= 22 days. Ulcerative lesions also developed on the lips, tongue, and buccal mucosa of the surviving animals. Our findings support an earlier report, which suggested that infected prairie dogs can transmit monkeypox virus by respiratory and mucocutaneous contact with susceptible animals and persons.

J	Dhondt, Kevin P.; Horvat, Branka								Henipavirus Infections: Lessons from Animal Models								PATHOGENS				2	2			264	287		10.3390/pathogens2020264				JUN 2013	2013	The Henipavirus genus contains two highly lethal viruses, the Hendra and Nipah viruses and one, recently discovered, apparently nonpathogenic member; Cedar virus. These three, negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, are hosted by fruit bats and use EphrinB2 receptors for entry into cells. The Hendra and Nipah viruses are zoonotic pathogens that emerged in the middle of 90s and have caused severe, and often fatal, neurologic and/or respiratory diseases in both humans and different animals; including spillover into equine and porcine species. Development of relevant models is critical for a better understanding of viral pathogenesis, generating new diagnostic tools, and assessing anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. This review summarizes available data on several animal models where natural and/or experimental infection has been demonstrated; including pteroid bats, horses, pigs, cats, hamsters, guinea pigs, ferrets, and nonhuman primates. It recapitulates the principal features of viral pathogenesis in these animals and current knowledge on anti-viral immune responses. Lastly it describes the recently characterized murine animal model, which provides the possibility to use numerous and powerful tools available for mice to further decipher henipaviruses immunopathogenesis, prophylaxis, and treatment. The utility of different models to analyze important aspects of henipaviruses-induced disease in humans, potential routes of transmission, and therapeutic approaches are equally discussed.

Identification of an Unclassified Paramyxovirus in Coleura afra: A Potential Case of Host Specificity								PLOS ONE				9	12					e115588	10.1371/journal.pone.0115588				DEC 31 2014	2014	Bats are known to harbor multiple paramyxoviruses. Despite the creation of two new genera, Aquaparamyxovirus and Ferlavirus, to accommodate this increasing diversity, several recently isolated or characterized viruses remain unclassified beyond the subfamily level. In the present study, among 985 bats belonging to 6 species sampled in the Belinga caves of Gabon, RNA of an unclassified paramyxovirus (Belinga bat virus, BelPV) was discovered in 14 African sheathtailed bats (Coleura afra), one of which exhibited several hemorrhagic lesions at necropsy, and viral sequence was obtained in two animals. Phylogenetically, BelPV is related to J virus and Beilong virus (BeiPV), two other unclassified paramyxoviruses isolated from rodents. In the diseased BelPV-infected C. afra individual, high viral load was detected in the heart, and the lesions were consistent with those reported in wild rodents and mice experimentally infected by J virus. BelPV was not detected in other tested bat species sharing the same roosting sites and living in very close proximity with C. afra in the two caves sampled, suggesting that this virus may be host-specific for C. afra. The mode of transmission of this paramyxovirus in bat populations remains to be discovered.																					WOS:000347119100045	25551455	
J	Neill, William A.; Kading, Rebekah C.								Viral Ecology and Natural Infection Dynamics of Kaeng Khoi Virus in Cave-Dwelling Wrinkle-Lipped Free-Tailed Bats (Chaerephon plicatus) in Thailand								DISEASES				9	4					73	10.3390/diseases9040073				DEC 2021	2021	Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV; Order: Bunyavirales), is an endemic viral infection of the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat (Chaerephon plicatus aka Tadarida plicata plicata). Little is known about the ecology and maintenance of KKV within the bat population, nor the infection dynamics and transmission among bats or between bats and other vertebrates. Therefore, KKV was studied in Kaeng Khoi cave, Saraburi province, Thailand, during 1973-1974 with the objectives to (1) characterize the seasonal infection rates of KKV in the context of the bat population ecology, and (2) describe the infection dynamics and viral shedding by naturally- and experimentally-infected bats. To this end, the free-tailed bat population was estimated by a series of timed photographs taken during the evening exodus. The case population of 900,000 adult bats doubled at the time of weaning of the young and returned to its previous level soon thereafter. The newborn bats had neutralizing antibodies to KKV that were likely to be maternal in origin. The KKV antibody prevalence in adult bats was high (69-91%) in March-May and low (29-40%) in August and September. Kaeng Khoi virus was isolated from 75% of dead and 50% of moribund bats, but was not found in nearly 400 apparently healthy bats. Virus was present in saliva, urine and blood of most of the naturally-moribund bats tested. Consistent with observations from naturally-infected bats, experimental infection of bats with KKV revealed significant liver pathology, also suggestive that this is not a benign infection. Kaeng Khoi virus is an endemic, year-round infection maintained by the annual recruitment of a large number of immunologically-naive juvenile bats. Moreover, it produces an acute infection in the bat, either leading to death by hepatitis, or immunity.																					WOS:000735495000001	34698148

DETECTION OF AKABANE VIRUS GENOME IN ORGANS AND BLOOD OF EXPERIMENTALLY INFECTED CAVIES								Sel'skokhozyaistvennaya Biologiya					6			67	72						NOV-DEC 2014	2014	Akabane disease, a transmissible pathology of cattle, sheep and goats, is caused by Simbu serotype virus (Bunyaviridae) and results in significant economical losses due to abortions, unviable and abnormal calves, or dead embryos and calves born. The Akabane disease epizooties, characterized by geographic locations and the coincidence with definite seasons, are widely registered. For preparative accumulation of Akabane virus the 1-2 day mice are used as the most sensitive system for Bunyaviridae isolation. Earlier we reported the development of a test system for Akabane virus RNA indication by real time reverse transcription PCR. Its efficacy was approved using infected mice and cell cultures. Furthermore, it was of interest to estimate this test system with respect to more wide range of model animals to be involved in the study and reproduction of Akabane virus. In this investigation, healthy cavies (n = 20, the animal weight of 400 g) were infected with a concentrated viral culture (B8935 strain) of 7.0 lg lg TCID50/cm(3). In blood the Akabane virus RNA was detected in four animals only 4 days after inoculation, but not shown in the rest probes, which were sampled from 2 to 6 days, and one cavy died a day after infection, probably due to nonspecific reaction as the Akabane virus genome was not detected in the post mortem tissue samples of all the organs of the animal tested. After 4 days the Akabane virus RNA was also indicated in brain, lung, kidney, hart and lymphatic. gland. Thus, the developed test-system is effective for Akabane disease diagnosis, and the experimentally infected cavies can be the model animals used to study and produce Akabane virus preparations.

This study investigated the susceptibility and transmission potential by guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus) - phylogenetically close to an abundant Brazilian rodent (Cavia aperea) - to two VACV strains (P1V and P2V) isolated from an outbreak of cutaneous disease in horses in Southern Brazil. Eight guinea pigs inoculated intranasally with P1V and P2V (10(6) TCID(50-)ml(-1)) did not develop clinical signs, but six animals shed virus in nasal secretions (day 1 to 9 post-inoculation - pi), developed viremia (between days 1 and 10 pi) and seroconverted to VACV. In spite of virus replication and shedding, the virus was not transmitted to sentinel animals by direct or indirect contact (aerosols) or through food and water contaminated with virus. These results demonstrate that, in spite of replicating and shedding the virus, guinea pigs do not transmit the virus upon experimental inoculation. This finding makes unlikely a possible participation of related species in VACV maintenance and transmission in nature.																					WOS:000306227800017

Chandipura virus produces neurological symptoms in naturally infected young children and experimentally infected suckling mice. This study was undertaken to find out the neuro-invasive behaviour of Chandipura virus in suckling mice. The suckling mice were infected with the virus via footpad injection. Different tissues were collected at 24-h intervals up to 96-h post infection and processed for virus quantification and histological study. Further confirming the virus predilection to nerves tissues, the adult mice were inoculated with the virus via different routes. The suckling mice experimental results revealed a progressive replication of virus in spinal cord and brain. The progressive-virus replication was not observed in the other tissues like kidney, spleen, liver etc. Histo-pathological lesions noticed in the spinal cord and brain tissues suggested the extensive damages in these tissues. In adult mice experiment, the virus replication observed only in the brain of the mice infected via intra-cerebral route. From this study, we conclude that nervous tissues are predilection sites for Chandipura virus replication in suckling and adult mice. In suckling mice, virus might transmit through nervous tissues for dissemination. In contrast, the adult mice the nervous terminal might not pick up the virus through footpad infection. The pathogenesis in mice might be due to the virus replication mediated damage in the central nervous system.																					WOS:000324314000006	23826408

No overt signs of morbidity, mortality, or gross lesions were noted. Bats seroconverted by Day 10-16 post inoculation (p.i.), with the highest mean anti-EBOV IgG level on Day 28 p.i. EBOV RNA was detected in blood from one bat. In 16 other tissues tested, viral RNA distribution was limited and at very low levels. No seroconversion could be demonstrated in any of the control bats up to 28 days after in-contact exposure to subcutaneously-inoculated bats. The control bats were subsequently inoculated intraperitoneally, and intramuscularly with the same dose of EBOV. No mortality, morbidity or gross pathology was observed in these bats. Kinetics of immune response was similar to that in subcutaneously-inoculated bats. Viral RNA was more widely disseminated to multiple tissues and detectable in a higher proportion of individuals, but consistently at very low levels. Irrespective of the route of inoculation, no virus was isolated from tissues which tested positive for EBOV RNA. Viral RNA was not detected in oral, nasal, ocular, vaginal, penile and rectal swabs from any of the experimental groups.																					WOS:000371831800006	26805873

Virologica Sinica				18	2			104	107						April 2003	2003	To study the association of heat-shock protein GRP94 and HSP27 with Hantaan virus nucleocapsid protein (HTNV-NP), during viral replication, new-born mice less than 72h of age were experimentally infected with Hantaan virus intracerebrally. Brains of mice at the 8th day post-infection were prepared for tissue sections and extracts. Hantaan virus infection, GRP94, HSP27 expression and their localization were demonstrated by immunohistochemical-staining. The possible interaction between HTNV-NP and GRP94, HSP27 was analyzed by ELISA, immunoprecipitation. HTNV infection led to increased expression of GRP94 but not HSP27 at cytoplasma of neurons in brains of infected suckling mice, colocalization of GRP94 with HTNV-NP, and association of both GRP94 and HSP27 with HTNV-NP. The results provide the basis for further research of the roles of HSPs in the viral infection and replication.																					BCI:BCI200300266317

The aim of our study was to follow the persistence of viral RNA in selected organs of experimentally infected with coxsackievirus (CV) B5 strains from different sources such as a patient's sample, an environmental sample and a prototype virus strain. Methods. CD-I mice were infected with CVB5 strain Faulkner the prototype, CVB5 isolate from treated sewage waste and isolate from patient's stool sample both identified as CVB5. The viral RNA was detected by RT-PCR using enterovirus primers specific for the non-coding 5' region. Results. We observed presence of RNA in the brain and heart of mice infected with isolate from patient's stool at day 45 post infection (p. i.). Conclusion. We conclude that CVB5 persists in the brain and heart after oral infection of CD1 mice. The relevance of viral persistence maybe related viral origin and the genetics.

Seventy special pathogen free mice were divided into 2 groups with 35 mice in each group. The test group (TG) was infected with PCV-2b, the control group (CG) was inoculated with sterile cell cultures. Five mice in each group were sacrificed at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 dpi (day post infection), respectively. Necropsies were performed on all mice and tissues were collected for testing by histopathology, immunohistochemistry, transmission electron microscope (TEM) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Apoptosis and necrosis in lymphoid organs were observed in virus-infected mice, and became severe from 14 to 28 dpi. The proportion of PCV-2b antigen-positive cells was moderate in lung, heart, thymus, liver or kidney, and low in brain from TG. In spleen and cervical lymph node, the proportions of PCV-2b antigen-positive cells were low to high from 7 to 28 dpi, and moderate from 35 to 42 dpi. PCV-2b DNA was detected in all tissues examined in TG from 7 to 42 dpi. Viral inclusion bodies presented in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes, macrophages, hepatocytes, podocytes, neurocytes, spermatids and uterine epithelial cells in TG. In CG, no viruses and viral lesions were detected. PCV-2b could replicate in mice, and PCV-2b associated lesions in mice were similar to those observed in pigs. The present results indicate that it is possible to use Kunming mouse as an animal model for PMWS research.																					WOS:000287519400006	21287271

Here, we demonstrate the striking rapidity of such a response in C57BL/10 mice. The number of neurons containing viral DNA and viral antigens increased until 136 h after inoculation of virulent HSV type 1 (strain SC16) into flank skin. Subsequent disappearance of HSV DNA and antigens from infected ganglia was virtually complete only 8h later. A consistent and unexpected observation was detection of viral antigens in sensory nerve axons for at least 8h after their disappearance from neuronal somas, raising the intriguing possibility that virus or viral proteins may be transported distally after infection has been terminated.

Experimental data on the problem of the role of gamasid mites in the transmission of tick encephalitis virus and Omsk hemorrhagic fever [English summ.]				Eksperimental'nye dannye k voprosu o roli gamazovykh kleshchei v peredache virusa kleshchevogo entsefalita i omskoi gemorragicheskoi likhoradki [English summ.]				MED PARAZITOL IPARAZITAR BOLEZNI				30	(1)			24	26, 121-122						1961	1961	An epizootic of Omsk hemorrhagic fever among muskrats was observed in the Krutinka and Tyukalinsk raions (Omsk oblast'). It is probable that the muskrats were infected by water voles [Arvicola amphibius]. Experiments were conducted to determine the way in which the virus had been transmitted from the water vole to the muskrat and among muskrats. The water vole was inoculated with virus of tick encephalitis; on the 30th day the rats were killed and from them Laelaps muris, Hyperlaelaps amphibius, Hirstionyssus isabellinus, Haemolaelaps glasglowi, Laelaptidae (nymphs I and II) were removed. A suspension of the ground mites was injected into brains of white mice. On the 6th-8th day the mice died, showing lesions and paralysis. Study of the strain which was isolated showed its antigenetically close relationship (1:10, 1:80) to the virus of tick encephalitis and Omsk hemorrhagic fever. The muskrats were killed by the virus of the hemorrhagic fever. From those in which the virus was present in the blood for 23 days, L. multispinosus was removed and was placed on healthy animals (400-600 specimens). On the 3d day the virus was found in high titers (1:1000; 1:10,000) in the muskrats' blood. On the 6th-8th day the animals died. The virus of Omsk hemorrhagic fever was isolated from them. The authors assume that gamasid mites take part in the propagation of epizootics among muskrats and in the dissemination of the virus in the natural focus.

No deaths, overt signs of morbidity, or gross lesions was identified, but microscopic pathological changes were seen in the liver of infected bats. The virus was detected in 15 different tissues and plasma but only sporadically in mucosal swab samples, urine, and fecal samples. Neither seroconversion nor viremia could be demonstrated in any of the in-contact susceptible bats (n = 14) up to 42 days after exposure to infected bats. In bats rechallenged (n = 4) on day 48 after infection, there was no viremia, and the virus could not be isolated from any of the tissues tested. This study confirmed that infection profiles are consistent with MARV replication in a reservoir host but failed to demonstrate MARV transmission through direct physical contact or indirectly via air. Bats develop strong protective immunity after infection with MARV.																					WOS:000363189100006	25838270

The infection is not abundant either in naturally or experimentally infected gondis and white mice. Daily microscopical examination of the blood of sick animals revealed but few spirochaetes. White mice and Tunisian mice (Mus spretus) may be artificially infected, but rats, guinea pigs, Meriones shawi and monkeys are resistant. It is possible to propagate the virus by passage through mice if inoculation is made intraperitoneally with material from the brain taken in the 7th or 8th day of disease. Recovery from infection with S. gondii produces solid immunity but fails to protect against S. normandi or S. hispanicum. Infection with the last 2 organisms gives no protection against the 1st. S. gondii is probably carried from animal to animal by a tick (Onithodorus) found on the gondi. This is the 1st report of the transmission of the disease caused by S. gondii through Ornithodorus moubata, O. savignyi or O. marocanus infected in the nymphal state. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W. C.

Experimental infection of Artibeus intermedius bats with serotype-2 dengue virus								COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES				36	2			193	198		10.1016/j.cimid.2012.12.002				MAR 2013	2013	Dengue fever is caused by a flavivirus that primarily infects humans and Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, viral replication in wild animals other than non-human primates has been scarcely studied. In this report, the susceptibility of Artibeus intermedius frugivorous bat to serotype-2 dengue virus (DENV-2) infection was tested. Twenty-three bats were intraperitoneally inoculated with different viral loads of DENV-2 (New Guinea-C strain). Forty-three percent of the infected bats developed bruises on the chest or on the wings. Histological analyses showed structural alterations in the spleen and bleeding in liver and intestine, but the virus was not detected by RT-PCR in any of the analyzed tissues, and it was found in only one bat (kidney) by semi-nested RT-PCR. In sera, the viral RNA was detected by semi-nested RT-PCR in 39% of bats, but only 8% of bats seroconverted. Overall, these data indicate that DENV-2 replicates poorly in these bats, suggesting they are not suitable hosts to this virus. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Rabbits developed full protection against infection 3 weeks after the administration of a single dose. Antibodies were detectable from day 5 after vaccination. Naturally acquired antibodies were demonstrated in some rabbits kept on commercial farms. The virus survived at least 225 days in an organ suspension kept at 4-degrees-C, at least 105 days in the dried state on cloth at room temperature (around 20-degrees-C), and at least 2 days at 60-degrees-C, both in organ suspension and in the dry state. Experimental infection of rabbits younger than 2 months was successful in some animals. Hares, guinea pigs, white mice, golden and Chinese hamsters, chinchillas and hysterectomy-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets were resistant to infection.

The specific features of in vivo production of early cytokines after infection with A/Leningrad/134/57 (H2N2) wide-type virus and cold-adapted attenuated vaccine viruses								Voprosy Virusologii				51	2			27	30						MAR-APR 2006	2006	The production of proinflammatory cytokines was studied following experimental infection of BALB/c mice with influenza viruses that differed in virulence. The generation of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-gamma was investigated in the lung homogenates in the early periods after intranasal infection of mice with A/Leningrad/134/57 (H2N2) wild-type virus and cold-adapted attenuated vaccine viruses: A/Leningrad/134/17/57 (H2N2) and A/Leningrad/134/47/57 (H2N2). Wild-type virus induced substantially higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines: TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-gamma. After infection with the cold-adapted viruses, the levels of the cytokines were reduced as compared to those induced by the wild-type virus. The A/Leningrad/134/47/57 virus was marked by a noticeable production of IL-6 and IFN-gamma in the murine lung, but it was less than with wild-type virus infection. At the same time, the more attenuated strain A/Leningrad/134/47/57 induced TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in the quantities similar to those in the control animals. Thus, a response of proinflammatory cytokines in early infection in the murine lung depended on the level of viral replication in the lower respiratory tract and on the attenuation of influenza virus strains.

All the animals that we inoculated developed persistent infections, and SN virus could be isolated from tissues throughout the course of infection. The transition from an acute to a persistent pattern of infection appeared to occur between days 60 and 90 p.i. Beginning on day 60 p.i., the heart, brown adipose tissue (BAT), and lung retained antigen expression and genomic viral RNA the most frequently. We found a statistically significant association among the presence of replicative RNA in the heart, lung, and BAT, widespread antigen expression (in greater than or equal to5 tissues), and RNA viremia. Of these three tissues, the heart retained negative-strand RNA and viral N antigen the most consistently (in 25 of 26 animals). During persistence, there were two distinct patterns of infection: restricted versus disseminated tissue involvement. Mice with the restricted pattern exhibited N antigen expression in less than or equal to3 tissues, an absence of viral RNA in the blood, neutralizing antibody titers of less than or equal to1:1,280 (P = 0.01), and no replicative RNA in the heart, lung, or BAT. Those with the "disseminated" pattern showed N antigen expression in greater than or equal to5 tissues, neutralizing antibody titers of 1:160 to 1:20,480, replicative RNA in the heart, lung, and BAT at a high frequency, and RNA viremia. Virus could be isolated consistently only from mice that demonstrated the disseminated pattern. The heart, lung, and BAT are important sites for the replication and maintenance of SN virus during persistent infection.																					WOS:000180166600071	12502867

Lung tissues were processed following the standard techniques for photonic and electron transmission microscopies. Histopathological and ultrastructural studies showed interstitial pneumonia, characterized by the presence of mononuclear cells. In the mouse model, the dengue virus serotype 2 seems to led to a transient inflammatory process without extensive damage to the interalveolar septa, but caused focal alterations of the blood-exchange barrier. Endothelial cells of blood capillaries exhibited phyllopodia suggesting activation by presence of dengue virus. Morphometrical analysis of mast cells showed an expressive increase of the number of these cells in peribronchiolar spaces and adjacent areas to the interalveolar septa. Alveolar macrophages showed particles dengue virus-like inside rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex, suggesting viral replication. The tissue alterations observed in our experimental model were similar to the observed in human cases of dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever. Our results show that BALB/c mice are permissive host for dengue virus serotype 2 replication and therefore provides an useful model to study of. morphological aspects of dengue virus infection.

After intracerebral (ic) or intraperitoneal inoculation, XJCl3 was highly virulent for 2 day-old C3H/HeJ, OF1, and BALB/cJ mouse strains, whereas its derivative Cl67 was attenuated. Survival of the Cl67-infected mouse was associated with a restricted replication at the site of inoculation which would impair spread of virus. Thus, the reduced virulence of Cl67 for suckling mice is independent of the mouse strain and the route of viral entry. When Cl67 was preinoculated ic 10 days before the challenge inoculation with XJCl3 by the same route, mice were partially protected from lethal infection. Since neutralizing antibodies were first detected at 30 days post-infection, an interference mechanism is postulated as a mechanism of protection of the mice.

Since no protective vaccines or effective treatments are available for human use, accurate and reliable diagnostic methods are essential for surveillance of the disease in order to implement adequate public health actions. To study the kinetics of the RVF Virus (RVFV) infection, a SYBR Green-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was developed. By using primers targeting the S-segment of RVFV, the detection limit of this assay was estimated to 30 RNA templates. Blood and organs of experimentally infected mice were sampled at different time points and RVFV RNA was quantified. High amounts of RVFV RNA were found in blood, brain, and liver samples shortly after infection with a 1-4 days post infection window for viral RNA detection. Mice developed symptoms after the appearance of serum antibodies, indicating that the host response plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. The RVFV quantitative RT-PCR proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool during the first days of infection, before detectable antibody levels and visual symptoms of RVF were observed.

J	Taylor, Geraldine								Animal models of respiratory syncytial virus infection								VACCINE				35	3			469	480		10.1016/j.vaccine.2016.11.054				JAN 11 2017	2017	Human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) is a major cause of respiratory disease and hospitalisation of infants, worldwide, and is also responsible for significant morbidity in adults and excess deaths in the elderly. There is no licensed hRSV vaccine or effective therapeutic agent. However, there are a growing number of hRSV vaccine candidates that have been developed targeting different populations at risk of hRSV infection. Animal models of hRSV play an important role in the preclinical testing of hRSV vaccine candidates and although many have shown efficacy in preclinical studies, few have progressed to clinical trials or they have had only limited success. This is, at least in part, due to the lack of animal models that fully recapitulate the pathogenesis of hRSV infection in humans. This review summarises the strengths and limitations of animal models of hRSV, which include those in which hRSV is used to infect non-human mammalian hosts, and those in which non-human pneumoviruses, such as bovine (b)RSV and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are studied in their natural host.Apart from chimpanzees, other non-human primates (NHP) are only semi-permissive for hRSV replication and experimental infection with large doses of virus result in little or no clinical signs of disease, and generally only mild pulmonary pathology. Other animal models such as cotton rats, mice, ferrets, guinea pigs, hamsters, chinchillas, and neonatal lambs are also only semi-permissive for hRSV. Nevertheless, mice and cotton rats have been of value in the development of monoclonal antibody prophylaxis for infants at high risk of severe hRSV infection and have provided insights into mechanisms of immunity to and pathogenesis of hRSV. However, the extent to which they predict hRSV vaccine efficacy and safety is unclear and several hRSV vaccine candidates that are completely protective in rodent models are poorly effective in chimpanzees and other NHP, such as African Green monkeys. Furthermore, interpretation of findings from many rodent and NHP models of vaccine-enhanced hRSV disease has been confounded by sensitisation to non-viral antigens present in the vaccine and challenge virus.Studies of non-human pneumoviruses in their native hosts are more likely to reflect the pathogenesis of natural hRSV infection, and experimental infection of calves with bRSV and of mice with PVM result in clinical disease and extensive pulmonary pathology. These animal models have not only been of value in studies on mechanisms of immunity to and the pathogenesis of pneumovirus infections but have also been used to evaluate hRSV vaccine concepts. Furthermore, the similarities between the epidemiology of bRSV in calves and hRSV in infants and the high level of genetic and antigenic similarity between bRSV and hRSV, make the calf model of bRSV infection a relevant model for preclinical evaluation of hRSV vaccine candidates which contain proteins that are conserved between hRSV and bRSV.

Viremia in North American Mammals and Birds after Experimental Infection with Chikungunya Viruses								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				94	3			504	506		10.4269/ajtmh.15-0696				MAR 2016	2016	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus, which is known to cause severe disease only in humans. To investigate its potential zoonotic host range and evaluate reservoir competence among these hosts, experimental infections were performed on individuals from nine avian and 12 mammalian species representing both domestic and wild animals common to North America. Hamsters and inbred mice have previously been shown to develop viremia after inoculation with CHIKV and were used as positive controls for infection. Aside from big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus), none of the mammals or birds developed detectable viremia or overt clinical disease. However, most mammals and a smaller proportion of birds developed neutralizing antibody responses to CHIKV. On the basis of these results, it seems unlikely that CHIKV poses a significant health threat to most domestic animals or wildlife and that the species examined do not likely contribute to natural transmission cycles. Additional studies should further evaluate bats and wild rodents as potential reservoir hosts for CHIKV transmission during human epidemics.																					WOS:000371372600006	26666699

This study describes the isolation, molecular characterization and analysis of pathogenicity of MRV variant B/03 from wild short-nosed fruit bats. Negative stain electron microscopy illustrated that the B/03 strain is a non-enveloped icosahedral virus with a diameter of 70 nm. Sodiumdodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) migration patterns showed that the B/03 viral genome contains 10 segments in a 3:3:4 arrangement. The isolate belongs to MRV serotype 1 based on S1 gene nucleotide sequence data. BALB/c mice experimentally infected with B/03 virus by intranasal inoculation developed severe respiratory distress with tissue damage and inflammation. Lastly, B/03 virus has an increased transmission risk between bats and humans or animals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000379701100047	27259366

These include variants of a mouse orphan parvovirus (MOPV) and a hamster isolate designated hamster orphan parvovirus (HOPV). In this study, a PCR primer set specific for these newly identified rodent parvoviruses was designed on the basis of DNA sequence comparisons of these isolates with other autonomous parvoviruses. The specificity of the primer set was determined by testing viral preparations of seven different parvoviruses and eight other viruses known to infect rodents. The PCR essay amplified the expected 260-bp product only in the presence of DNA from MOPV, HOPV, or LuIII, a parvovirus of unknown species origin. The assay was able to detect as little as 10 pg of MOPV viral DNA or 1 pg of HOPV viral DNA, and it was able to detect MOPV in tissues from naturally infected mice and HOPV in tissues from experimentally infected hamsters. In contrast, the 260-bp product was not amplified from tissues of MOPV-negative mice or mock-infected hamsters. Our findings indicate that this PCR assay provides a rapid, specific, and sensitive method for the detection of MOPV in mice, HOPV in hamsters, and MOPV and HOPV in cell culture systems and that it may also be useful for the detection of LuIII contamination of cell culture systems.

Virological and pathomorphological aspects in experimental infections with some triassociated pneumotropic viruses in the white mouse								Romanian Journal of Virology				48	1-4			27	42						Jan.-Dec., 1997 (1998)	1997	Experimental infections were induced in white mice by intranasal administration of parainfluenza virus type 3, 739-2D strain, to which influenza virus A/Beijing, 353/89 (H3N2) strain, and respiratory syncytial virus, Long strain, were associated. The model was organized so as to obtain a triassociated infection, parainfluenza virus type 3 being inoculated the first and the other two viruses, in the following stages - II and III -, alternately. The infections were revealed by the presence of positive immunofluorescence reactions in the pulmonary tissue, of histological, histochemical and histoenzymatic lesions at the level of the respiratory apparatus, as well as of pathomorphological changes in other organs. At the pulmonary parenchyma level the inflammatory lesion had a 100% frequency. The severest pathomorphological picture was the diffuse, lymphohistiocytic and macrophagic bronchopneumonia. The cytoinfiltrate was characterized by a proportionality between lymphocytes and histiocytes and the lower but not insignificant presence of macrophages. The prevalent lesion was the thickening of interparietoalveolar septa, as a consequence of stasis hyperemia, oedema and lymphohistiomacrophagocytic infiltrate, to which dystrophic lesions, especially of biocytes, are often added. Different lesions are present in other organs, such as: in the liver - inflammatory, dystrophico-inflammatory and dystrophic lesions; in the kidney, pancreas, cerebellum and thymus - vascular changes, stasis hyperemia; in the spleen - hyperplasia of megakaryocytes. Generally, the type and severity of lesions vary from one viral-association-induced infection to another.																					BCI:BCI199900238995	9836325

Studies on the immune systems of natural hosts are helpful for preventing the spread of EIDs. Bats are natural hosts for many emerging infectious pathogens and have a unique immune system that often coexists with pathogens without infection. Previous studies have shown that some genes and proteins may help bats fight virus infection, but little is known about the function of the bat gut microbiome on immunity. Here, we transplanted gut microbiota from wild bats (Great Himalayan Leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros armiger) into antibiotic-treated mice, and found that the gut microbiota from bats regulated the immune system faster than mice after antibiotic treatment. Moreover, we infected mice with H1N1, and found that the gut microbiota of bats could effectively protect mice, leading to decreased inflammatory response and increased survival rate. Finally, metabolomics analysis showed that the gut microbiota of bats produced more flavonoid and isoflavones. Our results demonstrate that the quick-start innate immune response endowed by bat gut microbiota and the regulatory and antiviral effects of gut microbiota metabolites successfully ensured mouse survival after viral challenge. To our knowledge, our study was the first to use fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to transplant the gut microbiota of bats into mice, and the first to provide evidence that the gut microbiota of bats confers tolerance to viral infections.

In one case, the urine from 28 rats was collected on the 8th and 9th days of infection and 3 or 4 drops were permitted to contact the conjunctivae of guinea pigs for from 4 to 14 rnin. on 1-3 days; 1 animal of 22 tested was found to be immune to passage typhus. In the 2nd case, the urine of 18 rats was collected on the 8th and 9th days of infection and injected subconjunctivally into 8 guinea pigs and, again, one animal was found to be immune to passage typhus. No infection was demonstrated after intraperitoneal injection of urine from rats infected with any of the 3 strains of typhus, nor after subcut. injection of urine from rats infected with the Toulon strain. The authors conclude that the urine of experimentally infected rats is capable of infecting guinea pigs. They discuss the significance of this finding on the epidemiology of the disease. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: E. B. McKinley																					BCI:BCI19361000001302

Experimental rabies virus infection of big brown bats (Eeptesicus fuscus)								JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES				44	3			612	621		10.7589/0090-3558-44.3.612				JUL 2008	2008	A captive colony of adult Big Brown Bats (Eptesicus fuscus) was experimentally infected with a rabies virus (RABV) variant isolated from the salivary glands of a naturally infected Big Brown Bat and passaged once through murine neuroblastoma cell culture. Bats were divided into into 11 groups, which were composed of one to three noninfected and one to three infected individuals each. Twenty of 38 animals were infected intramuscularly into both left and right masseter muscles; they received a total of 10(3.2) median mouse intracerebral lethal dose (MICLD50) of Big Brown Bat RABV variant. Experimental outcome after viral exposure was if) the bats for 140 days postinoculation (PI). Of 20 infected bats, 16 developed clinical rabies, and the mean incubation period was 24 days (range: 13-52 days). Three infected bats never seroconverted and succumbed early to infection (13 days). Four infected bats that survived until the end of the experiment without any signs of disease maintained detectable antibody titers until the third month PI, peaking between days 13 and 43, and consequent drop-off below the threshold for detection occured by day, 140. Limited excretion of virus in saliva of infected bats during the clinical course of disease was observed ill two individuals on days 13 and 15 PI (<24 hr prior to onset of clinical illness). No bat-to-bat transmission of RABV to noninfected bats was detected.																					WOS:000258668600008	18689646

Transmission is by dog, cat, and monkey. Rabies has not been recognized in bats, although they are abundant. Neutralizing antibodies were not detected in sera from 490 f rugivorous (Pteropus vampyrus) and insectivorous (Phyllarina sp., Rhinolopus sp., and Vesperugo sp.) bats and 56 rats (Rattus rattus). Negri bodies were not detected in 440 bat and 56 rat brains, although non-specific, eosinophilic inclusions were seen in 22 bat and 5 rat brains. Intracerebral mouse inoculation of the latter specimens individually and of pooled specimens for a total of 452 bat and 56 rat brains and salivary glands was negative. Experimental inoculation of 67 frugivorous and 21 insectivorous bats with rabies virus by various routes produced infection in 36 and 23% respectively. Furious rabies developed in only 4 of the frugivorous bats. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: F. J. Roff																					BCI:BCI19644500096814

Despite significant effort, no evidence of infection of other mammals, mostly rodents, was found, suggesting that no other vertebrates harbored TCRV. For this reason, it was hypothesized that TCRV was naturally hosted by artibeus bats. This is in stark contrast to other arenaviruses with known hosts, all of which are rodents. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) to determine whether they could be persistently infected without substantial pathology. We subcutaneously or intranasally infected bats with TCRV strain TRVL-11573, the only remaining strain of TCRV, and found that low-dose (10(4) 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50]) inoculations resulted in asymptomatic and apathogenic infection and virus clearance, while high-dose (10(6) TCID50) inoculations caused substantial morbidity and mortality as early as 10 days postinfection. Uninoculated cage mates failed to seroconvert, and viral RNA was not detected in their tissues, suggesting that transmission did not occur. Together, these data suggest that A. jamaicensis bats may not be a reservoir host for TCRV.																					WOS:000303787100035	22379103

Detection of rabies virus in different tissues of experimentally infected mice at preclinical and postclinical stages of the disease								Indian Journal of Experimental Biology				30	10			877	880						1992	1992	Rabies fixed virus (CVS) was passaged 10 times in mice by intramuscular (im) route followed by experimental inoculation of the titrated virus in 4 groups of mice with the dose of 0.1 ml of 1000 mouse (LD-50 0.03 ml) using intracerebral (ic), intravenous (iv) intramuscular (im), intraocular (io), and intranasal (in) routes respectively. No marked variation in clinical signs due to variation of routes could be detected. Involvement of brain with io route could be detected even in preclinical stage. Although the virus could be detected in the postclinical stage in all the tissues under study (brain, skin, salivary gland and corneal impression), with io and ic routes spread of the virus was observed in comparatively higher concentrations.

It has been noted that Coxsackie B viruses are etiologically related to myocarditis, myositis and other diseases. In current study, a recombinant plasmid pCBIII/51, derived from 5, end sequence of Coxsackie B virus type 3 genome, were chosen as a probe to detect Coxsackie B virus RNA from experimentally infected mice. 32p-labeled probe was used in slot-blot hybridization to detect virus RNA quantitatively from the tissue samples, while biotin-labeled probe was employed in in situ hybridization to localise virus genome at the cellular level. Experimental myocarditis and myositis had been induced in mice and suckling mice by inoculation with Coxsackie B3 and B1 virus respectively. Frozen samples were prepared for the membrane hybridization and formalin fixed-parrafin embedded ones for in situ hybridization. By either technique Coxsackie B virus RNA could be steadily detected from myocarditis and myositis samples of experimental mice. It has been observed that chronic myositis persisted over six months. In slot blot hybridization, the hybridization index of two myocarditis and six myositis samples were higher than normal control (> 3 .times. SD). The result obtained by this technique is objective and quantitative. Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded thin sections were hybridized with biotin-labelled probe after pretreatment with proteinase K. The hybridization signals were visualized by HRP-OPD reaction and localized in muscular fibers of myocarditis and myositis. The signals were not observed within infiltrative lymphoyctes. The result obtained by in situ hybridization is in agreement with slot blot hybridization. Moreover, it avoids the weak points of radioactive probe and can localize virus genome at cellular level, which will facilitate research on pathogenesis.																					BCI:BCI199089060262

Twelve mice were infected, and samples were obtained at day 2, 5, and 9 postinfection (pi). Most of the infected mice exhibited clinical signs of illness such as reduced movement, crouching, loose feces, loss of appetite, and reduced water intake. Blood samples from six mice were positive for BVDV based on reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Blood analysis also revealed thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Viral antigens were detected in the spleen (12/12), bone marrow (12/12), and/or mesenteric lymph nodes (4/12) of all infected mice by IHC analysis. The spleens showed significant histopathological changes including (i) substantially increased numbers of megakaryocytes, (ii) lymphocyte depletion, and (iii) hemorrhages. The bone marrow also had an increased number of megakaryocytes, although this increase was not as strong as it was in the spleen. Severe lymphoid depletion was observed in the mesenteric lymph nodes. Viral infections were present in the lymphocytes but not detected in megakaryocytes of the spleen, bone marrow, or mesenteric lymph nodes. These results suggest that the increased numbers of megakaryocytes may be a direct result of BVDV infection. BVDV infection in mice following oral inoculation of cp BVDV1 leads to megakaryopoiesis in the spleen and bone marrow to replenish the platelets.																					WOS:000368710100017	26526150

Pathogenesis of aerosolized Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus infection in guinea pigs								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				6						170	10.1186/1743-422X-6-170				OCT 23 2009	2009	Mice and guinea pigs were experimentally exposed to aerosols containing regionally-distinct strains (NJ1959 or ArgM) of eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) at two exclusive particle size distributions. Mice were more susceptible to either strain of aerosolized EEEV than were guinea pigs; however, clinical signs indicating encephalitis were more readily observed in the guinea pigs. Lower lethality was observed in both species when EEEV was presented at the larger aerosol distribution (> 6 mu m), although the differences in the median lethal dose (LD50) were not significant. Virus isolation and immunohistochemistry indicated that virus invaded the brains of guinea pigs within one day postexposure, regardless of viral strain or particle size distribution. Immunohistochemistry further demonstrated that neuroinvasion occurred through the olfactory system, followed by transneuronal spread to all regions of the brain. Olfactory bipolar neurons and neurons throughout the brain were the key viral targets. The main microscopic lesions in infected guinea pigs were neuronal necrosis, inflammation of the meninges and neuropil of the brain, and vasculitis in the brain. These results indicate that guinea pigs experimentally infected by aerosolized EEEV recapitulate several key features of fatal human infection and thus should serve as a suitable animal model for aerosol exposure to EEEV.

J	LOU, T. Y.; WENNER, H. A.								Infection of dogs with type 1 reovirus								AMER J HYG				77	(3)			292	304						1963	1963	A strain of reovirus type 1 has been isolated from a dog which died 2 weeks after onset of a respiratory infection. In monkey kidney cells this virus produced intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies similar to those observed following infection with Lang (reovirus, type 1) strain. Experimentally infected weanling dogs developed signs of illness related to the respiratory system. Both naturally and experimentally infected dogs developed interstitial pneumonitis; intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were found in the bronchial epithelium. Measurable amounts of neutralizing antibodies were present in about one third of normal adult dogs. The dog-lung strain of virus, although producing few, if any clinical signs of infection in monkeys, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters or ferrets, probably propagated in tissues of most species since the virus was recovered from various tissues, and homotypic antibodies often developed in these animals. The virus may produce illness in mice; no attempt was made to adapt the virus in mice. It is concluded that reovirus type 1 is very likely another viral pathogen of canine species. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19644500096851

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) contains the furin cleavage Proline-ArginineArginine-Alanine (PRRA) motif in the S1/S2 region, which enhances viral pathogenicity but is absent in closely related bat and pangolin coronaviruses. Whether bat-like coronaviral variants without PRRA (APRRA) can establish natural infections in humans is unknown.Methods. Here, we developed a duplex digital polymerase chain reaction assay to examine APRRA variants in Vero-E6-propagated isolates, human organoids, experimentally infected hamsters, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients.Results. We found that SARS-CoV-2, as currently transmitting in humans, contained a quasispecies of wild-type, Delta PRRA variants and variants that have mutations upstream of the Delta PRRA motif. Moreover, the Delta PRRA variants were readily detected despite being at a low intra-host frequency in transmitted founder viruses in hamsters and in COVID-19 patients, including in acute cases and a family cluster, with a prevalence rate of 52.9%.Conclusions. Our findings demonstrate that bat-like SARS-CoV-2(Delta PRRA) not only naturally exists but remains transmissible in COVID-19 patients, which has significant implications regarding the zoonotic origin and natural evolution of SARS-CoV-2.

Experimental Infection of Mice with Hamster Parvovirus: Evidence for Interspecies Transmission of Mouse Parvovirus 3								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				60	2			123	129						APR 2010	2010	Hamster parvovirus (HaPV) was isolated 2 decades ago from hamsters with clinical signs similar to those induced in hamsters experimentally infected with other rodent parvoviruses. Genetically, HaPV is most closely related to mouse parvovirus (MPV), which induces subclinical infection in mice. A novel MPV strain, MPV3, was detected recently in naturally infected mice, and genomic sequence analysis indicates that MPV3 is almost identical to HaPV. The goal of the present studies was to examine the infectivity of HaPV in mice. Neonatal and weanling mice of several mouse strains were inoculated with HaPV. Tissues, excretions, and sera were harvested at 1, 2, 4, and 8 wk after inoculation and evaluated by quantitative PCR and serologic assays specific for HaPV. Quantitative PCR detected viral DNA quantities that greatly exceeded the quantity of virus in inocula in multiple tissues of infected mice. Seroconversion to both nonstructural and structural viral proteins was detected in most immunocompetent mice 2 or more weeks after inoculation with HaPV. In neonatal SCID mice, viral transcripts were detected in lymphoid tissues by RT-PCR and viral DNA was detected in feces by quantitative PCR at 8 wk after inoculation. No clinical signs, gross, or histologic lesions were observed. These findings are similar to those observed in mice infected with MPV. These data support the hypothesis that HaPV and MPV3 are likely variants of the same viral species, for which the mouse is the natural rodent host with rare interspecies transmission to the hamster.

Methods: The mouse inoculation test (MIT), fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used. The rabies virus was administered to ticks via the intra-coelomic route, and the ticks were sacrificed at different time points. Results: The inoculated ticks were negative for rabies according to the MIT. Ticks macerated with rabies virus were positive according to the MIT and FAT. All of the tick lots tested by PCR were positive. Conclusions: The rabies virus became unviable shortly after its inoculation into tick bodies. Ticks are not likely to play an important role in the epidemiology of rabies.																					WOS:000330539200023	24474026

With the purpose of more accurately modelling human disease progression we infected several small-mammalian models: guinea pigs, hamsters and ferrets with a titered infectious dose of Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV). Clinical indicators of disease severity were observed for seventeen days, on day eighteen a visual post-mortem analysis of visceral organs was conducted. Viral load in selected tissues was measured to infer disease signs and the establishment of viral replication.Data descriptionDaily monitoring did not reveal any observable signs of illness; weight loss was minimal across species and gross pathology did not indicate severe viral infection. Tissue specific tropism and establishment of viral infection was monitored by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). No viral replication was detected in ferrets (n=0/3), but was present in the spleen of guinea pigs (n=3/3) and the brain of hamsters (n=3/3). Low levels of viral RNA were detected in multiple hamster tissues (kidney, liver, lung and spleen) suggesting the possibility of viral tropism and possible adaptation to the host. No serological tests were performed.																					WOS:000541678700004	32539799

Herein, we assessed the evolution of neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) genes of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) viruses recovered from the lungs of experimentally infected BALB/c mice receiving suboptimal doses (0.05 and 1 mg/kg of body weight/day) of oseltamivir over two generations. The traditional phenotypic and genotypic methods as well as deep-sequencing analysis were used to characterize the potential selection of mutations and population dynamics of oseltamivir-resistant variants. No oseltamivir-resistant NA or HA changes were detected in the recovered A/WSN/33 viruses. However, we observed a positive selection of the I222T NA substitution in the recovered A/Victoria/3/75 viruses, with a frequency increasing over time and with an oseltamivir concentration from 4% in the initial pretherapy inoculum up to 28% after two lung passages. Although the presence of mixed I222T viral populations in mouse lungs only led to a minimal increase in oseltamivir 50% enzyme-inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) (by a mean of 5.7-fold) compared to that of the baseline virus, the expressed recombinant A/Victoria/3/75 I222T NA protein displayed a 16-fold increase in the oseltamivir IC50 level compared to that of the recombinant wild type (WT). In conclusion, the combination of serial in vivo passages under neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) pressure and temporal deep-sequencing analysis enabled, for the first time, the identification and selection of the oseltamivir-resistant I222T NA mutation in an influenza H3N2 virus. Additional in vivo selection experiments with other antivirals and drug combinations might provide important information on the evolution of antiviral resistance in influenza viruses.

Experimental infection of laboratory animals with the "Shizuoka" strain isolated from bovine encephalomyelitis								JAPANESE JOUR EXPTL MED				24	(5)			313	324						1954	1954	The pathogenicity of the Shizuoka strain which is the causative agent of bovine encephalomyelitis and a member of the psittacosis-lymphogranuloma group of viruses was studied in guinea pigs, mice, developing eggs, pigs and a goat. The Shizuoka strain has relatively high pathogenicity to guinea pigs and readily infects guinea pigs when inoculated intranasally, intraperitoneally, intracerebrally or subcutaneously. Intraperitoneal inoculation produces pulmonary consolidation, peritonitis and swelling of spleen and intranasal instillation regularly produces lung co'nsolidation. Mice are less susceptible to the virus. Lung consolidation is observed by intranasal instillation but no death ensues after intravenous inoculation. In developing chicken eggs the virus proliferates well in various tissues when inoculated into yolk sac, the highest virus titer being obtained in yolk sac and yolk. Pulmonary consolidation develops in swine when inoculated intratracheally, but no gross pathological lesions by intracerebral inoculation. A goat inoculated intratracheally experineces slight illness with fever and pulmonary consolidation. On the basis of pathogenicity the Shizuoka strain is most closely related to the bovine strains of York et al and Wenner et al. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. concl																					BCI:BCI19573100025395	13242261

Isolation and Characterization of a Distinct Influenza A Virus from Egyptian Bats								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	2					e01059-18	10.1128/JVI.01059-18				JAN 2019	2019	Recently, two genetically distinct influenza viruses were detected in bats in Guatemala and Peru. We conducted influenza A virus surveillance among four bat species in Egypt. Out of 1,202 swab specimens, 105 were positive by real-time PCR. A virus was successfully isolated in eggs and propagated in MDCK cells in the presence of N-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. Genomic analysis revealed that the virus was phylogenetically distinct from all other influenza A viruses. Analysis of the hemagglutinin gene suggested a common ancestry with other H9 viruses, and the virus showed a low level of cross-reactivity with serum raised against H9N2 viruses. Bats were seropositive for the isolated viruses. The virus replicated in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. While it is genetically distinct, this virus shares several avian influenza virus characteristics suggesting a more recent avian host origin.IMPORTANCE Through surveillance, we isolated and characterized an influenza A virus from Egyptian fruit bats. This virus had an affinity to avian-like receptors but was also able to infect mice. Our findings indicate that bats may harbor a diversity of influenza A viruses. Such viruses may have the potential to cross the species barrier to infect other species, including domestic birds, mammals, and, possibly, humans.																					WOS:000454921600007	30381492

The results showed a statistically significant decrease at the 6th and 12th h after infection. No variations were observed at the 24th and 48th h. There was a statistically significant decrease during severe cytolysis at the 72nd h. The serine dehydratase behavior activity may be the result of the different concentration of glucagon and glucocorticoids, hormones involved in the induction of the enzyme. Since serine dehydratase is fundamental in hepatic gluconeogenesis, the results indicate a decreased capacity for gluconeogenesis due to a consequential decreased utilization of serine and may explain the hypoglycemia condition during the final phases of the experimental viral disease.

PUUV is a causative agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), while TULV is thought to be apathogenic to humans. The N-terminal regions of the N proteins from TULV and PUUV were expressed and applied as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) antigens. Colonized Japanese grass voles (Microtus montebelli) and BALB/c mice were used for experimental inoculation of the vole-borne hantaviruses TULV and PUUV. Voles and mice showed significant antibody production toward both viruses, but these antisera showed little cross-reactivity between TULV and PUUV in the immunofluorescence antibody assay and ELISA. In contrast, sera from patients with HFRS caused by PUUV exhibited high cross-reactivity against the TULV antigen, and sera from a natural rodent reservoir showed moderate cross-reactivity against the heterologous antigen, indicating that the antigenic cross-reactivity between TULV and PUUV differs in sera from rodents and humans.

Pathogenesis, Humoral Immune Responses, and Transmission between Cohoused Animals in a Ferret Model of Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				92	4					e01322-17	10.1128/JVI.01322-17				FEB 2018	2018	Small-animal models have been used to obtain many insights regarding the pathogenesis and immune responses induced following infection with human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV). Among those described to date, infections in cotton rats, mice, guinea pigs, chinchillas, and Syrian hamsters with hRSV strains Long and/or A2 have been well characterized, although clinical isolates have also been examined. Ferrets are also susceptible to hRSV infection, but the pathogenesis and immune responses elicited following infection have not been well characterized. Here, we describe the infection of adult ferrets with hRSV Long or A2 via the intranasal route and characterized virus replication, as well as cytokine induction, in the upper and lower airways. Virus replication and cytokine induction during the acute phase of infection (days 0 to 15 postinfection) were similar between the two strains, and both elicited high levels of F glycoprotein-specific binding and neutralizing antibodies following virus clearance (days 16 to 22 postinfection). Importantly, we demonstrate transmission from experimentally infected donor ferrets to co-housed naive recipients and have characterized virus replication and cytokine induction in the upper airways of infected contact animals. Together, these studies provide a direct comparison of the pathogenesis of hRSV Long and A2 in ferrets and highlight the potential of this animal model to study serological responses and examine interventions that limit transmission of hRSV.IMPORTANCE Ferrets have been widely used to study pathogenesis, immunity, and transmission following human influenza virus infections; however, far less is known regarding the utility of the ferret model to study hRSV infections. Following intranasal infection of adult ferrets with the well-characterized Long or A2 strain of hRSV, we report virus replication and cytokine induction in the upper and lower airways, as well as the development of virus-specific humoral responses. Importantly, we demonstrate transmission of hRSV from experimentally infected donor ferrets to co-housed naive recipients. Together, these findings significantly enhance our understanding of the utility of the ferret as a small-animal model to investigate aspects of hRSV pathogenesis and immunity.

Interdisciplinary perspectives on infectious diseases				2019				4124865	4124865		10.1155/2019/4124865				2019	2019	The emergence of novel highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) in migratory birds raises serious concerns as these viruses have the potential to spread during fall migration. We report the identification of novel HPAIV A(H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4 virus that was isolated from sick domestic duck at commercial farm during the second wave of spread that began in October and affected poultry (ducks; chiсkens) in several European regions of Russia and Western Siberia in 2016. The strain was highly lethal in experimental infection of chickens and mice with IVPI = 2.34 and MLD50 = 1.3log10⁡ EID50, accordingly. Inoculation of chickens with the HPAIV A/H5N8 demonstrated neuroinvasiveness, multiorgan failure, and death of chickens on the 3rd day post inoculation. Virus replicated in all collected organ samples in high viral titers with the highest titer in the brain (6.75±0.1 log10TCID50/ml). Effective virus replication was found in the following cells: neurons and glial cells of a brain; alveolar cells and macrophages of lungs; epithelial cells of a small intestine; hepatocytes and Kupffer cells of a liver; macrophages and endothelial cells of a spleen; and the tubular epithelial cells of kidneys. These findings advance our understanding of histopathological effect of A(H5N8) HPAIV infection.																					MEDLINE:31354812	31354812

An approach based on viral metagenomics was used to study gut specimens from 78 insectivorous bats in Yunnan Province, China. Seventy-four reads were found to be related to group A rotavirus (RVA). Further reverse transcription-PCR screening and viral isolation on cell cultures confirmed the presence of a novel RVA strain, named RVA/Bat-tc/MSLH14/2012/G3P[3], in 1 (6%) of 16 lesser horseshoe bats. Full genomic sequencing analyses showed that MSLH14 possessed the genotype constellation G3-P[3]-I8-R3-C3-M3-A9-N3-T3-E3-H6, which is akin to human and animal rotaviruses believed to be of feline/canine origin. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that VP7 was most closely related to bovine RVA strains from India, whereas VP4 was most closely related to an unusual human RVA strain, CMH222, with animal characteristics isolated in Thailand. The remaining gene segments were only distantly related to a range of animal RVA strains, most of which are believed to be related to feline/canine RVAs. Experimental infection showed that bat RVA strain MSLH14 was highly pathogenic to suckling mice, causing 100% mortality when they were inoculated orally with a titer as low as 5 x 10(2) 50% tissue culture infective doses. As this virus is not closely related to any known RVA strain, it is tempting to speculate that it is a true bat RVA strain rather than a virus transmitted between species. However, further screening of bat populations, preferably juvenile animals, will be crucial in determining whether or not this virus is widely distributed in the bat population.

This study was to determine the suitability of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) as animal model for HAV infection. Animals were inoculated, either intragastrically or intravenously, with a Brazilian HAV isolate (HAF-203). Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and anti-HAV antibodies (IgM and total) were monitored. Feces were daily collected for HAV antigen and HAV RNA detection. Samples of liver tissue were obtained by biopsy before inoculation, at peak ALT levels and/or when anti-HAV antibodies developed, and at necropsy for morphological examination. Monkeys inoculated by the intravenous route rapidly developed significant elevations of serum ALT, anti-HAV antibodies, and liver histologic changes, while the only evidence of HAV infection in intragastrically inoculated animals was the seroconversion. Moreover, squirrel monkeys excreted very low levels of HAV detectable in only few fecal samples after amplification by RT-PCR, different from humans and other non-human primate species that eliminate large quantities of virus during the late incubation period. The unusual onset of hepatitis A in experimentally infected squirrel monkeys represent an important obstacle for its use as animal model for the study of this viral infection. However, they can represent a valuable tool for the obtention of hyperimmune sera for HAV, in the view of the very high titer of anti-HAV developed (10(5)) 24 days after a single intravenous inoculation.

J	Shi, Hong-Fei; Zhu, Yuan-Mao; Dong, Xiu-Mei; Cai, Hong; Ma, Lei; Wang, Shu; Yan, Hao; Wang, Xue-Zhi; Xue, Fei								Pathogenesis of a genotype C strain of bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 infection in albino guinea pigs								VIRUS RESEARCH				188				1	7		10.1016/j.virusres.2014.03.017				AUG 8 2014	2014	Bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3) is one of the most important of the known viral respiratory tract agents of both young and adult cattle and widespread among cattle around the world. Up to present, three genotypes A, B and C of BPIV3 have been described on the basis of genetic and phylogenetic analysis and only limited studies on the pathogenesis of the genotype A of BPIV3 infection in calves and laboratory animals have been performed. The report about experimental infections of the genotypes B and C of BPIV3 in laboratory animals and calves was scant. Therefore, an experimental infection of guinea pigs with the Chinese BPIV3 strain SD0835 of the genotype C was performed. Sixteen guinea pigs were intranasally inoculated with the suspension of 5D0835, while eight control guinea pigs were also intranasally inoculated with the same volume of supernatant from uninfected MDBK cells. The virus-inoculated guinea pigs displayed a few observable clinical signs that were related to the respiratory tract disease and two of the sixteen experimentally infected guinea pigs died at 2 and 3 days post inoculation (PI), respectively, and apparent gross pneumonic lesions Were observed at necropsy. The gross pneumonic lesions in guinea pigs inoculated with 5D0835 consisted of dark red, slightly depressed, irregular areas of consolidation in the lung lobes from the second to 9th day of infection at necropsy, and almost complete consolidation and atelectasis of the lung lobes were seen at 7 days PI. Histopathological changes including alveoli septa thickening and focal cellulose pneumonia were also observed in the lungs of guinea pigs experimentally infected with SD0835. Viral replication was detectable by virus isolation and titration, real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in the respiratory tissues of guinea pigs as early as 24 h after intranasal inoculation with SD0835. The results of virus isolation and titration showed that guinea pigs were permissive for SD0835 replication and exhibited a higher virus replication level in both lungs and tracheas. As well, the results of IHC staining implicated that the lungs and tracheas were the major tissues in which SD0835 replicated. Virus-specific serum neutralizing antibodies against BPIV3 were detected in virus-inoculated guinea pigs. The aforementioned results indicated that BPIV3 strain SD0835 of the genotype C was pathogenic to guinea pigs and could cause a few observable clinical signs, and gross and histologic lesions in virus-inoculated guinea pigs. Thus guinea pig is an ideal laboratory animal infection model for BPIV3 and would cast more light on the genotype C of BPIV3 infection process, in vivo tropism and pathogenesis or serve as a useful system for monitoring the pathogenesis of SD0835 and other BPIV3 isolates.

We experimentally infected nine eastern gray squirrels with WNV to determine the clinical effects of infection and to assess their potential role as amplifying hosts. We observed no morbidity or mortality attributable to WNV infection, but lesions were apparent in several organs. We detected mean viremias of 10(5.1) and 10(4.8) plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL on days 3 and 4 postinfection (DPI) and estimated that -2.1% of Culex pipiens feeding on squirrels during 1-5 DPI would become infectious. Thus, S. carolinensis are unlikely to be important amplifying hosts and may instead dampen the intensity of transmission in most host communities. The low viremias and lack of mortality observed in S. carolinensis suggest that they may be useful as sentinels of spillover from the enzootic amplification cycle.

Veterinary world				14	10			2817	2826		10.14202/vetworld.2021.2817-2826				2021-Oct	2021	The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is one of its kind in the history of public health that has created a major global threat. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a zoonotic source and hence, reverse zoonosis (disease transmission from humans to animals) increases the risk and rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological and molecular analyses and experimental infection studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 infection in several animal species in various countries. Different domestic and wild animals, including cats, dogs, tigers, lions, puma, snow leopard, minks, and pet ferrets, are infected naturally with SARS-CoV-2, mostly through suspected human to animal transmission. In addition, in vivo experimental inoculation studies have reported the susceptibility of cats, ferrets, hamsters, Egyptian fruit bats, and non-human primates to the virus. These experimentally infected species are found to be capable of virus transmission to co-housed animals of the same species. However, SARS-CoV-2 showed poor replication in livestock species such as pigs, chickens, and ducks with no detection of viral RNA after the animals were deliberately inoculated with the virus or exposed to the infected animals. As the pets/companion animals are more susceptible to COVID-19, the infection in animals needs an in-depth and careful study to avoid any future transmissions. The one health approach is the best inter-disciplinary method to understand the consequences of viral spread and prevention in novel host populations for the betterment of public health. Further in this review, we will explain in detail the different natural and experimentally induced cases of human to animal SARS-CoV-2 infection.																					MEDLINE:34903944	34903944

Here, we investigated the capacity of a widely used rabies inactivated vaccine (Rabisin, Boehringer-Ingelheim) for veterinary use to cross-protect mice experimentally infected with European bat lyssavirus 1 (EBLV-1b), European bat lyssavirus 2 (EBLV-2), and Bokeloh bat lyssavirus (BBLV) occurring in Europe. For each lyssavirus, we investigated the efficacy of two different doses of vaccine against two viral doses administrated by either central or peripheral routes. In parallel, seroconversion following pre-exposure vaccination was investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that the three investigated bat isolates were pathogenic, even at low dose, when inoculated by the central route but were not/less pathogenic when administrated peripherally. The Rabisin vaccine was capable of significantly cross-protecting mice inoculated intramuscularly with EBLV-1b and EBLV-2 and intracerebrally with BBLV. The level of rabies neutralizing antibodies induced by the Rabisin was quite high against the bat lyssaviruses, but with no significant differences between immunization with 1 and 5 IU/dose. The study emphasizes that the quality of rabies-inactivated vaccines for veterinary use is of utmost importance to optimize the cross-protection of pets against phylogroup I bat lyssaviruses occurring in Europe.

Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats.IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.

MERS-CoV causes disease in humans with thirty-five percent fatality, and has evolved proteins that counteract human antiviral responses. Since bats experimentally infected with MERS-CoV do not develop signs of disease, we tested the hypothesis that MERS-CoV would replicate less efficiently in bat cells than in human cells because of its inability to subvert antiviral responses in bat cells. We infected human and bat (Eptesicus fuscus) cells with MERS-CoV and observed that the virus grew to higher titers in human cells. MERS-CoV also effectively suppressed the antiviral interferon beta (IFN) response in human cells, unlike in bat cells. To determine if IRF3, a critical mediator of the interferon response, also regulated the response in bats, we examined the response of IRF3 to poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of viral double-stranded RNA. We observed that bat IRF3 responded to poly(I:C) by nuclear translocation and post-translational modifications, hallmarks of IRF3 activation. Suppression of IRF3 by small-interfering RNA (siRNA) demonstrated that IRF3 was critical for poly(I:C) and MERS-CoV induced induction of IFN in bat cells. Our study demonstrates that innate antiviral signaling in E. fuscus bat cells is resistant to MERS-CoV-mediated subversion.																					WOS:000460803200062	30781790

This variant demonstrated cross resistance to zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir and laninamivir. In this study, the viral fitness of the recombinant wild-type (WT), E119D and E119D/H275Y A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses was evaluated in vitro and in experimentally-infected C57BL/16 mice and guinea pigs. In replication kinetics experiments, viral titers obtained with the E119D and E119D/H275Y recombinants were up to 2- and 4-log lower compared to the WT virus in MDCK and ST6GaII-MDCK cells, respectively. Enzymatic studies revealed that the E119D mutation significantly decreased the surface NA activity. In experimentally infected mice, a 50% mortality rate was recorded in the group infected with the WT recombinant virus whereas no mortality was observed in the E119D and E119D/H275Y groups. Mean lung viral titers on day 5 post-inoculation for the WT (1.2 +/- 0.57 x 10(8) PFU/ml) were significantly higher than those of the E119D (9.75 +/- 0.41 x 10(5) PFU/ml, P < 0.01) and the E119D/H275Y (1.47 +/- 0.61 x 10(6) PFU/ml, P < 0.01) groups. In guinea pigs, comparable seroconversion rates and viral titers in nasal washes (NW) were obtained for the WT and mutant index and contact groups. However, the D119E reversion was observed in most NW samples of the E119D and E119D/H275Y animals. In conclusion, the E119D NA mutation that could emerge in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during zanamivir therapy has a significant impact on viral fitness and such mutant is unlikely to be highly transmissible.

Stable disappearance of viral expression occurs at 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation. This coincides with the development of the anti-HTLV-l immune response and persistent detection of the provirus in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this study, the HTLV-1 replication pattern was analyzed over time in PBMCs and various organs from two HTLV-1-infected squirrel monkeys. Real-time quantitative PCR confirmed that PBMCs and lymphoid organs constitute the major reservoirs for HTLV-1. The PCR amplification of HTLV-1 Banking sequences from PBMCs evidenced a pattern of clonal expansion of infected cells identical to that observed in humans. Dissemination of the virus in body compartments appeared to result from cellular transport of the integrated provirus. The circulating proviral burden increased as a function of time in one animal studied over a period of 4 years. The high proviral loads observed in the last samples resulted from the accumulation of infected cells via the extensive proliferation of a restricted number of persistent clones on a background of polyclonally expanded HTLV-l-positive cells. Therefore, HTLV-1 primary infection in squirrel monkeys is a two-step process involving a transient phase of reverse transcription followed by persistent multiplication of infected cells. This suggests that the choice of the target for blocking HTLV-1 replication might depend on the stage of infection.																					WOS:000166015000058	11134325

J	Gerrard, Diana L; Hawkinson, Ann; Sherman, Tyler; Modahl, Cassandra M; Hume, Gretchen; Campbell, Corey L; Schountz, Tony; Frietze, Seth								Transcriptomic Signatures of Tacaribe Virus-Infected Jamaican Fruit Bats.								mSphere				2	5						10.1128/mSphere.00245-17				2017 Sep-Oct	2017	Tacaribe virus (TCRV) is a mammalian arenavirus that was first isolated from artibeus bats in the 1950s. Subsequent experimental infection of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) caused a disease similar to that of naturally infected bats. Although substantial attention has focused on bats as reservoir hosts of viruses that cause human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and their pathogens. We performed a transcriptome-wide study to illuminate the response of Jamaican fruit bats experimentally infected with TCRV. Differential gene expression analysis of multiple tissues revealed global and organ-specific responses associated with innate antiviral responses, including interferon alpha/beta and Toll-like receptor signaling, activation of complement cascades, and cytokine signaling, among others. Genes encoding proteins involved in adaptive immune responses, such as gamma interferon signaling and costimulation of T cells by the CD28 family, were also altered in response to TCRV infection. Immunoglobulin gene expression was also elevated in the spleens of infected bats, including IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. These results indicate an active innate and adaptive immune response to TCRV infection occurred but did not prevent fatal disease. This de novo assembly provides a high-throughput data set of the Jamaican fruit bat and its host response to TCRV infection, which remains a valuable tool to understand the molecular signatures involved in antiviral responses in bats. IMPORTANCE As reservoir hosts of viruses associated with human disease, little is known about the interactions between bats and viruses. Using Jamaican fruit bats infected with Tacaribe virus (TCRV) as a model, we characterized the gene expression responses to infection in different tissues and identified pathways involved with the response to infection. This report is the most detailed gene discovery work in the species to date and the first to describe immune gene expression responses in bats during a pathogenic viral infection.

Characterization of Teviot virus, an Australian bat-borne paramyxovirus								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				100	3			403	413		10.1099/jgv.0.001214				MAR 2019	2019	Bats are the reservoir hosts for multiple viruses with zoonotic potential, including coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses and filoviruses. Urine collected from Australian pteropid bats was assessed for the presence of paramyxoviruses. One of the viruses isolated was Teviot virus (TevPV), a novel rubulavirus previously isolated from pteropid bat urine throughout the east coast of Australia. Here, we further characterize TevPV through analysis of whole-genome sequencing, growth kinetics, antigenic relatedness and the experimental infection of ferrets and mice. TevPV is phylogenetically and antigenically most closely related to Tioman virus (TioPV). Unlike many other rubulaviruses, cell receptor attachment by TevPV does not appear to be sialic acid-dependent, with the receptor for host cell entry being unknown. The infection of ferrets and mice suggested that TevPV has a low pathogenic potential in mammals. Infected ferrets seroconverted by 10 days post-infection without clinical signs of disease. Furthermore, infected ferrets did not shed virus in any respiratory secretions, suggesting a low risk of onward transmission of TevPV. No productive infection was observed in the mouse infection study.																					WOS:000460158100007	30688635

The virus was found to be transmitted through Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum ticks. In this outbreak, 192 pigs between 2 and 4 mo. of age were affected. Forty-two pigs died during the outbreak. The survivors had stunted growth. Experimental pigs infected through the intradermal or scarification route with the suspension of scabs developed papules on the 5th day post-inoculation. The virus isolated from pigs failed to grow on the chorioallantoic membrane of 12 day old chicken embryos. Chicken, rabbit, guinea pigs, mice, rats, goats, sheep and hamsters were refractory to intradermal, scarification or s.c. inoculation of the virus suspension. The pigs that recovered from swine pox were fully susceptible to vaccinia infection.																					BCI:BCI197662032401

Evidence for SARS-CoV-2 Infection of Animal Hosts								PATHOGENS				9	7					529	10.3390/pathogens9070529				JUL 2020	2020	COVID-19 is the first known pandemic caused by a coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which is the third virus in the family Coronaviridae to cause fatal infections in humans after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Animals are involved in the COVID-19 pandemic. This review summarizes the role of animals as reservoirs, natural hosts and experimental models. SARS-CoV-2 originated from animal reservoir, most likely bats and/or pangolins. Anthroponotic transmission has been reported in cats, dogs, tigers, lions and minks. As of now, there is no a strong evidence for natural animal-to-human transmission or sustained animal-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Experimental infections conducted by several research groups have shown that monkeys, hamsters, ferrets, cats, tree shrews, transgenic mice and fruit bats were permissive, while dogs, pigs and poultry were resistant. There is an urgent need to understand the zoonotic potential of different viruses in animals, particularly in bats, before they transmit to humans. Vaccines or antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 should be evaluated not only for humans, but also for the protection of companion animals (particularly cats) and susceptible zoo and farm animals.

The virus distribution in the bats was evaluated by inoculating mice and N2A cells with 20% suspensions prepared from fragments of different organs and tissues, plus the brain and salivary glands. The time taken for mortality among the mice was monitored daily, following intracerebral inoculation.RESULTS: Out of the 4,395 bats received, 1.9% were found positive for the rabies virus. They belonged to ten genera, with predominance of insectivores. The maximum mean times taken for mortality among the mice following inoculation with brain and salivary gland material were 15.33 +/- 2.08 days and 11.33 +/- 2.30 days for vampire bats, 16.45 +/- 4.48 days and 18.91 +/- 6.12 days for insectivorous bats, and 12.60 +/- 2.13 days and 15.67 +/- 4.82 days for frugivorous bats, respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The species infected with the rabies virus were: Artibeus lituratus, Artibeus sp., Myotis nigricans, Myotis sp., Eptesicus sp., Lasiurus ega, Lasiurus cinereus, Nyctinomops laticaudatus, Tadarida brasiliensis, Histiotus velatus, Molossus rufus, Eumops sp. and Desmodus rotundus. Virus investigation in the different tissues and organs showed that the brain and salivary glands were the most suitable sites for virus isolation.																					WOS:000246654800010	17515992

Fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assays combine RT-PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, thereby eliminating post-PCR processing and potentially enhancing specificity. Consequently, a fluorogenic nuclease RTPCR assay specific for rodent coronaviruses was developed. Primer and probe sequences were selected from the viral genome segment that encodes the membrane (M) protein that is highly conserved among rodent coronaviruses. Use of the fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR detected all strains of MHV and RCV that were evaluated, but did not detect other RNA viruses that naturally infect rodents. Use of the assay detected as little as two femtograms of in vitro transcribed RNA generated from cloned amplicon, and when compared directly with mouse antibody production tests, had similar sensitivity at detecting MHV-A59 in infected cell culture lysates. Finally, use of the assay detected coronavirus RNA in tissues, cage swipes, and feces obtained from mice experimentally infected with MHV, and in tissues and cage swipes obtained from rats naturally infected with RCV. These results indicate that the fluorogenic nuclease RT-PCR assay should provide a potentially high-throughput, PCR-based method to detect rodent coronaviruses in infected rodents and contaminated biological materials.

Orthohantavirus Isolated in Reservoir Host Cells Displays Minimal Genetic Changes and Retains Wild-Type Infection Properties								VIRUSES-BASEL				12	4					457	10.3390/v12040457				APR 2020	2020	Orthohantaviruses are globally emerging zoonotic pathogens. While the reservoir host role of several rodent species is well-established, detailed research on the mechanisms of host-othohantavirus interactions has been constrained by the lack of an experimental system that is able to effectively replicate natural infections in controlled settings. Here we report the isolation, and genetic and phenotypic characterization of a novel Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) in cells derived from its reservoir host, the bank vole. The isolation process resulted in cell culture infection that evaded antiviral responses, persisted cell passaging, and had minor viral genome alterations. Critically, experimental infections of bank voles with the new isolate resembled natural infections in terms of viral load and host cell distribution. When compared to an attenuated Vero E6 cell-adapted PUUV Kazan strain, the novel isolate demonstrated delayed virus-specific humoral responses. A lack of virus-specific antibodies was also observed during experimental infections with wild-type PUUV, suggesting that delayed seroconversion could be a general phenomenon during orthohantavirus infection in reservoir hosts. Our results demonstrate that orthohantavirus isolation on cells derived from a vole reservoir host retains wild-type infection properties and should be considered the method of choice for experimental infection models to replicate natural processes.

However, when naturally infected 3-month-old chickens were treated with 13 ml of a serum with a high neutralizing antibody titer, mortality was 70%, or identical to that of the controls.

Development of an Acute and Highly Pathogenic Nonhuman Primate Model of Nipah Virus Infection								PLOS ONE				5	5					e10690	10.1371/journal.pone.0010690				MAY 18 2010	2010	Nipah virus (NiV) is an enigmatic emerging pathogen that causes severe and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease in both animals and humans. Amongst people, case fatality rates range between 40 and 75 percent and there are no vaccines or treatments approved for human use. Guinea pigs, hamsters, cats, ferrets, pigs and most recently squirrel monkeys (New World monkey) have been evaluated as animal models of human NiV infection, and with the exception of the ferret, no model recapitulates all aspects of NiV-mediated disease seen in humans. To identify a more viable nonhuman primate (NHP) model, we examined the pathogenesis of NiV in African green monkeys (AGM). Exposure of eight monkeys to NiV produced a severe systemic infection in all eight animals with seven of the animals succumbing to infection. Viral RNA was detected in the plasma of challenged animals and occurred in two of three subjects as a peak between days 7 and 21, providing the first clear demonstration of plasma-associated viremia in NiV experimentally infected animals and suggested a progressive infection that seeded multiple organs simultaneously from the initial site of virus replication. Unlike the cat, hamster and squirrel monkey models of NiV infection, severe respiratory pathology, neurological disease and generalized vasculitis all manifested in NiV-infected AGMs, providing an accurate reflection of what is observed in NiV-infected humans. Our findings demonstrate the first consistent and highly pathogenic NHP model of NiV infection, providing a new and critical platform in the evaluation and licensure of either passive and active immunization or therapeutic strategies for human use.

Fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays combine PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, eliminating post-PCR processing and potentially enhancing specificity. Consequently, three fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays were developed, one that detects all rodent parvoviruses, one that specifically detects minute virus of mice (MVM), and one that specifically detects mouse parvovirus 1 (MPV) and hamster parvovirus (HaPV). When rodent parvoviruses and other rodent DNA viruses were evaluated, the rodent parvovirus assay detected only rodent parvovirus isolates, whereas the MVM and MPV/HaPV assays detected only the MVM or MPV/HaPV isolates, respectively. Each assay detected the equivalent of 10 or fewer copies of target template, and all fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays exceeded the sensitivities associated with previously reported PCR assays and mouse antibody production testing. In addition, each fluorogenic nuclease PCR assay detected the targeted parvovirus DNA in tissues obtained from mice experimentally infected with MVM or MPV. Results of these studies indicate that fluorogenic nuclease PCR assays provide a potentially high-throughput, PCR-based method to detect rodent parvoviruses in infected mice and contaminated biological materials.

Clinical samples from calves suffering respiratory disease were also submitted to this test. IHC detected BRSV antigens in mouse tracheas (3, 5 and 7 days post-infection) and lungs (5 and 7 days post-infection), and in one of three lungs from experimentally infected calves. Lungs samples from two naturally infected calves were tested and resulted positive for BRSV by the IHC test. These results suggest that this test may be used in the future for diagnosis as well as a useful tool to assess the distribution of BRSV infections in Brazilian herds.

Bats are recognized carriers of emerging viral zoonoses and have been proposed as dengue reservoirs, since RNA/NS1 and/or antiviral antibodies have been detected. Yet, experimental inoculation of Artibeus bats failed to show virus replication. This conflicting results prevent drawing further conclusions of whether bats sustain dengue infection. To test bat cellular permissivity to dengue infection, we established primary bat embryonic cells from diverse organs and tissues of Artibeus jamaicensis, Molossus sinaloae, and Desmodus rotundus. We observed a limited serotype-, organ-, and bat species-specific dengue susceptibility. Only some Molossusderived primary cells sustained poorly initial Dengue serotype-1 replication, though it was latter absent. To elucidate if Molossus bats may play a role in dengue replication, ecological or in vivo experiments must be performed. Taken together our results show that Dengue did not replicate efficiently in cell lines derived from Neotropical bat species. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pathology of laboratory rodents and rabbits					Ed. 4			119	172						2016	2016	The genetic background of rats is as important a consideration as in mice for expression of disease. Rats are subject to infection with fewer viruses than mice but seem to make up for this with more clinically significant bacterial infections. This chapter presents some general references on diseases of rats caused by viral infections, bacterial infections, fungal infections, parasitic diseases and age-related disorders. Rats are host to their own rat-specific cytomegalovirus (RCMV). Hantaviruses have caused several laboratory rat-associated outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe, and these have been traced to infected rats from breeders, wild rodents, and experimentally infected rodents, as well as immunocytomass grown in laboratory rats. Rats are susceptible to a number of important bacterial pathogens that are primary enteric infections, primary respiratory infections, and other bacterial infections. Rats also develop a myriad of age-related lesions.																					CABI:20183300965

Distinct virus species are hosted by specific rodent reservoirs, which also serve as the vectors. Although regional spillover has been documented, it is unknown whether rodent reservoirs are competent for infection by hantaviruses that are geographically separated, and known to have related, but distinct rodent reservoir hosts. We show that Andes virus (ANDV) of South America, carried by the long tailed pygmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus), infects and replicates in vitro and in vivo in the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), the reservoir host of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), found in North America. In experimentally infected deer mice, viral RNA was detected in the blood, lung, heart and spleen, but virus was cleared by 56 days post inoculation (dpi). All of the inoculated deer mice mounted a humoral immune response by 14 dpi, and produced measurable amounts of neutralizing antibodies by 21 dpi. An up-regulation of Ccl3, Ccl4, Ccl5, and Tgfb, a strong CD4(+) T-cell response, and down-regulation of Il17, Il21 and Il23 occurred during infection. Infection was transient with an absence of clinical signs or histopathological changes. This is the first evidence that ANDV asymptomatically infects, and is immunogenic in deer mice, a non-natural host species of ANDV. Comparing the immune response in this model to that of the immune response in the natural hosts upon infection with their co-adapted hantaviruses may help clarify the mechanisms governing persistent infection in the natural hosts of hantaviruses.

The goal of this study was to investigate the replication and transmission of bovine FLUDV in guinea pigs. Following direct intranasal inoculation of animals, the virus was detected in nasal washes of infected animals during the first 7 days postinfection. High viral titers were obtained from nasal turbinates and lung tissues of directly inoculated animals. Further, bovine FLUDV was able to transmit from the infected guinea pigs to sentinel animals by means of contact and not by aerosol dissemination under the experimental conditions tested in this study. Despite exhibiting no clinical signs, infected guinea pigs developed seroconversion and the viral antigen was detected in lungs of animals by immunohistochemistry. The observation that bovine FLUDV replicated in the respiratory tract of guinea pigs was similar to observations described previously in studies of gnotobiotic calves and pigs experimentally infected with bovine FLUDV but different from those described previously in experimental infections in ferrets and swine with a swine FLUDV, which supported virus replication only in the upper respiratory tract and not in the lower respiratory tract, including lung. Our study established that guinea pigs could be used as an animal model for studying this newly emerging influenza virus.IMPORTANCEInfluenza D virus (FLUDV) is a novel emerging pathogen with bovine as its primary host. The epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus are not yet known. FLUDV also spreads to swine, and the presence of FLUDV-specific antibodies in humans could indicate that there is a potential for zoonosis. Our results showed that bovine FLUDV replicated in the nasal turbinate and lungs of guinea pigs at high titers and was also able to transmit from an infected animal to sentinel animals by contact. The fact that bovine FLUDV replicated productively in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts of guinea pigs, similarly to virus infection in its native host, demonstrates that guinea pigs would be a suitable model host to study the replication and transmission potential of bovine FLUDV.

Immunogenic and protective properties of the peptide constructs were studied in guinea pigs and mice of three lines. The constructs were shown to induce higher levels of antibodies and exhibit higher protective effects than the separate peptides. The most active among the peptides studied was the construct involving the VP1 fragments 135-160 and 170-190: it protected pigs from the experimental infection by the foot-and-mouth disease virus.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				33	7			531	536						2011	2011	In this study, a real-time RT-PCR assay based on TaqMan probe for detection of mouse proinflammatory cytokine gene IL-1beta and TNF-alpha was established, respectively. The assays were highly specific, sensitive and reproducible, of which the correlation coefficient of the standard curve was over 0.998, the sensitivity was 10 copies/L of standard recombinant plasmid and the coefficient of variation was less than 2 percent for both intra-assay and inter-assay. The established assays were used to detect IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA levels in brain, heart and spleen tissues of mice experimentally infected with porcine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) GXLC strain. The results showed that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha mRNA expression levels reached peak value at 4 day post EMCV infection, with a time correlation between the expression levels and the mortality of infected mice. The results indicated that the TaqMan real-time PCR assay could be used as an effective tool for detection and quantification of these proinflammatory cytokines.

The therapeutic potential of iORFV has been recognized in several models for difficult-to-treat disease areas such as chronic viral diseases, liver fibrosis or various forms of cancer.Methods: Guinea pigs were infected with Human Herpesvirus (HSV)-2 strain MS and treated with iORFV, Acyclovir (ACV) or placebo, respectively. Clinical score of herpes lesions and viral shedding was assessed over a period of 40 days. In addition, viral DNA in dorsal root ganglia was quantified at the end of the study.Results: Disease symptoms were minimal or absent in iORFV-treated guinea pigs but tended to be severe in animals treated with either ACV or placebo. The cumulated disease score was significantly reduced in iORFV-treated but not in ACV-or placebo-treated guinea pigs. In addition, treatment with iORFV, but not ACV or placebo, led to significant reduction of viral DNA load in dorsal root ganglia.Conclusion: iORFV effectively suppressed recurrences in guinea pigs experimentally infected with HSV. iORFV did not only reduce recurrent disease episodes but was, compared with ACV, more effective in reducing latency as measured by viral DNA detected in dorsal root ganglia of infected animals.

In order to investigate whether an adapted virus replication contributes to BDV persistence in vivo, a fast and reliable real-time RT-PCR assay was constructed to quantify the amounts of leader-containing (leBDV) as a marker for virus replication, genomic (vBDV) and nucleoprotein-(BDV-N +ssRNA)-specific RNA. Therefore, leBDV, vBDV and BDV-N +ssRNA values were determined in experimentally infected Lewis rats between 14 and 90 days post infection (dpi). Surprisingly low leBDV values were found compared to vBDV and the abundantly expressed BDV-N transcripts. vBDV multiplied only in the acute phase of infection followed by constant expression until 90 dpi. Ratios of vBDV to leBDV were 401:1 at 14 dpi and diminished to 209:1 at 90 dpi, indicating a regulated co-expression of replicative intermediates as a potential prerequisite for viral persistence.

Experimental transmission of endemic typhus fever by the sticktight flea, Echidnophaga gallinacea								JOUR WASHINGTON ACAD SCI				32	(2)			57	60						1942	1942	The virus of endemic typhus (Wilmington strain) has been successfully transferred to stick-tight fleas as a result of allowing the fleas to feed on an experimentally infected rat. An emulsion of the feces of these fleas and an emulsion of the body of these fleas produced clinical typhus when inoculated into guinea pigs. Clear-cut cross-immunity has been shown in guinea pigs inoculated with the virus from the fleas and with a known endemic typhus virus (Wilmington strain). Histological examination of the brain of one of the guinea pigs inoculated with the strain of virus recovered from the fleas revealed characteristic lesions of typhus fever. Agglutinins for B. proteus OX19 were demonstrated in the serum of a rabbit inoculated with the strain of virus recovered from the fleas. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19421600012883

Rabies and rabies-related viruses constitute one of the most important viral zoonoses and pose a significant threat to public health across the globe. Whereas rabies virus (RABV) appears to be restricted to bats of the New World, related lyssavirus species have not been detected in the Americas and have only been detected in bat populations across Africa, Eurasia, and Australia. Currently, 11 distinct species of lyssavirus have been identified, 10 of which have been isolated from bat species and all of which appear to be able to cause encephalitis consistent with that seen with RABV infection of humans. In contrast, whereas lyssaviruses are apparently able to cause clinical disease in bats, it appears that these lyssaviruses may also be able to circulate within bat populations in the absence of clinical disease. This feature of these highly encephalitic viruses, alongside many other aspects of lyssavirus infection in bats, is poorly understood. Here, we review what is known of the complex relationship between bats and lyssaviruses, detailing both natural and experimental infections of these viruses in both chiropteran and nonchiropteran models. We also discuss potential mechanisms of virus excretion, transmission both to conspecifics and spill-over of virus into nonvolant species, and mechanisms of maintenance within bat populations. Importantly, we review the significance of neutralizing antibodies reported within bat populations and discuss the potential mechanisms by which highly neurovirulent viruses such as the lyssaviruses are able to infect bat species in the absence of clinical disease.

Marburg Virus Persistence on Fruit as a Plausible Route of Bat to Primate Filovirus Transmission								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	12					2394	10.3390/v13122394				DEC 2021	2021	Marburg virus (MARV), the causative agent of Marburg virus disease, emerges sporadically in sub-Saharan Africa and is often fatal in humas. The natural reservoir for this zoonotic virus is the frugivorous Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) that when infected, sheds virus in the highest amounts in oral secretions and urine. Being fruit bats, these animals forage nightly for ripened fruit throughout the year, including those types often preferred by humans. During feeding, they continually discard partially eaten fruit on the ground that could then be consumed by other Marburg virus susceptible animals or humans. In this study, using qRT-PCR and virus isolation, we tested fruit discarded by Egyptian rousette bats experimentally infected with a natural bat isolate of Marburg virus. We then separately tested viral persistence on fruit varieties commonly cultivated in sub-Saharan Africa using a recombinant Marburg virus expressing the fluorescent ZsGreen1. Marburg virus RNA was repeatedly detected on fruit in the food bowls of the infected bats and viable MARV was recovered from inoculated fruit for up to 6 h.

An Early Passage Human Isolate of Kyasanur Forest Disease Virus Shows Acute Neuropathology in Experimentally Infected CD-1 Mice								VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES				16	7			496	498		10.1089/vbz.2015.1917				JUL 2016	2016	Background: Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV) is a tick-borne Flavivirus that causes a severe illness in humans. Disease spectrum can vary from subclinical infection to fatal cases with hemorrhagic complications. The pathology of KFDV remains incompletely understood.Methods: This study describes the histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings in experimentally infected infant CD-1 mice with an early passage human KFDV isolate.Results: Acute histological changes were primarily seen in the brain. The spectrum of changes included gliosis, inflammatory response, necrosis, neural loss, and syncytium formation in mid and hind brain structures. Microscopic lesions observed in the liver were mainly necrosis and vacuolation of hepatocytes and in small intestine, prominent epithelial cell necrosis. KFDV antigens could be stained by a sensitive immunohistochemical labeling in the same organs.Conclusions: Findings from this study are suggestive of neuropathology as the main manifestation of an early passaged human KFDV isolate. Importantly, this suggests that KFDV may be causing primarily a neurologic disease and secondary organ damage could be because of disease pathology per se. The use of primary low passage human isolates and neuropathology profile could also be more apt in developing a challenge model for testing potential antivirals and therapeutic agents.

In this study, the luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), employing the spike (S) and nucleocapsid proteins (N) of SARS-CoV-2, was used to examine the suitability of the assay for antibody detection in different animal species. Sera from SARS-CoV-2 naturally-infected mink (n = 77), SARS-CoV-2 experimentally-infected ferrets, fruit bats and hamsters and a rabbit vaccinated with a purified spike protein were examined for antibodies using the SARS-CoV-2 N and/or S proteins. From comparison with the known neutralization status of the serum samples, statistical analyses including calculation of the Spearman rank-order-correlation coefficient and Cohen's kappa agreement were used to interpret the antibody results and diagnostic performance. The LIPS immunoassay robustly detected the presence of viral antibodies in naturally infected SARS-CoV-2 mink, experimentally infected ferrets, fruit bats and hamsters as well as in an immunized rabbit. For the SARS-CoV-2-LIPS-S assay, there was a good level of discrimination between the positive and negative samples for each of the five species tested with 100% agreement with the virus neutralization results. In contrast, the SARS-CoV-2-LIPS-N assay did not consistently differentiate between SARS-CoV-2 positive and negative sera. This study demonstrates the suitability of the SARS-CoV-2-LIPS-S assay for the sero-surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a range of animal species.

Restricted expression of Borna disease virus glycoprotein in brains of experimentally infected Lewis rats								NEUROPATHOLOGY AND APPLIED NEUROBIOLOGY				34	6			590	602		10.1111/j.1365-2990.2008.00940.x				DEC 2008	2008	Aim: Borna disease virus (BDV) induces a persistent infection in the central nervous system (CNS) accompanied by a non-purulent meningoencephalitis. BDV-infection of Lewis rats provides an important model to investigate basic principles of neurotropism, viral persistence and resulting dysfunctions. To date, the in vivo strategies of BDV to persist in the CNS are not fully understood. Viral glycoproteins are main targets of the antiviral defence implicating a controlled expression in case of persistent infections. Therefore, we analysed the expression profiles of the BDV-glycoprotein (BDV-GP) and corresponding BDV-intron II RNA in experimentally infected rat brains, focusing on their spatio-temporal occurrence, regional, cellular and intracellular locations. Methods: This was carried out by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The expression pattern of the most abundantly expressed BDV-nucleoprotein (BDV-N) served as a reference. Results: BDV-N mRNA was detected preferentially in the cytoplasm of neurones, whereas BDV-intron II mRNA was found predominantly in the nucleus of brain cells. The genomic RNA was restricted to the nucleus. Expression of BDV-GP was significantly lower than BDV-N expression and mainly limited to cerebral cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and thalamus. BDV-GP was restricted to larger neurones; BDV-N occurred also in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells. Conclusions: The expression profiles of BDV-GP, BDV-N and their mRNAs are significantly different, indicating that BDV-GP expression is regulated in vivo. This might be achieved by restricted nuclear export and/or maturation of BDV-intron II mRNA or limited translation as a viral mechanism to escape from the immune response and enable persistence in the CNS.

J	Lee, BJ; Watanabe, M; Kamitani, W; Baba, S; Yamashita, M; Kobayashi, T; Tomonaga, K; Ikuta, K								Age- and host-dependent control of Borna disease virus spread in the developing brains of gerbils and rats								MICROBES AND INFECTION				5	13			1195	1204		10.1016/j.micinf.2003.07.007				NOV 2003	2003	Borna disease virus (BDV) is a non-cytolytic, neurotropic RNA virus that has a broad host range in warm-blooded animals, probably including humans. Recently, we have demonstrated that the neonatal gerbil is a unique model for analyzing BDV-induced acute neurological disease. In this report, to understand the effects of the brain development of gerbils in BDV-induced neuropathogenesis, as well as to investigate the host-dependent differences in BDV propagation and pathogenesis in the brains, we performed experimental infection of BDV using two different infant rodent models, gerbils and rats. We demonstrated here that most of the gerbils infected with BDV on postnatal days (PD) 14, but not on PD I and PD7, could survive neurological disorders during the observation period of PD85. Interestingly, the levels of BDV RNA and antigen in surviving PD 14 inoculated gerbil brains were extremely low, whereas diseased gerbils and both PD7 and PD 14 inoculated rats contained significant amounts of BDV antigen in the central nervous system, suggesting that PD14 gerbils successfully controlled BDV spread in the brain. Furthermore, the viral distribution, as well as the expression levels of cytokine and CD8 mRNAs, in the brains was markedly different between the rodent models and between diseased and non-diseased statuses of the gerbils. These results demonstrated that developmentally regulated and host-specific factors could contribute to the prevention of BDV spread in developing animal brains. Studies using different animal systems would provide novel insights into the mechanisms of host defense responses to neurotropic virus infections.

Heating the milk for 20 s at temp. between 58 and 90 deg C resulted in a rapid decrease in viral activity (determined in assays with mice) between 60 and 68 deg C. Above 70 deg C only slight activity remained, but it was detectable if sufficient test mice were used. Similar results were obtained when milk was heated at 60 deg C for 320 s. The results demonstrate the heat resistance of the foot and mouth virus.																					CABI:19770431781

A control group of eight guinea-pigs was inoculated intraperitoneally with the same isolate in order to confirm virulence. Three of eight infected guinea-pigs developed clinical signs 7-9 days post-inoculation. Infected fruit bats developed a subclinical. infection characterized by the transient presence of virus within selected viscera, episodic viral excretion and seroconversion. A range of histopathological changes was observed within the tissues of infected bats. Nipah virus was excreted in bat urine while neutralizing antibody was present in serum. This intermittent, low-level excretion of Nipah virus in the urine of bats may be sufficient to sustain the net reproductive value of the virus in a species where there is regular urine contamination of the fur, mutual grooming, and where urine droplets are a feature of the environment.

J	Leech, Stacey; Baker, Michelle L.								The interplay between viruses and the immune system of bats								MICROBIOLOGY AUSTRALIA				38	1			30	32		10.1071/MA17010				MAR 2017	2017	Bats are an abundant and diverse group of mammals with an array of unique characteristics, including their wellknown roles as natural reservoirs for a variety of viruses. These include the deadly zoonotic paramyxoviruses; Hendra(HeV) andNipah(NiV)(1,2), lyssaviruses(3), coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(4) andfiloviruses such as Marburg(5). Although these viruses are highly pathogenic in other species, including humans, bats rarely show clinical signs of disease whilst maintaining the ability to transmit virus to susceptible vertebrate hosts. In addition, bats are capable of clearing experimental infections with henipaviruses, filoviruses and lyssaviruses at doses of infection that are lethal in other mammals(6-12). Curiously, the ability of bats to tolerate viral infections does not appear to extend to extracellular pathogens such as bacteria, fungi and parasites(13). Over the past few years, considerable headway has been made into elucidating the mechanisms responsible for the ability of bats to control viral replication, with evidence for unique differences in the innate immune responses of bats(14-20). However, many questions remain around mechanisms responsible for the ability of bats to co-exist with viruses, including their ability to tolerate constitutive immune activation, the triggers associated with viral spillover events and the sites of viral replication. Although bats appear to have all of the major componentsof theimmunesystempresent in other species, their unique ecological characteristics (including flight, high density populations and migration) combined with their long co-evolutionary history with viruses has likely shaped their immune response resulting in an equilibrium between the host and its pathogens.

Experimental Lagos bat virus infection in straw-colored fruit bats: A suitable model for bat rabies in a natural reservoir species								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				14	12					e0008898	10.1371/journal.pntd.0008898				DEC 2020	2020	Rabies is a fatal neurologic disease caused by lyssavirus infection. Bats are important natural reservoir hosts of various lyssaviruses that can be transmitted to people. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of rabies in bats are poorly understood, making it difficult to prevent zoonotic transmission. To further our understanding of lyssavirus pathogenesis in a natural bat host, an experimental model using straw-colored fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and Lagos bat virus, an endemic lyssavirus in this species, was developed. To determine the lowest viral dose resulting in 100% productive infection, bats in five groups (four bats per group) were inoculated intramuscularly with one of five doses, ranging from 10(0.1) to 10(4.1) median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50). More bats died due to the development of rabies after the middle dose (10(2.1) TCID50, 4/4 bats) than after lower (10(1.1), 2/4; 10(1.1), 2/4) or higher (10(3.1), 2/4; 10(4.1), 2/4) doses of virus. In the two highest dose groups, 4/8 bats developed rabies. Of those bats that remained healthy 3/4 bats seroconverted, suggesting that high antigen loads can trigger a strong immune response that abrogates a productive infection. In contrast, in the two lowest dose groups, 3/8 bats developed rabies, 1/8 remained healthy and seroconverted and 4/8 bats remained healthy and did not seroconvert, suggesting these doses are too low to reliably induce infection. The main lesion in all clinically affected bats was meningoencephalitis associated with lyssavirus-positive neurons. Lyssavirus antigen was detected in tongue epithelium (5/11 infected bats) rather than in salivary gland epithelium (0/11), suggesting viral excretion via the tongue. Thus, intramuscular inoculation of 10(2.1) TCID50 of Lagos bat virus into straw-colored fruit bats is a suitable model for lyssavirus associated bat rabies in a natural reservoir host, and can help with the investigation of lyssavirus infection dynamics in bats.Author summaryRabies is a fatal neurologic disease affecting people and animals. Rabies is caused by infection with a virus of the genus Lyssavirus. People usually get infected from dog bites, but bats are an increasingly important source of the disease. To better understand the biology of rabies in bats, we developed a laboratory model to study the disease in bats under controlled circumstances. For this model we used Lagos bat virus in straw-colored fruit bats and, as part of its development, we wanted to know the best virus dose to use to cause rabies. Therefore, we compared the outcomes of five different virus doses injected into the muscle of the bats. The best dose for our model was the middle dose, which caused rabies more frequently than either the highest or the lowest doses. The higher doses more frequently resulted in the development of an anti-viral immune response which appeared to protect against disease, while bats with low doses also often failed to develop disease. The virus dose thus followed the Goldilocks principle, with the middle dose being just right.																					WOS:000600200300006	33320860

Pathology research international				2011				567248	567248		10.4061/2011/567248				2011	2011	Zoonoses as causes of human infections have been increasingly reported, and many of these are viruses that cause central nervous system infections. This paper focuses on the henipaviruses (family Paramyxoviridae, genus henipavirus) that have recently emerged to cause severe encephalitis and systemic infection in humans and animals in the Asia-Pacific region. The pathological features in the human infections comprise vasculopathy (vasculitis, endothelial multinucleated syncytia, thrombosis, etc.) and parenchymal cell infection in the central nervous system, lung, kidney, and other major organs. Most animals naturally or experimentally infected show more or less similar features confirming the dual pathogenetic mechanism of vasculopathy-associated microinfarction and direct extravascular parenchymal cell infection as causes of tissue injury. The most promising animal models include the hamster, ferret, squirrel monkey, and African green monkey. With increasing evidence of infection in the natural hosts, the pteropid bats and, hence, probable future outbreaks in many more countries, a greater awareness of henipavirus infection in both humans and animals is imperative.

Inoculation of ARctl into the infected recipients is accompanied by the nonspecific suppression of the immune response and transformation of the asymptomatic Langat infection into an acute one. The thymus of the infected mice contains T-suppressors which inhibit ARctl differentiation and prevent the development of the autoimmune disease and transformation of the asymptomatic infection into the acute.

To assess the possibility of using Mongolian gerbils as animal model, 28 gerbils were randomly assigned into two groups, 14 for each group. Gerbils in Group 1 were inoculated with a genotype 4 HEV recovered from swine via the intraperitoneal route. Group 2 was used as a negative control and inoculated with normal suspension of swine liver. Sera and feces samples were collected once a week for 7 weeks. Two gerbils from both groups were necropsied weekly, pathological changes were recorded and tissue samples collected for further investigation. Distribution of the virus antigens was determined by immunohistochemical staining. Nested RT-PCR and a commercial ELISA kit were used to confirm the infection. Research results demonstrated that Mongolian gerbils in Group 1 were successfully infected with HEV. Viremia and fecal virus shedding lasted nearly 4 weeks, while the virus could be detected constantly in the liver, and occasionally in the kidneys and spleen as well as the small intestine. Histopathological changes in the liver were present with slight, multifocal, lymphohistiocytic infiltrates in the portal tracts or distributed irregularly throughout the liver. HEV antigens could be detected in the liver and intestine, and were mainly distributed in the nuclei. The results indicate that Mongolian gerbils could be used as an ideal animal model for the study of HEV. J. Med. Viral. 81:1591-1596, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Black rats (Rattus rattus) as potential reservoir hosts for Rift Valley fever phlebovirus: Experimental infection results in viral replication and shedding without clinical manifestation								TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES											10.1111/tbed.14093		MAY 2021			2021	Rift Valley fever phlebovirus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that can cause severe disease in ruminants and humans. Epidemics occur mainly after heavy rainfall, which leads to a significant increase in the occurrence of RVFV-transmitting mosquitoes. During inter-epidemic periods, the virus is assumed to be maintained between mosquitoes, susceptible livestock and yet unknown wildlife. The widespread rodent Rattus rattus (black rat) has been suspected to be involved in RVFV maintenance. In order to elucidate its susceptibility and thus its possible role in the transmission cycle of the virus, an experimental infection study was performed. Black rats were subcutaneously infected with highly virulent RVFV strain 35/74 and euthanized on days 3, 14 and 28 post-infection. Additional black rats served as non-infected contact animals. The infected black rats showed high susceptibility to RVFV infection. Generation of RVFV-neutralizing antibodies was found, and the rats developed viraemias lasting up to 17 days. Viral RNA was found in tissues until the last day of the experiment. However, neither a clinical manifestation nor virus-induced histopathological lesions were observed in any rat. These findings indicate the persistence of RVFV in black rats without affecting the animals. In contact animals, no evidence of horizontal RVFV transmission was found, although the co-housed infected rats showed oral, rectal and conjunctival RVFV shedding. Results of this study point to an involvement of black rats in the RVFV transmission cycle, and further studies are needed to investigate their potential role in the maintenance of the virus.

A canine influenza virus (ZJ0110) was isolated from the lung of a deceased Tibetan mastiff and was characterized in detail. Sequence analysis indicated that the 8 genes of the canine isolate were most similar to those of avian-origin canine influenza viruses (H3N2) isolated in South Korea in 2007, with which they shared >98% sequence identity. ZJ0110 could experimentally infect 6-month-old beagles by intranasal inoculation and by airborne transmission, causing severe respiratory syndrome. Moreover, ZJ0110 could replicate in the upper respiratory tracts of mice and guinea pigs, and the virus titer was comparable to that in the upper respiratory tracts of dogs. Although the virus was genetically of avian origin, ZJ0110 could not experimentally infect chicken or ducks by intranasal inoculation. These results suggest that dogs might be an intermediary host in which avian influenza viruses adapt to replicate in mammals. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The mechanisms by which these viruses are maintained in individuals or populations of reservoir bats remain an enigma. Mathematical models have predicted long-term persistent infection with low levels of periodic shedding as a likely route for virus maintenance and spillover from bats. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that bat cells and MERS coronavirus (CoV) can co-exist in vitro. To test our hypothesis, we established a long-term coronavirus infection model of bat cells that are persistently infected with MERS-CoV. We infected cells from Eptesicus fuscus with MERS-CoV and maintained them in culture for at least 126 days. We characterized the persistently infected cells by detecting virus particles, protein and transcripts. Basal levels of type I interferon in the long-term infected bat cells were higher, relative to uninfected cells, and disrupting the interferon response in persistently infected bat cells increased virus replication. By sequencing the whole genome of MERS-CoV from persistently infected bat cells, we identified that bat cells repeatedly selected for viral variants that contained mutations in the viral open reading frame 5 (ORF5) protein. Furthermore, bat cells that were persistently infected with Delta ORF5 MERS-CoV were resistant to superinfection by wildtype virus, likely due to reduced levels of the virus receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and higher basal levels of interferon in these cells. In summary, our study provides evidence for a model of coronavirus persistence in bats, along with the establishment of a unique persistently infected cell culture model to study MERS-CoV-bat interactions.

The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay has proven useful for the detection of Reo-3 in rodents and contaminated biological materials. Fluorogenic nuclease reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays (fnRT-PCR) combine RT-PCR with an internal fluorogenic hybridization probe, thereby potentially enhancing specificity and eliminating post-PCR processing. Therefore, an fnRT-PCR assay specific for Reo-3 was developed by targeting primer and probe sequences to a unique region of the Reo-3 M3 gene. The fnRT-PCR detected both strains of Reo-3 (Dearing and Abney), but did not detect Reovirus types 1 or 2, other viruses in the family Reoviridae, or other RNA viruses that naturally infect rodents. The fnRT-PCR detected less than 1 fg of target template and detected viral RNA in tissues obtained from mice experimentally infected with Reo-3. The assay also displayed comparable sensitivity when compared to the mouse antibody production test commonly used to detect viral contamination of biological materials. in conclusion, this fnRT-PCR assay offers a potentially high-throughput diagnostic assay for detecting Reo-3 RNA in infected mice and contaminated biological materials.

Three Immunocompetent Small Animal Models That Do Not Support Zika Virus Infection								PATHOGENS				10	8					971	10.3390/pathogens10080971				AUG 2021	2021	Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is primarily transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. ZIKV causes disease in infected humans with added complications of Guillain-Barre syndrome and birth defects in infants born to mothers infected during pregnancy. There are several large immunocompetent animal models for ZIKV including non-human primates (NHPs). NHP models closely reflect human infection; however, due to sample size restrictions, investigations into the effects of transmission route and the impacts on disease dynamics have been understudied. Mice have been widely used for modeling ZIKV infection, yet there are few ZIKV-susceptible immunocompetent mouse models and none of these have been used to investigate sexual transmission. In an effort to identify a small immunocompetent animal model to characterize sexual transmission of ZIKV, we attempt experimental infection of multimammate mice, New Zealand white rabbits, and Hartley guinea pigs. The multimammate mouse is the natural reservoir of Lassa fever virus and has been identified to harbor other human pathogens. Likewise, while NZW rabbits are susceptible to West Nile virus, they have not yet been examined for their susceptibility to infection with ZIKV. Guinea pigs have been successfully used as models for ZIKV infection, but only in immunocompromised life stages (young or pregnant). Here, it was found that the multimammate mouse and New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits are not susceptible ZIKV infection as determined by a lack viral RNA in tissues and fluids collected. Sexually mature male Hartley guinea pigs were inoculated subcutaneously and by mosquito bite, but found to be refractory to ZIKV infection, contrary to findings of other studies in young and pregnant guinea pigs. Interestingly, here it is shown that adult male guinea pigs are not susceptible to ZIKV infection, even when infected by natural route (e.g., mosquito bite). Although a new small animal model for the sexual transmission for ZIKV was not established through this study, these findings provide information on outbred animal species that are not permissive to infection (NZW rabbits and multimammate mice) and new information surrounding limitations of a previously established animal model (guinea pigs).

Serological surveys have suggested wild rodents as the main CPXV reservoir. We characterized a CPXV isolated during a large-scale screening from a feral common vole. A comparison of the full-length DNA sequence of this CPXV strain with a highly virulent pet rat CPXV isolate showed a sequence identity of 96%, including a large additional open reading frame (ORF) of about 6,000 nucleotides which is absent in the reference CPXV strain Brighton Red. Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that the vole isolate, in contrast to the rat strain, forms A-type inclusion (ATI) bodies with incorporated virions, consistent with the presence of complete ati and p4c genes. Experimental infections showed that the vole CPXV strain caused only mild clinical symptoms in its natural host, while all rats developed severe respiratory symptoms followed by a systemic rash. In contrast, common voles infected with a high dose of the rat CPXV showed severe signs of respiratory disease but no skin lesions, whereas infection with a low dose led to virus excretion with only mild clinical signs. We concluded that the common vole is susceptible to infection with different CPXV strains. The spectrum ranges from well-adapted viruses causing limited clinical symptoms to highly virulent strains causing severe respiratory symptoms. In addition, the low pathogenicity of the vole isolate in its eponymous host suggests a role of common voles as a major CPXV reservoir, and future research will focus on the correlation between viral genotype and phenotype/pathotype in accidental and reservoir species.IMPORTANCEWe report on the first detection and isolation of CPXV from a putative reservoir host, which enables comparative analyses to understand the infection cycle of these zoonotic orthopox viruses and the relevant genes involved. In vitro studies, including whole-genome sequencing as well as in vivo experiments using the Wistar rat model and the vole reservoir host allowed us to establish links between genomic sequences and the in vivo properties (virulence) of the novel vole isolate in comparison to those of a recent zoonotic CPXV isolated from pet rats in 2009. Furthermore, the role of genes present only in a reservoir isolate can now be further analyzed. These studies therefore allow unique insights and conclusions about the role of the rodent reservoir in CPXV epidemiology and transmission and about the zoonotic threat that these viruses represent.

To date, all rabies virus (RABV) studies in bats have been performed in wild caught animals. Determining the RABV exposure history of a wild caught bat based on the presence or absence of viral neutralizing antibodies (VNA) may be misleading. Previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of VNA following natural or experimental inoculation is often ephemeral. With this knowledge, it is difficult to determine if a seronegative, wild caught bat has been previously exposed to RABV. The influence of prior rabies exposure in healthy, wild caught bats is unknown. To investigate the pathogenesis of RABV infection in bats born in captivity (naive bats), naive bats were inoculated intramuscularly with one of two Eptesicus fuscus rabies virus variants, EfV1 or EfV2. To determine the host response to a heterologous RABV, a separate group of naive bats were inoculated with a Lasionycteris noctivagans RABV (LnV1). Six months following the first inoculation, all bats were challenged with EfV2. Our results indicate that naive bats may have some level of innate resistance to intramuscular RABV inoculation.

Vertical transmission of tick-borne encephalitis virus between generations of adapted reservoir small rodents								VIRUS RESEARCH				140	1-2			172	178		10.1016/j.virusres.2008.12.001				MAR 2009	2009	Vertical transmission of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) between generations of the small rodents-red voles Myodes rutilus Pallas (previously known as Clethrionomys rutilus Pallas) was shown for naturally infected reservoir hosts and after experimental infection with different sublethal doses of the viral strains. For wild red voles and for their progeny born in 240-280 days after experimental infection of their parents the TBEV was detected in up to 90% of samples by RT-PCR, ELISA and bioassays. Small amounts of the TBEV RNA found in embryos, placenta and blood cells could serve as evidence of prenatal transmission. Postnatal transfer of the virus might occur through the rodent milk. Analysis of the TBEV E gene nucleotide sequences of RT-PCR products revealed missense mutations resulting in amino acid substitution K280Q in newborn red vole in comparison with its parent female.Taken together, the data confirmed the TBEV vertical transmission among generations of its adapted mammal reservoir hosts. The virus transfer might occur before, during and/or after birth of the small rodents with high frequencies. In the wild it could provide the TBEV long-term persistence in mammal hosts without an (any) involvement of arthropod vectors thus selecting dangerous mammal-adapted variants. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

J	van Ginneken, Vincent; Sitnyakowsky, Laura; Jeffery, Jonathan E.								Infectobesity: viral infections (especially with human adenovirus-36: Ad-36) may be a cause of obesity								MEDICAL HYPOTHESES				72	4			383	388		10.1016/j.mehy.2008.11.034				APR 2009	2009	In recent years viral infections have been recognized as possible cause of obesity, alongside the traditionally recognized causes (genetic inheritance, and behaviour/environmental causes such as diet exercise, cultural practices and stress). Although four viruses have been reported to induce obesity (infectoobesity) in animal models (chickens, mice, sheep, goat, dogs, rats and hamsters), until recently the viral etiology of human obesity has not received sufficient attention, possibly because the four viruses are not able to infect humans. In a series of papers over the last ten years, however, the group of Prof. Dhurandhar (Pennington Biomedical Research Center, LA, USA) demonstrated that a human adenovirus, adenovirus-36 (Ad-36), is capable of inducing adiposity in experimentally infected chickens, mice and non-human primates (marmosets). Ad-36 is known to increase the replication, differentiation, lipid accumulation and insulin sensitivity in fat cells and reduces those cells' leptin secretion and expression. It also affects human primary preadipocytes. In rats increased adiposity was observed due to Ad-36 infection. Recent studies have shown that, in the USA, antibodies to Ad-36 were more prevalent in obese subjects (30%) than in non-obese subjects (11%). We postulate that Ad-36 may be a contributing factor to the worldwide rising problem of obesity. We Suggest the extension of comparative virological studies between North America and Europe, and studies between discordant twins (both dizygous and monozygous). (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The natural hosts of these pathogens are thought to be bats. The rousette bat, a megabat, is thought to be a natural reservoir of filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg viruses. Additionally, the rousette bat showed a transient infection in the experimental inoculation of SARS-CoV-2. In the current study, we established and characterized intestinal organoids from Leschenault's rousette, Rousettus leschenaultii. The established organoids successfully recapitulated the characteristics of intestinal epithelial structure and morphology, and the appropriate supplements necessary for long-term stable culture were identified. The organoid showed susceptibility to Pteropine orthoreovirus (PRV) but not to SARS-CoV-2 in experimental inoculation. This is the first report of the establishment of an expandable organoid culture system of the rousette bat intestinal organoid and its sensitivity to bat-associated viruses, PRV and SARS-CoV-2. This organoid is a useful tool for the elucidation of tolerance mechanisms of the emerging rousette bat-associated viruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus.

In spite of this, little is known about pathogenesis of OROV infection. This report describes an experimental model of OROV in golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Following subcutaneous inoculation of OROV, over 50% of the animals developed disease characterized by lethargy, ruffled fur, shivering, paralysis, and approximately one third died. Animals were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 11 post-inoculation to collect tissue samples from brain, heart, liver, lung, spleen, muscle and blood for virus titration, histology and OROV immunohistochemistry. OROV was detected in high titers in blood, liver and brain, but not in the other organs. Histopathology revealed meningoencephalitis and hepatitis, with abundant OROV antigen detected in liver and brain. Diffuse galectin-3 immunostaining in brain and liver supports microglial and Kupfer cells activation. This is the first description of an experimental model for OROV infection and should be helpful to study pathogenesis and possibly to test antiviral interventions such as drugs and vaccine candidates.

Considering that experimentally infected mice eliminate viral particles in their feces, we investigated the presence of VACV in the feces and urine of wild rodents that were captured in the forest areas surrounding milking farms in the central west region of SAo Paulo State. For the first time, this work reports the detection of VACV by PCR in the feces of naturally infected Oligoryzomys flavescens, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and Sooretamys angouya, and in the urine of Oligorizomys flavescens, which raises important questions about the spread of VACV by rodent feces and its potential to induce clinical infections in cows.

The material comprised 98 mice infected with the virus and 30 control mice which were injected with suspensions of healthy mouse brains. Histologic changes were found in the virus-infected mice after 1, 6, 10 and 42 days. At first these changes were characterized by disorders of local circulation in the form of edema of the bone marrow and extravasation of blood. In the shafts of the bones longitudinal cleavage of bony tissue was observed, and in the epiphyses and neighboring parts of the bone chaotic necrosis. The most characteristic histologic change in the marrow and bones consisted in proliferation of marrow tissue of a type not encountered in other known diseases of the bones. This was accompanied by degenerative changes in the marrow, the proportion between the 2 types of changes being variable. In later stages regeneration of bone through metaplasia of newly-formed cartilage occurred. The muscular lesions were not different from those caused by other viruses. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19624000007537	14470040

Dissertation Abstracts International				40B	9			4162	4162						1980	1980	Neither Aujeszky's virus nor neutralizing antibodies against this virus were detected in tissue samples and serum samples from wild rats trapped in an Aujeszky's disease area or in experimentally infected rats. In addition there was no evidence of contact infections in experimentally infected rats. It is considered that rats have limited importance in the epidemiology of Aujeszky's disease. Results are also given from several experiments to evaluate cell-mediated immune response in vaccinated pigs, Aujeszky's virus excretion patterns and investigation of latent infection in experimentally infected pigs.

We previously reported that the pathogenicity of this strain could be reproduced in dogs and cats. In the present study, the host tropism of H3N2 CIV was examined by experimental inoculation into several host species, including chickens, pigs, mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets. The CIV infection resulted in no overt symptoms of disease in these host species. However, sero-conversion, virus shedding, and gross and histopathologic lung lesions were observed in guinea pig and ferrets but not in pigs, or mice. Based on the genetic similarity of our H3N2 CIV with currently circulating avian influenza viruses and the presence of alpha-2,3-linked rather than alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid receptors in the respiratory tract of dogs, we believed that this strain of CIV would have avian virus-like receptor specificity, but that seems to be contrary to our findings in the present study. Further studies are needed to determine the co-receptors of hemagglutinin or post-attachment factors related to virus internalization or pathogenesis in other animals. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A BAV-3 strain was isolated from a bovine nasal swab for the first time in China in 2009 and named HLJ0955. Subsequently, BAV-3 has frequently been isolated from calves with respiratory diseases in China. To date, only limited study on the pathogenesis of BAV-3 infection in cotton rats has been conducted, and the pathogenesis of BAV-3 infection in guinea pigs has not been reported. Therefore, sixteen albino guinea pigs were inoculated intranasally with HLJ0955. All of the infected guinea pigs had apparently elevated rectal temperatures (39.2 A degrees C-39.9 A degrees C) at 2-7 days post-inoculation (PI). Consolidation and petechial hemorrhage were also observed in guinea pigs experimentally infected with HLJ0955. Viral replication was detectable by virus isolation and titration and by immunohistochemistry in the lungs of guinea pigs as early as 24 h PI. Viral DNA was detectable in the lungs of infected guinea pigs during 11 days of observation by real-time PCR. Virus-neutralizing antibodies against BAV-3 were detectable from 11 days PI and reached a peak titer at 15 days PI. Histopathological changes mainly occurred in the lungs of infected guinea pigs and were characterized by thickening of alveolar septa, mononuclear cell infiltration, hemorrhage and alveolar epithelial necrosis. These results indicate that HLJ0955 can replicate in the lungs of guinea pigs and cause fever and gross and histological lesions. The guinea pig infection model of BAV-3 would serve as a useful system for monitoring the infection process and pathogenesis of the Chinese BAV-3 strain HLJ0955, as well as immune responses to BAV-3 vaccines.

Only recently, the virus has been reported to cause sporadic fatal disease in carnivores, and its zoonotic potential has been dominating the popular media. Attention to felids was drawn by two outbreaks with high mortality in tigers, leopards and other exotic felids in Thailand. Subsequently, domestic cats were found naturally infected and experimentally susceptible to H5N1 virus. A high susceptibility of the dog to H3N8 equine influenza A virus had been reported earlier, and recently also HPAI H5N1 virus has been identified as a canine pathogen. The ferret, hamster and mouse are suitable as experimental animals; importantly, these species are also kept as pets. Experimental intratracheal and oral infection of cats with an HPAI H5N1 virus isolate from a human case resulted in lethal disease; furthermore, cats have been infected by the feeding of infected chickens. Spread of the infection from experimentally infected to in-contact cats has been reported. The epidemiological role of the cat and other pet animal species in transmitting HPAI H5N1 virus to humans needs continuous consideration and attention. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It belongs to the family Herpesviridae, the genus Rhadinovirus, the species Murid herpesvirus 4. Neutralizing serum MHV-68 antibodies were found in animals of other species living with infected rodents in the same biotope (fallow deer, wild boars, deer, sheep, foxes, and mouflons) as well as in humans (laboratory personnel working with MHV-68 or wild rodents, hunters, general population). In this study, the shedding of MHV-68 in the nature was investigated on the model of laboratory mice experimentally infected with the virus. The virus was first detected in breast milk and lactic glands at day 4, in urine and salivary glands at day 9, and in saliva and tear glands at day 14 p.i. Out of intranasal, peroral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, and subcutaneous routes of infection the first two proved most effective.																					WOS:000259141400024

In the autumn of 1957 from Grocethia alba Pall. a virus pathogenic for guinea pigs, white rats, mice, chicks and pigeons but not pathogenic for rabbits was isolated. Experimental infection had a course similar to haemorrhagic toxicosis and caused the death of the animals within 3-4 days. The virus multiplied well in developing chick embryos and caused typical lesions on the chorioallantoic membrane and in the body of the embryo. The virus resisted freezing, drying and heating at 60[degree] for 30 min. Recovery from the disease did not confer resistance to reinfection. The sera of animals immunized with suspensions of the organs of infected white mice did not display neutralizing activity with different exposure times in the warm and in the cold. Suspensions of the organs of infected animals and chick embryos containing the virus to high titre did not agglutinate the red cells of man, horse, dog, sheep, rabbit, guinea pig, white rat and mouse, pigeon, chick embryo or the sparrow. The virus was partially inactivated in vitro by large doses of streptomycin. The sera of immunized animals did not react with the antigens of the agents of ornithosis and tick-borne encephalitis, fever, Central Asian tick-borne typhus and epidemic and murine typhus. The antigen prepared from the organs of infected animals did not fix complement on testing with antisera to ornithosis, yellow fever and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The agent isolated differed from all the other viruses pathogenic for humans, mammals and birds known to us. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19613600034625

The survival rate in strain XJ-infected 2 day old rats was 95%, but fell to 45% in cyclophosphamide-treated infected animals. Barely 5% of the rats inoculated with the XJC13 strain survived, while the cyclophosphamide suppressive treatment increased the rate to 36%. The XJ strain appears to produce a subclinical infection in 2 day old rats and the host immune mechanisms are responsible for recovery from the viral infection. Adequate immunosuppression converts sublethal experimental infections into lethal infection, accompanied by persistent viral replication in the target organ (brain) and suppression of anti-viral antibodies.

Aedes funereus was the most abundant mosquito species with 6,300-38,700 females per light trap night in the flying fox camp containing gray-headed, black (P. alecto), and little red (P. scapulatus) flying foxes. Sixteen Ae. funereus blood meals from this collection were analyzed by hemoglobin electrophoresis and were found to be from P. alecto. From pledget feeding with RR virus, the infectious dose required to infect 50% of wild caught Ae. funereus was log(10) 4.2 50% tissue culture infectious doses per mosquito, with a transmission rate to mice of 17% at 9-10 days post infection. Experimental infection of 10 juvenile P. poliocephalus produced viremias of low titer in five animals. with a duration of 1-4 days and a mean of two days. Three percent of colonized Ae. vigilax that fed on the 10 animals during this period became infected. One of the five viremic flying foxes and two of the five aviremic animals produced a detectable immune response by either neutralization or hemagglutination-inhibition tests. Based on the low to moderate vector competence of Ae. funereus for RR virus, and evidence that P. poliocephalus is a poor vertebrate host of RR virus, it is unlikely that RR virus transmission would be maintained between these two species, but it could be maintained by other more competent vector/host pairs.

The role that animal hosts play in disease transmission is still understudied and researchers wish to find suitable animal models for fundamental research and drug discovery. In this systematic review, we aimed to compile and discuss all articles that describe experimental or natural infections with SARS-CoV-2, from the initial discovery of the virus in December 2019 through to October 2020. We systematically searched four databases (Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct and Web of Science). The following data were extracted from the included studies: type of infection (natural or experimental), age, sample numbers, dose, route of inoculation, viral replication, detection method, clinical symptoms and transmission. Fifty-four studies were included, of which 34 were conducted on animal reservoirs (naturally or experimentally infected), and 20 involved models for testing vaccines and therapeutics. Our search revealed that Rousettus aegyptiacus (fruit bats), pangolins, felines, mink, ferrets and rabbits were all susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, while dogs were weakly susceptible and pigs, poultry, and tree shrews were not. In addition, virus replication in mice, mink, hamsters and ferrets resembled subclinical human infection, so these animals might serve as useful models for future studies to evaluate vaccines or antiviral agents and to study host-pathogen interactions. Our review comprehensively summarized current evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in animals and their usefulness as models for studying vaccines and antiviral drugs. Our findings may direct future studies for vaccine development, antiviral drugs and therapeutic agents to manage SARS-CoV-2-caused diseases.																					WOS:000590103000001	33206434

JOUR EXP MED				54	(2)			233	248		10.1084/jem.54.2.233				1931	1931	The clinical picture and gross pathology of spontaneous and experimental "mad itch" are described. The spontaneous disease was observed in cattle. It was rapidly fatal and the cardinal symptom was pruritus. The inciting agent was shown to be a filterable virus. Fatal infections were regularly produced in rabbits when the virus was administered subcutaneously, intracerebrally, intravenously, intratesticularly, intraperitoneally, intra-nasally, or when it was dropped on a scarified area of skin. The rabbit, guinea pig, white rat, white mouse, gray field mouse, cow, cat, duck, chicken, and hog were susceptible to experimental infection. The disease was not contagious. Localization of the virus in the animal body was limited largely to site of inoculation and to the lung. It could be preserved for long periods in a dried state or in 50% glycerol. Virucidal serum capable of completely neutralizing the virus was prepared. The tentative conclusion is that the "mad itch" virus is identical with that of pseudorabies in Europe, although it possesses certain minor demonstrable differences from the European strain. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R.

The formation of symplasts was noticed in the infected cultures: cytoplasmic bodies of B type were found out in the cells. With experimental infection, the virus was pathogenic to rabbits, Macaca rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, mice and suckling rats. The development of necroses with hemorrhages in the center was observed while infecting chick embryos in the chorional-lantoie membrane. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19674800102453	4973454

Despite these findings, the metabolic cost of APR upon viral challenge has not yet been studied in bats. Therefore, we evaluated the energy cost of APR in Artibeus lituratus upon challenge with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Poly(I:C)), a synthetic analog of double-stranded RNA that induces APR in mammals. To do this, we compared the resting metabolic rates of bats before and after the Poly(I:C) challenge and evaluated skin temperature and body mass loss. Our results revealed that the innate immune response elicited by Poly(I:C) involves a resting metabolic rate increase of 20%, equivalent to 0.28 Kj/h, associated with a body temperature increase of 1.2 degrees C. In principle, this increase is approximately three times lower than that previously reported in bat species challenged with a bacterial molecular pattern and represents 0.25% of the daily energy expenditure calculated for A. lituratus. The reasons underlying the differing APR energy costs induced by bacterial and viral molecular patterns as well as whether this energy investment, which is trivial in appearance, impacts the daily energy expenditure of A. lituratus remain to be determined.

Immunocytochemical procedures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification were used to detect viral antigen or viral RNA in 13 of 41 cell lines. The results of these procedures correlated exactly. Cell lines derived from cattle, sheep, goat, deer, bison, rabbit, and domestic cat were found contaminated with BVDV. Attempts were made to experimentally infect 14 swine, rabbit, hamster, cat, dog, monkey, and human cell lines that had been found free of virus. All swine cell lines, and most rabbit and cat cell lines, became infected with BVDV. Hamster, human, dog, and certain rabbit and cat cells were refractory to BVDV infection. Experimental infection of monkey cells produced variable results.																					WOS:A1994PA01100009	7989438

J	KANTOROVICH, R. A.								The etiology of hydrophobia in animals of trans-polar regions A report. I. The biological properties of virus								VOPR VIRUSOL				1956	(2)			32	37						1956	1956	A study is made of 2 strains of virus isolated in foxes suffering from hydrophobia, These strains induced symptoms in experimental laboratory animals (mice, rabbits, guinea pigs, pack rats) that are characteristic of disorders of the central nervous system: tremors of the body, impairment of coordination, paresis of the extremities and convulsions, followed by death. Filtration of the material revealed pathogenic activity and confirmed the viral nature of the strains. The strains showed considerable resistance to storage in 50% glycerine (pathogenic capacity remained unaffected after storage for 2 to 4 months), and 1% phenol (pathogenic properties preserved for 1 to 2 months). Pathogenic properties were rapidly lost upon irradiation of a viral suspension with UV rays, and the virus is rapidly inactivated by heating at 55 to 60[degree]C. In its clinical symptoms in natural and experimental infection, as well as its reaction to the effect of weak solutions of phenol, the strains studied are similar to the causative agents of rabies. Sensitivity to high temperatures distinguish them from the virus of demyelinizing encephalomyletis. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Transl. from Referat. Zhur.

Antibody Responses to Marburg Virus in Egyptian Rousette Bats and Their Role in Protection against Infection								VIRUSES-BASEL				10	2					73	10.3390/v10020073				FEB 2018	2018	Egyptian rousette bats (ERBs) are reservoir hosts for the Marburg virus (MARV). The immune dynamics and responses to MARV infection in ERBs are poorly understood, and limited information exists on the role of antibodies in protection of ERBs against MARV infection. Here, we determine the duration of maternal immunity to MARV in juvenile ERBs, and evaluate the duration of the antibody response to MARV in bats naturally or experimentally infected with the virus. We further explore whether antibodies in previously naturally exposed bats is fully protective against experimental reinfection with MARV. Maternal immunity was lost in juvenile ERBs by 5 months of age. Antibodies to MARV remained detectable in 67% of experimentally infected bats approximately 4 months post inoculation (p.i.), while antibodies to MARV remained present in 84% of naturally exposed bats at least 11 months after capture. Reinfection of seropositive ERBs with MARV produced an anamnestic response from day 5 p.i. Although PCR-defined viremia was present in 73.3% of reinfected ERBs, replicating virus was recovered from the serum of only one bat on day 3 p.i. The negative PCR results in the salivary glands, intestines, bladders and reproductive tracts of reinfected bats, and the apparent absence of MARV in the majority of swabs collected from these bats suggest that reinfection may only play a minor role in the transmission and maintenance of MARV amongst ERBs in nature.

Murine Model for the Study of Influenza D Virus								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				94	4					e01662-19	10.1128/JVI.01662-19				FEB 2020	2020	A novel genus within the Orthomyxoviridae family was identified in the United States and named influenza D virus (IDV). Bovines have been proposed to be the primary host, and three main viral lineages (D/OK-like, D/660-like, and D/Japanlike) have been described. Experimental infections had previously been performed in swine, ferrets, calves, and guinea pigs in order to study IDV pathogenesis. We developed a murine experimental model to facilitate the study of IDV pathogenesis and the immune response. DBA/2 mice were inoculated with 10(5) 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of D/bovine/France/5920/2014 (D/OK-like). No clinical signs or weight loss were observed. Viral replication was observed mainly in the upper respiratory tract (nasal turbinates) but also in the lower respiratory tract of infected mice, with a peak at 4 days postinfection. Moreover, the virus was also detected in the intestines. All infected mice seroconverted by 14 days postinfection. Transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that IDV induced the activation of proinflammatory genes, such as gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) and CCL2. Inoculation of NF-kappa B-luciferase and Ifnar1(-/-) mice demonstrated that IDV induced mild inflammation and that a type I interferon response was not necessary in IDV clearance. Adaptation of IDV by serial passages in mice was not sufficient to induce disease or increased pathogenesis. Taken together, present data and comparisons with the calf model show that our mouse model allows for the study of IDV replication and fitness (before selected viruses may be inoculated on calves) and also of the immune response.IMPORTANCE Influenza D virus (IDV), a new genus of Orthomyxoviridae family, presents a large host range and a worldwide circulation. The pathogenicity of this virus has been studied in the calf model. The mouse model is frequently used to enable a first assessment of a pathogen's fitness, replication, and pathogenesis for influenza A and B viruses. We showed that DBA/2 mice are a relevant in vivo model for the study of IDV replication. This model will allow for rapid IDV fitness and replication evaluation and will enable phenotypic comparisons between isolated viruses. It will also allow for a better understanding of the immune response induced after IDV infection.																					WOS:000510867500014	31776281

Pathobiology of rabies virus and the European bat lyssaviruses in experimentally infected mice								VIRUS RESEARCH				172	1-2			46	53		10.1016/j.virusres.2012.12.011				MAR 2013	2013	A comparison of the clinicopathology of European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) types-1 and -2 and of rabies virus was undertaken. Following inoculation of mice at a peripheral site with these viruses, clinical signs of rabies and distribution of virus antigen in the mouse brain were examined. The appearance of clinical signs of disease varied both within and across the different virus species, with variation in incubation periods and weight loss throughout disease progression. The distribution of viral antigen throughout the regions of the brain examined was similar for each of the isolates during the different stages of disease progression, suggesting that antigen distribution was not associated with clinical presentation. However, specific regions of the brain including the cerebellum, caudal medulla, hypothalamus and thalamus, showed notable differences in the proportion of virus antigen positive cells present in comparison to other brain regions suggesting that these areas are important in disease development irrespective of virus species.

Here, we describe rational antigen design through to manufacturability and vaccine efficacy of a prefusion-stabilised spike (S) protein, Sclamp, in combination with the licensed adjuvant MF59 'MF59C.1' (Seqirus, Parkville, Australia).Methods A panel recombinant Sclamp proteins were produced in Chinese hamster ovary and screened in vitro to select a lead vaccine candidate. The structure of this antigen was determined by cryo-electron microscopy and assessed in mouse immunogenicity studies, hamster challenge studies and safety and toxicology studies in rat.Results In mice, the Sclamp vaccine elicits high levels of neutralising antibodies, as well as broadly reactive and polyfunctional S-specific CD4(+) and cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells in vivo. In the Syrian hamster challenge model (n = 70), vaccination results in reduced viral load within the lung, protection from pulmonary disease and decreased viral shedding in daily throat swabs which correlated strongly with the neutralising antibody level.Conclusion The SARS-CoV-2 Sclamp vaccine candidate is compatible with large-scale commercial manufacture, stable at 2-8 degrees C. When formulated with MF59 adjuvant, it elicits neutralising antibodies and T-cell responses and provides protection in animal challenge models.																					WOS:000648333400007	33841880	
J	Breshears, MA; Black, DH; Ritchey, JW; Eberle, R								Construction and in vivo detection of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing strain of Saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1)								ARCHIVES OF VIROLOGY				148	2			311	327		10.1007/s00705-002-0914-3				FEB 2003	2003	Saimiriine herpesvirus 1 (SaHV-1) is an alpha-herpesvirus of squirrel monkeys used in mice to study neural pathogenesis of herpesviruses. To trace dissemination of virus from a peripheral site of inoculation to the central nervous system tissues, a recombinant strain of SaHV-1 expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) was constructed by site-specific insertion of a GFP expression cassette into a transcriptionally null point in the SaHV-1 genome. PCR and Southern blot confirmed insertion of a single GFP expression cassette into the target site of the SaHV-1 genome. The recombinant virus was shown to produce strong fluorescence in the cytoplasm of infected cells in vitro. Growth kinetic experiments demonstrated no differences between recombinant and wild type SaHV-1 in producing infectious progeny virions. The recombinant virus was comparable to wild type SaHV-1 in development of clinical disease, microscopic lesions and induction of an antibody response in mice following intramuscular inoculation. Using confocal microscopy, GFP expression was easily observed in formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues of mice infected with the recombinant SaHV-1. This simple specimen processing technique preserves tissue morphology and allows detection, of viral replication within various tissues of experimentally infected animals.

These include CoVs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and severe acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease. These observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs. In this review, we follow the CoV outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats. We review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor CoVs without severe disease. We speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and factors that enable these viruses to jump from bats to other mammals. We hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations.

But while so far all bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been identified in fruit bats across Africa, Australia, South America, and Asia, we describe the detection and characterization of the first paramyxoviruses in free-ranging European bats. Moreover, we examined the possible impact of paramyxovirus infection on individual animals by comparing histo-pathological findings and virological results. Organs from deceased insectivorous bats of various species were sampled in Germany and tested for paramyxovirus RNA in parallel to a histo-pathological examination. Nucleic acids of three novel paramyxoviruses were detected, two viruses in phylogenetic relationship to the recently proposed genus Jeilongvirus and one closely related to the genus Rubulavirus. Two infected animals revealed subclinical pathological changes within their kidneys, suggestive of a similar pathogenesis as the one described in fruit bats experimentally infected with Hendra virus. Our findings indicate the presence of bat-born paramyxoviruses in geographic areas free of fruit bat species and therefore emphasize a possible virus-host co-evolution in European bats. Since these novel viruses are related to the very distinct genera Rubulavirus and Jeilongvirus, a similarly broad genetic diversity among paramyxoviruses in other Microchiroptera compared to Megachiroptera can be assumed. Given that the infected bats were either found in close proximity to heavily populated human habitation or areas of intensive agricultural use, a potential risk of the emergence of zoonotic paramyxoviruses in Europe needs to be considered.

The transmission of Puumala virus (PUUV) in colonized bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) was investigated and additional longevity studies in cell culture with PUUV and Tula (TULV) hantaviruses were performed. Wild-type PUUV excreted by experimentally infected donor bank voles was shown to be transmitted indirectly between rodents through contaminated beddings, and maintained its infectivity to recipient voles at room temperature for 12-15 days. In cell culture supernatants, PUUV and TULV remained infectious for 5-11 days at room temperature and up to 18 days at 4 degrees C, but were inactivated after 24 h at 37 degrees C. Interestingly, a fraction of dried virus was still infectious after 1 h at 56 degrees C. These results demonstrated that hantavirus transmission does not require direct contact between rodents, or between rodents and humans, and that the indirect transmission of PUUV through contaminated environment takes place among the rodents for a prolonged period of time. The results also have implications for safety recommendations for work with hantaviruses and for preventive measures.																					WOS:000239612500002	16847107

Groups of 3-week-old mice were inoculated intracerebrally with a 101 dilution of each virus, with and without DMSO. Batches were killed every 3 hours, commencing in the canine virus groups 24 hours after inoculations in the bovine virus groups after 72 hours, and in the vampire virus groups after 96 hours. Brain impressions were examined for fluorescent antibodies. Remaining mice were kept to determine the time of appearance of clinical signs. The time of appearance of fluorescence was variable, and some impressions in each series were negative. In the canine virus group it was first noted at 24 hours, and the first signs appeared 90-96 hours later; the average period of incubation in the DMSO series was about one day shorter than in the virus-only series, but fluorescence was not increased. In the bovine virus series fluorescence appeared at 81 hours and clinical signs 87 hours later, DMSO reduced the period of incubation by one day. In the vampire virus series fluorescence was noted at 96 hours and the average period of incubation was 14 days in the DMSO and 15 days in the virus-only group.

Experimentally infected mice exhibit different clinical signs and lethality depending on a combination of LCMV epitope peptides and host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. This study examined the pathogenicity, clinical signs and lethality, of two new LCMV strains (BRC and OQ28) using three inbred mouse strains with different genetic backgrounds having different H-2D haplotypes. Strain OQ28 (OQ28) infected mice exhibited clinical signs and lethality, whereas strain BRC (BRC) infected mice showed no clinical signs of infection. The viral genome load in tissues of C57BL/6 mice infected with two strains was determined using one-step real time RT-PCR. In C57BL/6 mice, higher levels of OQ28 viral genome load were detected in all tissues rather than were present in BRC infected mice. The viral genome load in lungs of both virus strains remained higher levels than in other tissues at 28 days post infection. Comparing sequences of the three LCMV epitope peptide regions revealed one non-conservative amino acid substitution codon in OQ28 and two amino acid differences in BRC. These results suggest that the varied pathogenicity and viral genome load of LCMV strains are not based only on differences in the host MHC class I molecule.

To develop tools for the study of the ANDV-host interactions, we used RNA-Seq to generate a de novo transcriptome assembly. Splenic RNA from five rice rats captured in Chile, three of which were ANDV-infected, was used to generate an assembly of 66,173 annotated transcripts, including noncoding RNAs. Phylogenetic analysis of selected predicted proteins showed similarities to those of the North American deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), the principal reservoir of Sin Nombre virus (SNV). One of the infected rice rats had about 50-fold more viral burden than the others, suggesting acute infection, whereas the remaining two had levels consistent with persistence. Differential expression analysis revealed distinct signatures among the infected rodents. The differences could be due to 1) variations in viral load, 2) dimorphic or reproductive differences in splenic homing of immune cells, or 3) factors of unknown etiology. In the two persistently infected rice rats, suppression of the JAK-STAT pathway at Stat5b and Ccnot1, elevation of Casp1, RIG-I pathway factors Ppp1cc and Mff, and increased FC receptor-like transcripts occurred. Caspase-1 and Stat5b activation pathways have been shown to stimulate T helper follicular cell (TFH) development in other species. These data are also consistent with reports suggestive of TFH stimulation in deer mice experimentally infected with hantaviruses. In the remaining acutely infected rice rat, the apoptotic pathway marker Cox6a1 was elevated, and putative anti-viral factors Abcb1a, Fam46c, Spp1, Rxra, Rxrb, Trmp2 and Trim58 were modulated. Transcripts for preproenkephalin (Prenk) were reduced, which may be predictive of an increased T cell activation threshold. Taken together, this transcriptome dataset will permit rigorous examination of rice rat-ANDV interactions and may lead to better understanding of virus ecology.

Caspase-1 and Stat5b activation pathways have been shown to stimulate T helper follicular cell (TFH) development in other species. These data are also consistent with reports suggestive of TFH stimulation in deer mice experimentally infected with hantaviruses. In the remaining acutely infected rice rat, the apoptotic pathway marker Cox6a1 was elevated, and putative anti-viral factors Abcb1a, Fam46c, Spp1, Rxra, Rxrb, Trmp2 and Trim58 were modulated. Transcripts for preproenkephalin (Prenk) were reduced, which may be predictive of an increased T cell activation threshold. Taken together, this transcriptome dataset will permit rigorous examination of rice rat-ANDV interactions and may lead to better understanding of virus ecology.

Our goal was to compare focal and systemic immune responses with those induced following immunization with the protein adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide (F/ALOH) adjuvant or by experimental infection. Sera from mice vaccinated with the QS-21 formulation (F/QS-21) contained elevated anti-F protein IgG antibody titres that were dependent on the dose of QS-21 employed. Similar to the immune responses generated by experimental infection, the sera from mice vaccinated with F/QS-21 possessed greater capacity to neutralize virus infectivity that was associated with the generation of heightened complement-fixing IgG2a antibody titres. In contrast, vaccination with F/ALOH elicited systemic immune responses that were characterized by a predominance of protein-specific antibodies of the IgG1 subclass and lower neutralizing antibody titres. The capacity of F/QS-21 to facilitate local pulmonary immune responses was also examined and found to be similar to those induced by experimental infection. After virus challenge, a 90-fold increase in the number of F protein-specific antibody-secreting cells was observed and associated with the clearance of virus from the infected lungs. Moreover, elevated levels of antigen-dependent killer cell activity were detected and appeared to be mediated by class I major histocompatibility complex restricted CD8+ T cells. Additional characterization of the pulmonary immune response was performed on the cellular infiltrates obtained after bronchoalveolar lavage and on formalin-fixed lung tissue. The local protective immune responses induced after challenge of the groups immunized with F/QS-21 Or infectious virus were significantly different from those elicited in naive control mice injected with adjuvant alone, or in mice immunized with F/ALOH. The cellularity of the lavage fluids from the former groups was characterized by a significantly greater percentage of lymphocytes and less neutrophils. In similar fashion histological evaluation of the lungs from mice immunized with F/QS-21 or infectious virus revealed significantly elevated local immune responses after challenge. In conclusion, the results suggest that formulation with F/QS-21 alters the qualitative and quantitative nature of the immune response to the F glycoprotein when compared with the traditional aluminium-based adjuvants.

Preliminary evidence of age-dependent clinical signs associated with porcine circovirus 2b in experimentally infected CH3/Rockefeller mice								RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE				103				70	72		10.1016/j.rvsc.2015.09.008				DEC 2015	2015	Mice and rats are susceptible to porcine circovirus 2b (PCV2) infection under field and experimental conditions. However, whether PCV2 induces disease in rodents remains a matter of debate. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether PCV2-induced disease in mice is age-dependent and whether intranasally inoculated animals are able to infect animals they come into contact with. Twenty-five CH3/Rockefeller mice were divided into six groups and intranasally inoculated with 25 mu L of either PCV2b or PBS on days 0, 3 and 6. One group remained untreated. Two age groups were tested: 3-week-old mice and 6-week-old mice. The administration of three PCV2 intranasal inoculations at intervals of three days was able to induce infection and support virus transmission in susceptible mice, regardless of the age at inoculation. The clinical signs associated with PCV2 infection were more severe in younger mice, and PCV2-DNA load was higher in their faeces. In conclusion, PCV2 induced disease in mice.

Experimental infections with West Nile virus								CURRENT OPINION IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES				20	3			293	297		10.1097/QCO.0b013e32816b5cad				JUN 2007	2007	Purpose of review West Nile virus emerged recently in North America as a serious human and animal pathogen. This review summarizes the use of experimental infections with West Nile virus in diverse vertebrate species that have been used to answer fundamental questions about the host response, pathogenesis of West Nile virus infection and virus evolution.Recent findings West Nile virus has an extremely broad vertebrate host range. Infection of common species of birds has defined those with high vs. low potential to serve as amplifying hosts for the virus. In general, mammals (primates, horses, companion animals) are dead-end hosts for West Nile virus, although some circumstances (i.e. immunosuppression) may allow individuals to become capable of transmitting the virus to mosquitoes. Some mammals (rodents, rabbits, squirrels) and reptiles (alligators) have been found to develop a viremia of sufficient magnitude to predict at least low competence for infecting feeding mosquitoes. Finally, experimental infection of rodents, horses and primates with West Nile virus has been integral to developing and evaluating the efficacy of West Nile virus vaccines.Summary Experimental infection with West Nile virus has assisted in delineating those hosts important and not important to the transmission cycle, in understanding how the virus induces disease in susceptible hosts, and in validating the efficacy of vaccines used for control of disease.

It is mainly transmitted by the bite of an infected tick and circulates among them and their vertebrate hosts. Until now, TBE risk analysis in Germany has been based on the incidence of human cases. Because of an increasing vaccination rate, this approach might be misleading, especially in regions of low virus circulation.Method: To test the suitability of rodents as a surrogate marker for virus spread, laboratory-bred Microtus arvalis voles were experimentally infected with TBEV and analyzed over a period of 100 days by real-time (RT)-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Further, the prevalence of TBEV in rodents trapped in Brandenburg, a rural federal state in northeastern Germany with autochthonous TBE cases, was determined and compared with that in rodents from German TBE risk areas as well as TBE nonrisk areas.Results: In experimentally infected M. arvalis voles, TBEV was detectable in different organs for at least 3 months and in blood for 1 month. Ten percent of all rodents investigated were positive for TBEV. However, in TBE risk areas, the infection rate was higher compared with that of areas with only single human cases or of nonrisk areas. TBEV was detected in six rodent species: Apodemus agrarius, Apodemus flavicollis, Apodemus sylvaticus, Microtus agrestis, Microtus arvalis, and Myodes glareolus. M. glareolus showed a high infection rate in all areas investigated.Discussion and Conclusion: The infection experiments proved that TBEV can be reliably detected in infected M. arvalis voles. These voles developed a persistent TBE infection without clinical symptoms. Further, the study showed that rodents, especially M. glareolus, are promising sentinels particularly in areas of low TBEV circulation.																					WOS:000291717500009	21548766

In this study, primer sets specific for either H-1 or KRV were designed on the basis of DNA sequence comparisons of the rodent parvoviruses. The specificities of the H-1- and KRV-specific primer sets were determined by testing viral preparations of seven different parvoviruses and nine other viruses known to infect rodents. The H-1-specific PCR assay amplified the expected 254 bp product only in the presence of H-1 viral DNA and was able to detect as little as 100 fg of H-1 viral DNA. The KRV-specific PCR assay generated the expected 281-bp produce only when KRV viral DNA was used as the template and was able to detect as little as 10 pg of KRV viral DNA. Each assay was able to detect its respective virus in tissues from rats experimentally infected with H-1 or KRV. In contrast, no product was amplified by either assay with tissues from mock-infected rats. Our findings indicate that these PCR assays provide rapid, specific, and sensitive methods for the detection of H-1 or KRV infection in rats and cell culture systems.

Egyptian rousette bats maintain long-term protective immunity against Marburg virus infection despite diminished antibody levels								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				7						8763	10.1038/s41598-017-07824-2				AUG 18 2017	2017	Although bats are natural reservoir hosts for numerous zoonotic viruses, little is known about the long-term dynamics of the host immune response following infection and how these viruses are maintained in nature. The Egyptian rousette bat (ERB) is a known reservoir host for Marburg virus (MARV). Following infection of ERBs with MARV, virus-specific IgG antibodies are induced but rapidly wane and by 3 months post-infection the bats are seronegative. To determine whether reinfection of ERBs plays a role in MARV maintenance, we challenge groups of ERBs that were "naturally" or experimentally infected with MARV 17-24 months prior. No bats in either group exhibit evidence of MARV replication or shedding and all bats develop virus-specific secondary immune responses. This study demonstrates that infection of ERBs with MARV induces long-term protective immunity against reinfection and indicates that other factors, such as host population dynamics, drive MARV maintenance in nature.

Characterization of Monkeypox virus infection in African rope squirrels (Funisciurus sp.)								PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES				11	8					e0005809	10.1371/journal.pntd.0005809				AUG 2017	2017	Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa and is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the most virulent Orthopoxvirus affecting humans since the eradication of Variola virus (VARV). Many aspects of the MPXV transmission cycle, including the natural host of the virus, remain unknown. African rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) are considered potential reservoirs of MPXV, as serosurveillance data in Central Africa has confirmed the circulation of the virus in these rodent species [1,2]. In order to understand the tissue tropism and clinical signs associated with infection with MPXV in these species, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication and shedding via in vivo bioluminescent imaging, viral culture and real time PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Interestingly, one sentinel animal, housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study indicates that MPXV causes significant pathology in African rope squirrels and infected rope squirrels shed large quantities of virus, supporting their role as a potential source of MPXV transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions.

Current biology : CB				32	7			R307	R308		10.1016/j.cub.2022.02.057				2022-Apr-11	2022	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an enveloped non-segmented negative sense RNA virus that belongs to Orthopneumovirus genus of the Pneumoviridae family in the order Mononegavirales. The virus is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease in children under two years of age and is responsible for substantial disease burden in infants and elder people in both developed and developing countries1,2. RSV is only known to circulate among humans, though it was first isolated from chimpanzees3. The virus can experimentally infect mice, rats, cotton rats, ferrets, and hamsters, but does not naturally circulate in these animal populations4. We found that Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) were naturally infected with RSVs that have 99.4-99.8% genomic identity with strains circulating in humans. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that five RSVs in pangolins were RSV-A ON1 and seven were RSV-B BA genotypes, both of which are currently prevalent in humans worldwide. These findings suggest that humans might transmit their viruses to endangered wildlife.																					MEDLINE:35413253	35413253

The organism is also found as a saprophyte in the lungs of many species of animals. Animal models have been used as a source of P. carinii organisms for study of the disease. The rat model has been especially useful. Initially, the infection was latent in most colonies, and P. carinii pneumonia readily developed when animals were immunosuppressed. Today, many barrier raised rodent colonies are free of adventitious viruses, bacteria, Mycoplasma sp., and parasites, including P. carinii. Variability is now seen in the rat model. The use of cultured organisms to experimentally infect rats and mice prior to immunosuppression has met the need for some investigators, however, latent-infected, barrier-raised and isolator-raised rodents are still required. Colonies specifically infectead with P. carinii can provide latent-infected animals and are better protected from potentially interfering organisms than barrier-raised animals. The development of these colonies is feasible as investigators and animal producers work together to define and develop this resource.																					WOS:A1991HA63000078	1818135

Serological evidence and experimental infection of cynomolgus macaques with pteropine orthorevirus reveal monkeys as potential hosts for transmission to humans								EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS				8	1			787	795		10.1080/22221751.2019.1621668				MAY 28 2019	2019	Pteropine orthoreoviruses (PRV) are emerging bat-borne viruses with proven zoonotic transmission. We recently demonstrated human exposure to PRV in Singapore, which together with previous reports from Malaysia and Vietnam suggest that human infection of PRV may occur periodically in the region. This raises the question whether bats are the only sources of human infection. In this study, we screened 517 cynomolgus macaques caught in Singapore for evidence of exposure to PRV3M (also known as Melaka virus), which was first isolated from human patients in Melaka, Malaysia. We found that 67 serum samples were PRV3M positive by ELISA and 34 were also positive by virus neutralization assay. To investigate whether monkeys could act as hosts for PRV transmission, we experimentally infected cynomolgus macaques with PRV3M and housed these animals with uninfected monkeys. Although no clinical signs of infection were observed in infected animals, viral RNA was detected in nasal and rectal swabs and all infected macaques seroconverted. Additionally, one of the uninfected animals seroconverted, implying active shedding and transmission of PRV3M. We provide evidence that PRV exposure in the macaque population in Singapore occurs at a relatively high prevalence and this study suggests that cynomolgus macaques may be an intermediate or reservoir host for PRVs.

We infected colonized bank voles subcutaneously to study and compare the infection kinetics, acute infection, and potential viral persistence of the three known TBEV subtypes: European (TBEV-Eur), Siberian (TBEV-Sib) and Far Eastern (TBEV-FE). All strains representing the three subtypes were infective and highly neurotropic. They induced (meningo) encephalitis in some of the animals, however most of the cases did not present with apparent clinical symptoms. TBEV-RNA was cleared significantly slower from the brain as compared to other organs studied. Supporting our earlier findings in natural rodent populations, TBEV-RNA could be detected in the brain for up to 168 days post infection, but we could not demonstrate infectivity by cell culture isolation. Throughout all time points post infection, RNA of the TBEV-FE was detected significantly more often than RNA of the other two strains in all organs studied. TBEV-FE also induced prolonged viremia, indicating distinctive kinetics in rodents in comparison to the other two subtypes. This study shows that bank voles can develop a neuroinvasive TBEV infection with persistence of viral RNA in brain, and mount an anti-TBEV IgG response. The findings also provide further evidence that bank voles can serve as sentinels for TBEV endemicity.																					WOS:000328734200006	24349041

They also harbor many other viruses that are thought to have caused disease in humans after spillover into intermediate hosts, including SARS and MERS coronaviruses. As is usual with reservoir hosts, these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats. Despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents, virtually nothing is known about the host/virus relationships; principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections, a lack of reagents, methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology, and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work. These challenges can be addressed, in part, with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses, which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature, and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock.

This island is also habitat for an endangered native rodent, the short-tailed mouse (Leggadina lakedownensis). Concerns have been raised that house mice may pose a threat to L. lakedownensis both through competition and as a source of infection. To assess the threat to L. lakedownensis posed by viral pathogens from M. domesticus, a serological survey was conducted from 1994 to 1996 of both species for evidence of infection with 14 common murine viruses (mouse hepatitis virus, murine cytomegalovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, ectromelia virus, mouse adenovirus strains FL and K87, minute virus of mice, mouse parvovirus, reovirus type 3, Sendai virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus, polyoma virus, pneumonia virus of mice, and encephalomyocarditis virus) and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Despite previous evidence that populations of free-living M, domesticus from various locations on the Australian mainland were infected with up to eight viruses, M. domesticus on Thevenard Island were seropositive only to murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV). Antibodies to MCMV were detected in this species at all times of sampling, although seroprevalence varied. Infectious MCMV could be isolated in culture of salivary gland homogenates from seropositive mice. In contrast, L. lakedownensis on Thevenard Island showed no serological evidence of infection with MCMV, any of the other murine viruses, or M. pulmonis, and no virus could be isolated in culture from salivary gland homogenates. Although MCMV replicated to high titers in experimentally infected inbred BALB/c laboratory mice as expected, it did not replicate in the target organs of experimentally inoculated L. lakedownensis, indicating that the strict host specificity of MCMV may prevent its infection of L. lakedownensis. These results suggest that native mice on Thevenard Island are not at risk of MCMV infection from introduced house mice, and raise interesting questions about the possible selective survival of MCMV in small isolated populations of M, domesticus.

Transmission to 2 calves, rabbits, white mice, white rats and guineapigs did not produce any symptoms. Antibodies in the sera of the 2 artificially infected calves, rabbits, and of 4 calves from the 2 herds where the virus originated were absent or in very low titres.

Thus, in mouse models, a great barrier exists for analysis of infections with human-tropic viruses. Mouse models are unlikely to faithfully reproduce the human immune response to viruses or viral compounds and it is difficult to evaluate human therapeutic efficacy with antiviral reagents in mouse models. Humans and mice essentially have different immune systems, which makes it difficult to extrapolate mouse results to humans. In addition, apart from immunological reasons, viruses causing human diseases do not always infect mice because of species tropism. One way to determine tropism would be a virus receptor that is expressed on affected cells. The development of gene-disrupted mice and Tg mice, which express human receptor genes, enables us to analyze several viral infections in mice. Mice are, indeed, susceptible to human viruses when artificially infected in receptor-supplemented mice. Although the mouse cells less efficiently permit viral replication than do human cells, the models for analysis of human viruses have been established in vivo as well as in vitro, and explain viral pathogenesis in the mouse systems. In most systems, however, nucleic acid sensors and type I interferon suppress viral propagation to block the appearance of infectious manifestation. We herein review recent insight into in vivo antiviral responses induced in mouse infection models for typical human viruses.																					WOS:000398852400001	28370181

Experimental infection of laboratory animals with the Nagano strain of the goat pneumonia virus								JAPANESE JOUR EXPTL MED				26	(1/2)			37	55						1956	1956	Some observations were made on experimental infection of laboratory animals with the goat pneumonia virus, a member of the psittacosis -lymphogranuloma group of viruses. The virus has relatively high pathogenicity in guinea pigs and readily infects guinea pigs by intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intra-tracheal, subcutaneous, intravenous, or peroral routes of inoculation. Particularly intraperitoneal inoculation is highly effective and induces death of the animal even with a very small dose of virus. Intracerebral inoculation produces rapid death of guinea pigs, usually within 48 hours, with a relatively large dose of virus. In contrast this virus shows low pathogenicity in mice. Lung consolidation is observed by intranasal instillation with a heavy dose, but infection is rarely fatal to the animal. In developing chicken eggs, the virus readily multiplied in various tissues when inoculated into the yolk sac and the highest titer is obtained in the yolk sac and yolk. Pulmonary lesions are produced in a young monkey by intratracheal inoculation. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. concl																					BCI:BCI19573100021893

Susceptibility of some African wild rodents to infection with various arthropod-borne viruses								TRANS ROY SOC TROP MED AND HYG				55	(1)			63	68		10.1016/0035-9203(61)90041-4				1961	1961	Nine species of African wild rodents were tested for their susceptibility to 11 arthropod-borne viruses. Wesselsbron, Spondweni and Pongola viruses failed to develop in species of white-tailed rats (Mystromys), multimammate mice (Mastomys), pouched mice (Saccostomus), the African rat (Aethomys) and the High Velde gerbil (Tatera). In addition the Wesselsbron virus did not develop in the Vlei rat (Otomys) and Spondweni and Pongola viruses failed to develop in the single-striped mouse (Lemniscomys). Only Aethomys species would support the growth of the West Nile virus. Mystromys, Arvicanthus (East African field rat), Mastomys, Otomys and Rhabdomys (Cape striped field mouse) did not support the development of the West Nile virus. Only Mystromys of all of those types tested developed a viremia when inoculated with Bunyamwera virus. Chikungunga, Simbu, Middleburg, Rift Valley, H 336, and Germiston viruses were all capable of producing viremias of various degrees of intensity in one or more of the rodent species tested. In all of such cases, the viremias were quite transitory yet were strong enough to cause antibody development. In spite of failure to find any naturally occurring cases of wild rodents carrying these viruses, the fact that they can be experimentally infected and transmit such infection makes it necessary, to view the presence of rodents as potentially dangerous. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A.

LBC rat mammary adenocarcinoma cells were susceptible only if the cells were treated with diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D). A recent report that RCVs grow well in L2 mouse fibroblast cells was confirmed and expanded. RCV infection of L2 cells was substantially enhanced by treatment of cells with trypsin but not by treatment with DEAE-D. Primary isolation of SDAV from experimentally infected rats was accomplished using trypsin-treated L2 cells. One of 13 additional cell lines tested (rat urinary bladder epithelium, RBL-02) supported growth of RCVs, and growth was slightly enhanced by DEAE-D, but not by trypsin. These refinements of in vitro growth conditions for RCVs should facilitate further studies of their basic biology and improve options for primary isolation.

J	Wang, Lin-Fa								Bat viruses and diseases								MICROBIOLOGY AUSTRALIA				30	4			122	126						SEP 2009	2009	Bats, representing approximately 20% of mammal species, are the most abundant, diverse and geographically dispersed vertebrates on earth. Bats of various species have recently been identified as the reservoir hosts of many emerging viruses responsible for severe human and livestock disease outbreaks. These include Hendra and Nipah viruses, SARS coronavirus, Ebola viruses, Melaka virus and others. Australian scientists played a vital role in the discovery and/or characterisation of many of these emerging bat viruses. While these viruses result in significant morbidity and mortality in other mammals, they appear to cause no clinical consequence in bats under natural or experimental infection. Understanding this key difference in pathogenesis and the mechanism of virus spillover from bats to other mammals will be critical for our effort to prevent and control future disease outbreaks caused by bat-borne zoonotic viruses.

Notes et Reflexions sur le Toxoplasme et la Toxoplasmose du Gondi (Toxoplasma gundii, Nicolle et Manceaux, 1909).				Arch. Inst. Pasteur				10	1-2			1	40						1917, October	1917	The gundi [Ctenodactylus gundi] is the mammal in which toxoplas-mosis has been most frequently and most regularly found, the disease occurring regularly in the season October to March. The virus has never been found in the animal in natural conditions, the disease appearing only after at least 17 days' captivity, though there is no proof that it is contracted at the Institute at Tunis. The natural ectoparasites of the gundi are the ticks, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Latr., abundant in the nymphal stage, and Hyalomma sp., occasionally found in the nymphal stage; a mite, Trombidium sp., abundant in the larval stage; a flea, Coenopsylla mira, Rothsch., peculiar to the gundi and rarely found. Two biting flies, the Chironomid, Thersestes (Mycterotypus) laurae, Weiss, and the Simuliid, Simulium lineatum, and probably other nocturnal flies that bite man and other mammals in the neighbourhood of water also attack the gundi. Of these parasites, only Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Trombidium sp. seem possible carriers of toxoplasmosis in nature, though neither these nor the other parasites mentioned breed on the gundi in captivity. As possible vectors in the laboratory, R. sanguineus, of canine origin, Dermanyssus sp. from birds, Ctenocephalus canis[Ctenocephalides canis] (serraticeps) (dog-flea) and Cimex lectularius (bed-bug) should be considered. Two dogs, living in a kennel adjoining the gundi cage, apparently contracted toxoplasmosis, one in 1910 and one in 1917. The gundi is apparently the most susceptible animal to its own virus, intraperitoneal inoculation, which alone has been tried, proving fatal. After the gundi, the mouse is the moot susceptible species, many other small rodents falling into this category. The white rat is resistant; rabbits and dogs can be infected only by intravenous inoculation; the cat is more susceptible than the dog; the receptivity of the pigeon is inconstant.A bibliography of 48 works is given.

Currently, there is no treatment available, except post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) that can be administered whenever exposure to a rabid animal took place. Here we describe the beneficial effects of a combination treatment initiated at day 4 post infection, containing anti-viral drugs and immune modulators in infected mice. Combination therapy resulted in significant increase in survival time (P < 0.05) and significantly lowers viral RNA in the brain and spinal cord (P < 0.05). Furthermore, treatment influenced markers of pyroptosis and apoptosis and early inflammatory response as measured by the levels of TNF-alpha. Morphological lesions were absent in rabies virus infected mice with few signs of inflammation. However, these were not significant between the different groups. (C) 2018 The Authors.

Figshare															2017-09-14	2017	Monkeypox (MPX) is a zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa and is caused by Monkeypox virus (MPXV), the most virulent Orthopoxvirus affecting humans since the eradication of Variola virus (VARV). Many aspects of the MPXV transmission cycle, including the natural host of the virus, remain unknown. African rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.) are considered potential reservoirs of MPXV, as serosurveillance data in Central Africa has confirmed the circulation of the virus in these rodent species [1,2]. In order to understand the tissue tropism and clinical signs associated with infection with MPXV in these species, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication and shedding via in vivo bioluminescent imaging, viral culture and real time PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Interestingly, one sentinel animal, housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study indicates that MPXV causes significant pathology in African rope squirrels and infected rope squirrels shed large quantities of virus, supporting their role as a potential source of MPXV transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions.

The main purpose of this work was to determine the correlation between known molecular determinants of virulence in different avian influenza virus (AIV) genes and the results of experimental infection of birds and mammals with AIV strain A/swan/Mangistau/3/06 (H5N1; SW/3/06).Methods and results: We examined the virulence of SW/3/06 in four species of birds (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese) and five species of mammals (mice, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, pigs), and identified the molecular determinants of virulence in 11 genes (HA, NA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2, PA, NS1, NS2, M1, M2 and NP). SW/3/06 does not possess the prime virulence determinant of HPAIV - a polybasic HA cleavage site - and is highly pathogenic in chickens. SW/3/06 replicated efficiently in chickens, ducks, turkeys, mice and dogs, causing 100% mortality within 1.6-5.2 days. In addition, no mortalities were observed in geese, guinea pigs, cats and pigs. The HI assay demonstrated all not diseased animals infected with the SW/3/06 virus had undergone seroconversion by 14, 21 and 28 dpi. Eleven mutations in the seven genes were present in SW/3/06. These mutations may play a role in the pathogenicity of this strain in chickens, ducks, turkeys, mice and dogs. Together or separately, mutations 228S-103S-318I in HA may play a role in the efficient replication of SW/3/06 in mammals (mice, dogs, pigs).Conclusions: This study provides new information on the pathogenicity of the newly-isolated swan derived H5N1 virus in birds and mammals, and explored the role of molecular determinants of virulence in different genes; such studies may help to identify key virulence or adaptation markers that can be used for global surveillance of viruses threatening to emerge into the human population.

During acute infection, 39.5% of newborn Syrian hamsters developed severe growth interruption and weight loss, spleen atrophy, severe lymphocyte depletion, and massive viral antigen loads in the spleen. The lymph nodes and thymuses were observed in all diseased hamsters. Ecotropic Friend MuLV was rescued from the sera and spleen and heart extracts of the diseased hamsters, and the same disease was confirmed by induction of erythroleukemia in BALB/c mice. Our results demonstrate that an ecotropic MuLV after extended passage in vivo to infect hamster cells that are resistant to infection by wild type MuLV, causing pathologic lesions and a wasting syndrome in newborn hamsters in vivo. This may occur with variants of Friend MuLV that have lower infectivity in hamster cells and are not cleared by the immune system of newborn hamsters. These findings suggest the potential danger of the interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of heterologous retroviruses in humans. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo.Principle findingNiclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-kappa B (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication. Co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partially decreased viral replication, viral encephalitis, and mortality in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice.SignificanceThese results demonstrate that niclosamide diminishes viral infection by hindering endosomal acidification.

Because MusPV may have been missed during routine pathogen screening of mice in colonies worldwide, a variety of detection methods are described to detect MusPV. The clinical and histologic lesions of productive MusPV infections fit PV-associated features, including papillomas, koilocytes within the stratum granulosum of the hyperplastic/acanthotic papillomatous epithelium, and the presence of intranuclear virus particles in koilocytotic cells visualized by electron microscopy. Antiserum against disrupted PV virions, isolated from another species (canine), identified conserved viral antigens in productively infected cells by immunohistochemistry. A rolling circle technique was used to amplify viral circular DNAs followed by endonuclease restriction enzyme digestion to determine the correct size of PV DNA. Consensus PV degenerative primers. My09/11, commonly used to detect many different types of PVs by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), particularly mucosotropic HPVs, also identified MusPV and all rodent PVs tested. Since there was one nucleotide mismatch between the My09/11 primer set and the MusPV template, a new primer set, MusPV-My09/11, was designed to specifically detect MusPV in latent infections and spontaneous MusPV-induced papillomas. Southern blot analysis verified the presence of full size PV DNA in infected tissues. Virus-like particles (VLPs), generated from MusPV L1 genes, provided a substrate for serological testing of naturally and experimentally infected mice. In summary, a series of diagnostic assays were developed and validated to detect MusPV infection in skin tumors and serological response in laboratory mice. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular and structural changes related to hepatitis E virus antigen and its expression in testis inducing apoptosis in Mongolian gerbil model								JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS				24	8			696	707		10.1111/jvh.12690				AUG 2017	2017	Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been associated with a wide range of extrahepatic manifestations, so this study was designed to examine the effect and role of HEV on structural and molecular changes in the testicular tissues of Mongolian gerbils experimentally infected with swine HEV. HEV RNA was first detected in testis at 14 days post--inoculation and reached a peak between 28 and 42 days later with viral load between 3.12 and 6.23 logs/g by PCR assays. Changes including vacuolation, sloughing of germ cells, formation of multinuclear giant cells, degeneration, necrosis of tubules and damaged blood--testis barrier were observed through transmission electron microscopy. HEV ORF2 antigen was detected in the sperm cell cytoplasm along with decrease in relative protein of zonula occludens--1 through immunohistochemistry. HEV ORF3 antigen and ZO--1 protein were detectable by Western blotting. Lower (P<.05) serum testosterone and higher (P<.05) blood urea nitrogen level was observed in inoculated Mongolian gerbils. Likewise, increased (P<.05) germ cell apoptosis rate was detected with significant increased expression of Fas-L and Fas in HEV-inoculated groups at each time points. Up-regulation (P<.05 or P<.01) in mRNA level of Fas-L, Fas, Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 was observed in HEV RNA-positive testes. Our study demonstrated that after experimental inoculation, HEV can be detected in testis tissues and viral proteins produce structural and molecular changes that in turn disrupt the blood--testis barrier and induce germ cell apoptosis.

The latent virus can reactivate to cause recurrent infection. Both primary and recurrent infections can induce diseases, such as encephalitis. In humans, the majority of encephalitis cases occur as a recurrent infection. However, in the past, numerous mouse studies documented that viral reactivation occurs efficiently in the ganglion, but extremely rarely in the brain, when assessed ex vivo by cultivating minced tissue explants. Here, we compare the brains and the trigeminal ganglia of mice latently infected with HSV-1 (strain 294.1 or McKrae) for levels of viral genomes and in vivo reactivation. The numbers of copies of 294.1 and McKrae genomes in the brain stem were significantly greater than those in the trigeminal ganglion. Most importantly, 294.1 and McKrae reactivation was detected in the brain stems earlier than in the trigeminal ganglia of mice treated with hyperthermia to reactivate latent virus in vivo. In addition, the brain stem yielded reactivated virus at a high frequency compared with the trigeminal ganglion, especially in mice latently infected with 294.1 after hyperthermia treatment. These results provide evidence that recurrent brain infection can be induced by the reactivation of latent virus in the brain in situ.IMPORTANCEHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) establishes latency in neurons of the brains and sensory ganglia of humans and experimentally infected mice. The latent virus can reactivate to cause recurrent infection. In the past, studies of viral reactivation focused on the ganglion, because efficient viral reactivation was detected in the ganglion but not in the brain when assessed ex vivo by cultivating mouse tissue explants. In this study, we report that the brain contains more viral genomes than the trigeminal ganglion in latently infected mice. Notably, the brain yields reactivated virus early and efficiently compared with the trigeminal ganglion after mice are stimulated to reactivate latent virus. Our findings raise the potential importance of HSV-1 latent infection and reactivation in the brain.																					WOS:000341872700023	25031345

Experimental infection, by intracerebral, i/v, i/p and s/c routes, of hamadryas, baboons, green monkeys, rabbits, g.pigs, white mice, and hamsters failed, as did inoculation of various cell cultures. The disease was set up only in macaque monkeys. In both spontaneous and experimental infections, the presence of the virus was detected in blood, urine and nasopharyngeal washings, but not in faeces. Since this virus is distinguishable in its properties from other viruses of haemorrhagic fever type, its study is of great interest.																					CABI:19672201273

The survival of infected hosts, viral replication in lungs and brains, and histopathologic changes in the two mouse strains were compared. In both strains of mice, mortality occurred during the period 7 to 10 days postinfection. However, dm2 mice were relatively resistant to lethal infections. Viral replication occurred at low levels in the lungs of both strains and did not evoke significant pathologic changes. In contrast, viral replication in the brains was much greater; in the BALB/c strain, this was accompained by more frequent and more severe pathologic changes. In general, mice surviving at day 10 had effectively cleared virus from central nervous system but not respiratory sites. Evidence is presented that viral replication occurs first in the nasal cavity and is transmitted both to the lungs and to the olfactory bulb where focal cytopathology occurs. Virus enters the ventricles, causing encephalitis; necrosis occurs around the ventricles and in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord. Necrotic lesions were accompanied by mononuclear infiltration. Mice immunized with virus of the same serotype or with a vaccinia virus hybrid encoding the VSV glycoprotein were protected from lethal infection; in contrast, mice immunized with heterotypic virus were susceptible to challenge.

In order to assess their reservoir potential, wild-caught rope squirrels were experimentally infected via intranasal and intradermal exposure with a recombinant MPXV strain from Central Africa engineered to express the luciferase gene. After infection, we monitored viral replication via in vivo bioluminescent imaging and viral shedding via culture and PCR. MPXV infection in African rope squirrels caused mortality and moderate to severe morbidity, with clinical signs including pox lesions in the skin, eyes, mouth and nose, dyspnea, and profuse nasal discharge. Both intranasal and intradermal exposures induced high levels of viremia, fast systemic spread, and long periods of viral shedding. Shedding and luminescence peaked at day 6 post infection and was still detectable after 15 days. Evidence of viral persistence in tissues by real-time PCR was observed in animals that survived infection. Interestingly, one sentinel animal, housed in the same room but in a separate cage, also developed severe MPX disease and was euthanized. This study highlights the epidemiological importance of African rope squirrels and suggests the potential role of this rodent species as a natural reservoir host of MPXV and a source of direct transmission to humans and other animals in endemic MPX regions.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				36	5			363	366						2014	2014	Bats are important natural reservoir hosts for a number of new and emerging zoonotic viruses. Currently the isolation of bat viruses has to be conducted mainly on cell lines derived from terrestrial mammals rather than bats and only limited bat viruses have been isolated. To increase the isolation efficiency of bat viruses an immortalized bat cell lines was established in the present study by transduction with SV40 large T antigen (LT) gene. First of all, primary fetal kidney cells of bat Myotis petax were prepared by trypsinization of the kidney tissue. Then SV40 LT gene was transduced into the primary kidney cells by retrovirus system. Positively transduced cells were selected by puromycin, followed by continuous passage. The expression of SV40 LT gene was detected by RT-PCR and western blot. Finally three immortalized cell lines were established by cloning of transduced cells at passage 33 with one of them, named Mp-Ki03, being cultured for 60 passages. This cell line is unable to form cell clumps in soft agarose indicating that it was not transformed cells. Experimental infection of Mp-Ki03 cells with previously isolated bat reovirus and rotavirus showed that Mp-Ki03 cells are susceptible to these viruses at primary passage. These results indicated that an immortalized bat fetal kidney cell line has been established and showed desirable sensitivity to bat viruses, indicating the potential use of this cellline for bat virus isolation and identification.

Despite shared vulnerability to infection with advancing age in humans and rodents, the relatively long time required for immune senescence to take hold practically restricts the use of naturally aged mice to investigate aging-induced immunological shifts. Here, we show accelerated aging Lmna(Dhe) mice with spontaneous mutation in the nuclear scaffolding protein, lamin A, replicate infection susceptibility, and substantial immune cell shifts that occur with advancing age. Naturally aged (>= 20 month) and 2- to 3-monthold Lmna(Dhe) mice share near identically increased influenza A susceptibility compared with age-matched Lmna(WT) control mice. Increased mortality and higher viral burden after influenza infection in Lmna(Dhe) mice parallel reduced accumulation of lung alveolar macrophage cells, systemic expansion of immune suppressive Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells, and skewed immune dominance among viral-specific CD8(+) T cells similar to the immunological phenotype of naturally aged mice. Thus, aginginduced infection susceptibility and immune senescence are replicated in accelerated aging Lmna(Dhe) mice.																					WOS:000367661200021	26248606

The epidemiology of Borna disease virus (BDV), as for other members of the family Bornaviridae, is largely unknown, although evidence exists for a reservoir in small mammals, for example bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In addition to the current exogenous infections and despite the fact that bornaviruses have an RNA genome, bornavirus sequences integrated into the genomes of several vertebrates millions of years ago. Our hypothesis is that the bank vole, a common wild rodent species in traditional BDV-endemic areas, can serve as a viral host; we therefore explored whether this species can be infected with BDV, and if so, how the virus spreads and whether viral RNA is transcribed into DNA in vivo. We infected neonate bank voles intracerebrally with BDV and euthanized them 2 to 8 weeks post-infection. Specific Ig antibodies were detectable in 41%. Histological evaluation revealed no significant pathological alterations, but BDV RNA and antigen were detectable in all infected brains. Immunohistology demonstrated centrifugal spread throughout the nervous tissue, because viral antigen was widespread in peripheral nerves and ganglia, including the mediastinum, esophagus, and urinary bladder. This was associated with viral shedding in feces, of which 54% were BDV RNA-positive, and urine at 17%. BDV nucleocapsid gene DNA occurred in 66% of the infected voles, and, surprisingly, occasionally also phosphoprotein DNA. Thus, intracerebral BDV infection of bank vole led to systemic infection of the nervous tissue and viral excretion, as well as frequent reverse transcription of the BDV genome, enabling genomic integration. This first experimental bornavirus infection in wild mammals confirms the recent findings regarding bornavirus DNA, and suggests that bank voles are capable of bornavirus transmission.

In this study, a cytolytic virus was isolated from Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells from fecal samples of bovine with severe diarrhea and hemorrhagic intestinal mucosa that had been originally diagnosed with bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) by a bovine viral diarrhea virus Ag point-of-care test (IDEXX, American). Random priming PCR was used to amplify underlying viral sequences and identify the isolated virus. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the isolated virus closely matches the EV-E2 species, which is different from other Chinese strains previously isolated. The newly identified virus was named HLJ-3531/2013. We infected the sulking mice with the isolated virus. Reverse-transcription PCR, hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, serum neutralization (SN) test, and virus isolation from various tissues revealed that HLJ-3531/2013 can infect the intestine, liver, and lung of suckling mice. The present work is the first to report the reproduction of clinical symptoms by an isolated virus in an experimental infection model of animals and lays a solid foundation for the development of the pathogenesis of bovine enteroviruses.

Hamster Polyomavirus Research: Past, Present, and Future								VIRUSES-BASEL				13	5					907	10.3390/v13050907				MAY 2021	2021	Hamster polyomavirus (Mesocricetus auratus polyomavirus 1, HaPyV) was discovered as one of the first rodent polyomaviruses at the end of the 1960s in a colony of Syrian hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus) affected by skin tumors. Natural HaPyV infections have been recorded in Syrian hamster colonies due to the occurrence of skin tumors and lymphomas. HaPyV infections of Syrian hamsters represent an important and pioneering tumor model. Experimental infections of Syrian hamsters of different colonies are still serving as model systems (e.g., mesothelioma). The observed phylogenetic relationship of HaPyV to murine polyomaviruses within the genus Alphapolyomavirus, and the exclusive detection of other cricetid polyomaviruses, i.e., common vole (Microtus arvalis polyomavirus 1) and bank vole (Myodes glareolus polyomavirus 1) polyomaviruses, in the genus Betapolyomavirus, must be considered with caution, as knowledge of rodent-associated polyomaviruses is still limited. The genome of HaPyV shows the typical organization of polyomaviruses with an early and a late transcriptional region. The early region encodes three tumor (T) antigens including a middle T antigen; the late region encodes three capsid proteins. The major capsid protein VP1 of HaPyV was established as a carrier for the generation of autologous, chimeric, and mosaic virus-like particles (VLPs) with a broad range of applications, e.g., for the production of epitope-specific antibodies. Autologous VLPs have been applied for entry and maturation studies of dendritic cells. The generation of chimeric and mosaic VLPs indicated the high flexibility of the VP1 carrier protein for the insertion of foreign sequences. The generation of pseudotype VLPs of original VP1 and VP2-foreign protein fusion can further enhance the applicability of this system. Future investigations should evaluate the evolutionary origin of HaPyV, monitor its occurrence in wildlife and Syrian hamster breeding, and prove its value for the generation of potential vaccine candidates and as a gene therapy vehicle.

In this ELISA system, LCMV-nucleoprotein (NP) expressed by recombinant baculovirus and purified with high molar urea was used as the antigen. Sera from laboratory animals experimentally infected with the Armstrong strain or the newly isolated M1 strain of LCMV were examined to detect anti-LCMV antibody by the ELISA system, and the reactivity was compared with that of IFA test. Regardless of LCMV strain, all the sera of adult mice infected with LCMV were positive with very high optical density (OD). Also, the sera from mice neonatally infected with LCMV M1 strain were positive with slightly lower OD than adult mice. In contrast, all the sera of uninfected mice were negative to LCMV-NP antigen. Similarly, anti-LCMV antibodies were detected in all the sera of hamsters, mastomyses, and gerbils infected with the LCMV Armstrong strain. The results of the ELISA were in complete agreement with those of IFA, and indicate the high sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA system in the detection of anti-LCMV antibody. Because this ELISA system does not require handling infectious LCMV in the course of the antigen preparation and serological assay, there is no risk of contamination in the laboratory or nearby animal facility. In addition, by using negative control antigen in parallel with positive antigen in ELISA, we can exactly check the LCMV contamination in laboratory animals.

J	MALAGA-ALBA, AURELIO								Vampire bat as a carrier of rabies								AMER JOUR PUBL HEALTH				44	(7)			909	918						1954	1954	Vampire bats have been known to exist since the early discovery of America and for the past 45 years they have been known to transmit paralytic rabies to livestock. The range of the vampire bat, D. rotundus, given name extends from Argentina and Chile (parallel 30[degree], latitude S) to Potan, Sinaloa (parallel 28[degree], latitude N). Rabies in vampire bats may (1) manifest itself in the classical furious or paralytic type common to all mammals, (2) resemble rabies in birds or, (3) develop a characteristic asymptomatic carrier state. This has been observed in nature and has been reproduced in experimentally infected bats. The rabies virus by repeated passages through the bat has modified its pathogenicity, developing a species specificity. The virus is of low virulence but of high invasiveness; it shows greater pathogenicity for cattle and other domestic animals. Dog and man are decidedly less susceptible to this strain. While in the enzootic areas of 15 countries of this continent animals are killed annually by the thousands, vampire bats rabies in man has only been reported in Trinidad and Mexico. The high susceptibility of man and dog has considerable epidemiological importance, because, although the public health hazard is not so great, it does not minimize the possible danger of the bat as a rabies carrier. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ. and concl																					BCI:BCI19552900011843

However, little is known about the viral diversity harbored by rodents in China. Here we performed viral metagenomic analyses of 314 wild rodents covering 7 species, sampled in North-western China. We also conducted a systematic virological characterization of a new Wenzhou virus (WENV) isolate, QARn1, from a brown rat (Rattus norvegicus). Full genomic and phylogenetic analyses showed that QARn1 is a previously unidentified strain of Wenzhou mammarenavirus and forms a new branch within the Asian Glade. Experimental infection of Sprague-Dawley rats with QARn1 did not present overt pathology, but specific humoral immune responses developed and mild hemorrhage and immunocyte infiltration of the lungs and thymus were observed. These observations have expanded the geographic distribution of WENV to Central Asia, and further confirm that brown rats are natural hosts of Wenzhou virus.

We infected colonized bank voles subcutaneously to study and compare the infection kinetics, acute infection, and potential viral persistence of the three known TBEV subtypes: European (TBEV-Eur), Siberian (TBEV-Sib) and Far Eastern (TBEV-FE). All strains representing the three subtypes were infective and highly neurotropic. They induced (meningo)encephalitis in some of the animals, however most of the cases did not present with apparent clinical symptoms. TBEV-RNA was cleared significantly slower from the brain as compared to other organs studied. Supporting our earlier findings in natural rodent populations, TBEV-RNA could be detected in the brain for up to 168 days post infection, but we could not demonstrate infectivity by cell culture isolation. Throughout all time points post infection, RNA of the TBEV-FE was detected significantly more often than RNA of the other two strains in all organs studied. TBEV-FE also induced prolonged viremia, indicating distinctive kinetics in rodents in comparison to the other two subtypes. This study shows that bank voles can develop a neuroinvasive TBEV infection with persistence of viral RNA in brain, and mount an anti-TBEV IgG response. The findings also provide further evidence that bank voles can serve as sentinels for TBEV endemicity.																					DRCI:DATA2015151006023783

Extreme Susceptibility of African Naked Mole Rats (Heterocephalus glaber) to Experimental Infection with Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				59	1			83	90						FEB 2009	2009	Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) is widely used as a gene delivery vector in a variety of laboratory animals. In a recent study, a thymidine-kinase-inactive (replication-conditional) HSV1 used as a delivery vector was lethal in naked mole rats, whereas mice infected with the identical virus showed no adverse effects. This result prompted us to undertake a controlled comparative histologic study of the effect of HSV1 infection on naked mole rats and mice. Replication-competent and replication-conditional HSV1 caused widespread inflammation and necrosis in multiple organ systems of naked mole rats but not mice; naked mole rats infected with replication-defective virus showed no adverse effects. We conclude that the lethality of HSV1 for naked mole rats is likely the result of overwhelming infection, possibly in part due to this species' natural lack of proinflammatory neuropeptides at the initial site of infection.

A count was taken of wild carnivores in the Ukrainian USSR and their dynamics, distribution, migration, feeding, reproduction, biocenotic and synanthropic relations were studied. Data were analyzed for the experimental infection of foxes, raccoon dogs, hedgehogs, syrian hamster, common vole, rabbits and white mice. The ecological features of predatory mammals and their biocenotic relations play a large role in the origination and formation of natural rabies foci. Among the factors responsible for the circulation of the virus in nature are the wide distribution of foxes, its wide eurytopicity, some behavior factors and mode of life. The formation of additional reservoirs of infection, attributed to raccoon dogs, is a factor which substantially widens the foci of rabies virus in the Ukrainian USSR.

Rodents had little or no serum antibody reactive with C, neoformans proteins prior to infection. The intensity and specificity of the rodent antibody response were dependent on the species, the mouse strain, and the viability of the inoculum, All humans had serum antibodies reactive with C. neoformans proteins regardless of the potential exposure, the HIV infection status, or the subsequent development of cryptococcosis. Our results indicate (i) a high prevalence of antibodies reactive with C. neoformans proteins in the sera of rodents after cryptococcal infection and in humans with or without HIV infection; (ii) qualitative and quantitative differences in the antibody profiles of HN-positive individuals; and (iii) similarities and differences between humans, mice, and rats with respect to the specificity of the antibodies reactive,vith C, neoformans proteins. The results are consistent with the view that C, neoformans infections are common in human populations, and the results have implications for the development of vaccination strategies against cryptococcosis.

Despite the presence of its reservoir, the bank vole, on most of French territory, the geographic distribution of NE cases is heterogeneous and NE endemic and non-endemic areas have been reported. In this study we analyzed whether bank vole-PUUV interactions could partly shape these epidemiological differences. We performed crossed-experimental infections using wild bank voles from French endemic (Ardennes) and non-endemic (Loiret) areas and two French PUUV strains isolated from these areas. The serological response and dynamics of PUUV infection were compared between the four cross-infection combinations. Due to logistical constraints, this study was based on a small number of animals. Based on this experimental design, we saw a stronger serological response and presence of PUUV in excretory organs (bladder) in bank voles infected with the PUUV endemic strain. Moreover, the within-host viral diversity in excretory organs seemed to be higher than in other non-excretory organs for the NE endemic cross-infection but not for the NE non-endemic cross-infection. Despite the small number of rodents included, our results showed that genetically different PUUV strains and in a lesser extent their interaction with sympatric bank voles, could affect virus replication and diversity. This could impact PUUV excretion/transmission between rodents and to humans and in turn at least partly shape NE epidemiology in France.																					WOS:000586960500001	32993044

Experimental infection of laboratory animals with the Nagano strain of goat pneumonia virus								BULL NATL INST ANIMAL HEALTH				32				71	91						1957	1957	Observations were made on experimental infection of laboratory animals with the goat pneumonia virus, a member of the psittacosis -lymphogranuloma group of viruses. The virus had relatively high pathogenicity in guinea pigs, infecting them readily by the intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intratracheal, subcutaneous, intravenous or oral route of inoculation. Particularly intraperitoneal inoculation brought pronounced fatal effect to the animal even with very small dose of virus. Intracerebral inoculation with a relatively large dose of virus produced rapid death in guinea pigs usually within 48 hours. On the contrary, this virus showed low pathogenicity in mice. Lung consolidation was observed by intranasal instillation with a heavy dose, but the infection was rarely fatal to the animal. In developing chick eggs, the virus readily multiplied in various tissues when inoculated into the yolk sac, the highest titer being obtained in the yolk sac and yolk. Pulmonary lesions were produced in a young monkey by intratracheal inoculation. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. concl																					BCI:BCI19603500013978		
J	Tabynov, K.; Sansyzbay, A.; Sandybayev, N.; Mambetaliyev, M.								The pathogenicity of swan derived H5N1 virus in birds and mammals and its gene analysis.								Virology Journal				11	207			(29 November 2014)	(29 November 2014)						2014	2014	Background: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses continue to circulate in poultry and can infect and cause mortality in birds and mammals; the genetic determinants of their increased virulence are largely unknown. The main purpose of this work was to determine the correlation between known molecular determinants of virulence in different avian influenza virus (AIV) genes and the results of experimental infection of birds and mammals with AIV strain A/swan/Mangistau/3/06 (H5N1; SW/3/06). Methods and results: We examined the virulence of SW/3/06 in four species of birds (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese) and five species of mammals (mice, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, pigs), and identified the molecular determinants of virulence in 11 genes (HA, NA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2, PA, NS1, NS2, M1, M2 and NP). SW/3/06 does not possess the prime virulence determinant of HPAIV - a polybasic HA cleavage site - and is highly pathogenic in chickens. SW/3/06 replicated efficiently in chickens, ducks, turkeys, mice and dogs, causing 100% mortality within 1.6-5.2 days. In addition, no mortalities were observed in geese, guinea pigs, cats and pigs. The HI assay demonstrated all not diseased animals infected with the SW/3/06 virus had undergone seroconversion by 14, 21 and 28 dpi. Eleven mutations in the seven genes were present in SW/3/06. These mutations may play a role in the pathogenicity of this strain in chickens, ducks, turkeys, mice and dogs. Together or separately, mutations 228S-103S-318I in HA may play a role in the efficient replication of SW/3/06 in mammals (mice, dogs, pigs). Conclusions: This study provides new information on the pathogenicity of the newly-isolated swan derived H5N1 virus in birds and mammals, and explored the role of molecular determinants of virulence in different genes; such studies may help to identify key virulence or adaptation markers that can be used for global surveillance of viruses threatening to emerge into the human population.

Investigating the zoonotic origin of the West African Ebola epidemic								EMBO MOLECULAR MEDICINE				7	1			17	23		10.15252/emmm.201404792				JAN 2015	2015	The severe Ebola virus disease epidemic occurring in West Africa stems from a single zoonotic transmission event to a 2-year-old boy in Meliandou, Guinea. We investigated the zoonotic origins of the epidemic using wildlife surveys, interviews, and molecular analyses of bat and environmental samples. We found no evidence for a concurrent outbreak in larger wildlife. Exposure to fruit bats is common in the region, but the index case may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of insectivorous free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus). Bats in this family have previously been discussed as potential sources for Ebola virus outbreaks, and experimental data have shown that this species can survive experimental infection. These analyses expand the range of possible Ebola virus sources to include insectivorous bats and reiterate the importance of broader sampling efforts for understanding Ebola virus ecology.

In 1995, two new members of the family Flaviviridae, named GBV-A and GBV-B, were identified in tamarins that developed hepatitis following inoculation with the 11th GB passage. Neither virus infects humans, and a number of GBV-A variants were identified in wild New World monkeys that were captured. Subsequently, a related human virus was identified [named GBV-C or hepatitis G virus (HGV)], and recently a more distantly related virus (named GBV-D) was discovered in bats. Only GBV-B, a second species within the genus Hepacivirus (type species hepatitis C virus), has been shown to cause hepatitis; it causes acute hepatitis in experimentally infected tamarins. The other GB viruses have however not been assigned to a genus within the family Flaviviridae. Based on phylogenetic relationships, genome organization and pathogenic features of the GB viruses, we propose to classify GBV-A-like viruses, GBV-C and GBV-D as members of a fourth genus in the family Flaviviridae, named Pegivirus (pe, persistent; g, GB or G). We also propose renaming 'GB' viruses within the tentative genus Pegivirus to reflect their host origin.																					WOS:000287638800001	21084497	
J	LEPINE, P.								Recherches sur le typhus exanthematique et sur son origine murine. I. Sur l'existence d'un typhus murin dans le bassin oriental de la M6di-terranee et sur les caracteres de ce virus								ANN INST PASTEUR [PARIS]				51	(3)			290	376						1933	1933	A virus, maintained by regular guinea-pig passage, was found with great frequency in the brains of rats in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean. The spontaneous disease of wild rats seems to have developed, during endemics, from a mild disease especially attacking the black rat. In vitro and in vivo, the Athens rat-borne, or murine, virus possessed characteristics analogous to those usually attributed to exanthematous typhus virus, and cerebral emulsions from animals receiving inoculations of these viruses had almost the same virulence. The murine virus was readily destroyed by heat, drying or antiseptics and maintained itself for only a short time in glycerine. On the other hand, it was resistant to cold and freezing. It passed through Chamberland L2 filters,but was held by Chamberland L3. Guinea pigs inoculated with this murine virus exhibited a febrile non-fatal infection, and, during the period of fever, a scrotal reaction analogous to that of Mexican typhus. An organism morphologically indistinguishable from Rickettsia prowazeki was observed in guinea pigs with scrotal reaction. The rat appears as the "animal reservoir" of mild typhus virus. The feverish and frequently fatal infection which rats contract following inoculation with mild typhus virus of murine origin differentiates it from epidemic typhus virus, which causes only mild infection in rats. However, by guinea-pig passage, murine virus can, without loss of virulence, lose these characteristics. Monkeys (Macaccus cynomolgus and Cercopithecus callithrix) react to murine virus with a febrile infection and develop a positive Weil-Felix reaction. The ground-squirrel (Citellus citellus) is susceptible to murine virus, but does not spontaneously contract, or act as natural reservoir of, endemic exanthematous typhus. Persistence of murine virus in the brains of ground squirrels for at least 31 days after experimental infection makes it possible to use this animal for laboratory conservation of mild typhus virus. Epidemic exanthematous typhus and murine viruses persist in the brain of rats after the characteristic period of fever. The murine virus is pathogenic for man, in whom the disease has the clinical characters of mild typhus (maladie de Brill). The virus in man presents the same characteristics as those observed in rats. Fleas and lice (Polylax spinulosum)found on rats infected with murine typhus are constantly infected. All fleas are susceptible, but Xenopsylla cheopis plays the most important role in transmission. Fleas put on infected rats for the first time become infected in 7-9 days. The virus multiplies rapidy in the flea without interfering with its vitality, and these fleas are then capable of transmitting the disease from rat to rat. Although the excreta of infected fleas are extremely virulent, the flea bite is probably not infectious. Infection of rats, and perhaps of man, is brought about by scratching the skin where the flea has bitten and deposited feces. Cross immunity tests showed that murine virus differs from the virus of "fievre bouton-neuse," but is closely related to epidemic exanthematous typhus virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: P.

A field strain of minute virus of mice (MVMm) exhibits age- and strain-specific pathogenesis								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				99	4			558	566		10.1099/jgv.0.001044				APR 2018	2018	The influence of mouse strain, immune competence and age on the pathogenesis of a field strain of minute virus of mice (MVMm) was examined in BALB/c, C3H, C57BL/6 and SCID mice experimentally infected as neonates, weanlings and adults. Sera, bodily excretions and tissues were harvested at 7, 14, 28 and 56 days after inoculation and evaluated by serology, quantitative PCR and histopathology. Seroconversion to recombinant viral capsid protein 2 was consistently observed in all immunocompetent strains of mice, regardless of the age at which they were inoculated, while seroconversion to the viral nonstructural protein 1 was only consistently detected in neonate inoculates. Viral DNA was detected by quantitative PCR in multiple tissues of immunocompetent mice at each time point after inoculation, with the highest levels being observed in neonate inoculates at 7 days after inoculation. In contrast, viral DNA levels in tissues and bodily excretions increased consistently over time in immunodeficient SCID mice, regardless of the age at which they were inoculated, with mortality being observed in neonatal inoculates between 28 and 56 days after inoculation. Overall, productive infection was observed more frequently in immunocompetent mice inoculated as neonates as compared to those inoculated as weanlings or adults, and immunodeficient SCID mice developed persistent, progressive infection, with mortality being observed in mice inoculated as neonates. Importantly, the clinical syndrome observed in experimentally infected SCID neonatal mice recapitulates the clinical presentation reported for the naturally infected immunodeficient NOD mu-chain knockout mice from which MVMm was initially isolated.

BDV has also been reported to be associated with neuropsychiatric diseases of humans by serologic study and by recovery of nucleic acid or virus from blood or brain. Natural infections of horses and sheep produce encephalitis with erratic excited behaviors, hyperkinetic movement or gait abnormalities; naturally infected cats have ataxic "staggering disease." Experimentally infected primates develop hyperactivity, aggression, disinhibition, then apathy; prosimians (lower primates) have hyperactivity, circadian disruption, abnormal social and dominance behaviors, and postural disorders. However, the neuropharmacological determinants of BD phenotypes in laboratory and natural hosts are incompletely understood. Here we review how experimentally infected rodents have provided models for examining behavioral, pharmacologic, and biochemical responses to viral challenge, and how rodents experimentally infected as neonates or as adolescents are providing models for examining age-specific neuropharmacological adaptations to viral injury.

By utilizing an antiporcine CD137 monoclonal antibody (mAb, clone 3B9) developed in our laboratory, we isolated virus-specific CD8 T cells from peripheral blood of pigs experimentally infected with different porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) strains. Similar to mouse, porcine CD8 T cells also express CD137 transiently upon Concavalin A stimulation while the unstimulated cells did not. Most frequently, virus-specific CD8 T cells were isolated at low levels from peripheral blood of pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV strains VR2385, NADC20, and MN184B at 49 and 63 days postinfection. The results suggest that porcine CD137-specific mAb is a useful tool for isolating virus-specific CD8 T cells from peripheral blood and tissues of pigs after in vitro stimulation with viral antigen.

Recent evidence has indicated the involvement of pathogens such as viruses as causative agents, and specifically identified the coxsackievirus B serogroup as the leading culprit(2,3). Not only has coxsackievirus B3 (CB3) been identified from patients with cardiovascular disease(4), but also infection of mice with CB3 strains can reproduce human clinical heart disease in rodents(5,6). Several mechanisms have been proposed in an attempt to distinguish between pathology mediated by direct viral destruction of cardiac muscle cells(7,8) or by the virus-induced immune response directed at infected myocytes(9-11) or at 'mimicked' epitopes shared between viral and cardiac antigens(12-14). To distinguish between these mechanisms, we infected a unique mouse that diminishes the extent of infection and spread of the virus, but allows complete immunity to the virus. Transgenic mice expressing interferon-gamma in their pancreatic beta cells failed to develop CB-3-induced myocarditis. This work challenges the idea of the function of the immune response and 'molecular mimicry' in the CB-3-induced autoimmune myocarditis model, and instead favors the idea of virus-mediated damage. These results emphasize the benefit of reducing the level of viremia early during infection, thereby reducing the incidence of virus-mediated heart damage and autoimmunity.

That is ensured by preparing a suspension of brain white mice experimentally infected with rabies virus. Brain tissue is homogenised in 0.1 M phosphate-buffer solution at pH 7.27.4. Obtained cerebral suspension is held in test tubes for at least 5 minutes until complete precipitation of silicon carbide balls. Supernatant is taken and 0.1 M phosphate-buffer solution is added to the test tubes, then shaken 3 times, held for at least 5 minutes and centrifuged for 50 minutes at 5,000 rpm. Supernatant is concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 37,000 rpm for 4 hours. Supernatant is then removed and the resulting resuspended residue is layered on a step gradient of 1060% sucrose. Ultracentrifugation for 3 hours at 30,000 rpm at temperature of +40C viral material is then fractionated by gel filtration. Immunoblot results are used to select active fractions, re-precipitate them with alcohol and obtain an antigen of rabies virus. USE - Medicine. ADVANTAGE - Invention increases specificity and sensitivity of the obtained antigen and increases output of the active antigen.1 cl, 1 tbl, 6 dwg																					DIIDW:201971424X

In previous studies, our group demonstrated the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection by dengue virus (DENV) 1 and 2, and the virus was successfully isolated in several organs. In this study, BALB/c mice were experimentally infected intravenously with DENV-4, and samples of their saliva were collected. Viral RNA extracted from the saliva samples was subjected to qRT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.002 PFU/mL. The presence of DENV-4 viral RNA was detected in the saliva of two mice, presenting viral titers of 109 RNA/mL. The detection of DENV RNA via saliva sampling is not a common practice in dengue diagnosis, due to the lower detection rates in human patients. However, the results observed in this study seem to indicate that, as in humans, detection rates of DENV RNA in mouse saliva are also low, correlating the infection in both cases. This study reports the first DENV detection in the saliva of BALB/c immunocompetent mice experimentally infected with non-neuroadapted DENV-4.																					WOS:000428692100003	29412340

The initial characterization of TCRV suggested that artibeus bats were natural reservoir hosts. However, nearly 60 years later experimental infections of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) resulted in fatal disease or clearance, suggesting artibeus bats may not be a reservoir host. To further evaluate the TCRV reservoir host status of artibeus bats, we captured bats of six species in Trinidad for evidence of infection. Bats of all four fruigivorous species captured had antibodies to TCRV nucleocapsid, whereas none of the insectivore or nectarivore species did. Many flat-faced fruit-eating bats (A. planirostris) and great fruit-eating bats (A. literatus) were seropositive by ELISA and western blot to TCRV nucleocapsid antigen, as were two of four Seba's fruit bats (Carollia perspicillata) and two of three yellow-shouldered fruit bats (Sturnira lilium). Serum neutralization tests failed to detect neutralizing antibodies to TCRV from these bats. TCRV RNA was not detected in lung tissues or lung homogenates inoculated onto Vero cells. These data indicate that TCRV or a similar arenavirus continues to circulate among fruit bats of Trinidad but there was no evidence of persistent infection, suggesting artibeus bats are not reservoir hosts.

H5N1 influenza viruses isolated from patients during the incident killed experimentally infected mice. The principal lesions of the mice were broncho-interstitial pneumonia and nonsuppurative encephalitis. Infectious viruses and/or viral antigens were detected in the brain as well as in the trigeminal and vagal ganglia but not in the blood of the mice. These findings suggest that the virus reached the brain through the vagus and/or trigeminal nerves following replication in the respiratory mucosa. The results imply that neurotropism of the H5N1 virus in mice is a novel characteristic in the pathogenesis of infection by human influenza virus isolates. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Filoviruses and bats								MICROBIOLOGY AUSTRALIA				38	1			12	16		10.1071/MA17005				MAR 2017	2017	While Reston and Lloviu viruses have never been associated with human disease, the other filoviruses cause outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever characterised by person-to-person transmission and high case fatality ratios. Cumulative evidence suggests that bats are the most likely reservoir hosts of the filoviruses. Ecological investigations following Marburg virus disease outbreaks associated with entry into caves inhabited by Rousettus aegyptiacus bats led to the identification of this bat species as the natural reservoir host of the marburgviruses. Experimental infection of R. aegyptiacus with Marburg virus has provided insight into the natural history of filovirus infection in bats that may help guide the search for the reservoir hosts of the ebolaviruses.

During 2009-2010, six strains of H3N2 influenza virus were isolated from dogs in Jiangsu Province, China. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis of eight gene segments revealed that the six viruses were most similar to a recent canine-derived subtype H3N2 influenza virus isolated in cats from South Korea, which originated from avian strain. By comparing the deduced amino acid sequences of the hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the six Jiangsu isolates against the most similar avian strains, we found that all isolates had several common mutations at the receptor-binding sites, potential glycosylation sites and cleavage site in HA], and antigenic sites in both the HA1 and NA segments. Significantly, a unique two amino acid insertion in the NA stalk was found. Experimental infection of BALB/c mice revealed that viral RNA could be detected in the major rodent organs, such as brain, heart, spleen, kidney, liver and intestine, as well as the lung. All the sampled organs from infected mice showed significant lesions and viral antigen staining. This study highlights the potential of domesticated animals to become a reservoir for influenza virus and the need for surveillance programs to detect cross-species transmission.

We successfully passaged a mouse-adapted strain of Sin Nombre virus from deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) by i.m. inoculation of 4- to 6-wk-old deer mouse pups. After inoculation with 5 ID50, antibodies to the nucleocapsid (N) antigen first became detectable at 14 d whereas neutralizing antibodies were detectable by 7 d. Viral N antigen first began to appear in heart, lung, liver, spleen, and/or kidney by 7 d, whereas viral RNA was present in those tissues as well as in thymus, salivary gland, intestine, white fat, and brown fat. By 14 d nearly all tissues examined displayed both viral RNA and N antigen. We noted no consistent histopathologic changes associated with infection, even when RNA load was high. Viral RNA titers peaked on 21 d in most tissues, then began to decline by 28 d, Infection persisted for at least 90 d, The RNA titers were highest in heart, lung, and brown fat. Deer mice can be experimentally infected with Sin Nombre virus, which now allows provocative examination of the virus-host relationship. The prominent involvement of heart, lung, and brown fat suggests that these sites may be important tissues for early virus replication or for maintenance of the virus in nature.

The pathogenicity of CPIV3 has been examined in goats but it has not been explored in other laboratory animals. In the present study, an experimental infection of guinea pigs with CPIV3 was performed. The virus-inoculated guinea pigs displayed clinical signs related to the respiratory disease at 2-12 days post inoculation (dpi). Five infected guinea pigs died during 2 and 7 dpi. Apparent gross pneumonic lesions including consolidation and congestion in one or more lung lobes were observed in necropsied and dead animals. Histo-pathological changes in lungs including expansions of the alveolar interstitium, congestion, macrophage infiltration and compensatory emphysema were also observed. Virus was detectable at 2-10 dpi, 2-10 dpi and 2-7 dpi, as detected by virus isolation, real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry staining, respectively. Viremia was also confirmed after CPIV3 infection during 3-7 dpi. The severe pathological lesions and highest viral load were observed before 7 dpi. Viral specific hemagglutination inhibition and neutralizing antibodies were produced from 7 dpi and 10 dpi, respectively, which related to the clearance of virus. The results present here indicated that guinea pig could be an ideal laboratory animal model for CPIV3 studies in the future.																					WOS:000483008700008	31163247

Experimental infection with virulent WNV strains in the mouse and hamster models frequently results in severe neural infection and moderate to high mortality, both of which are not representative features of most human and equine infections. We have established a rabbit model for investigating pathogenesis and immune response of non-lethal WNV infection. Two species of rabbits, New Zealand White (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and North American cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.), were experimentally infected with virulent WNV and Murray Valley encephalitis virus strains. Infected rabbits exhibited a consistently resistant phenotype, with evidence of low viremia, minimal-absent neural infection, mild-moderate neuropathology, and the lack of mortality, even though productive virus replication occurred in the draining lymph node. The kinetics of anti-WNV neutralizing antibody response was comparable to that commonly seen in infected horses and humans. This may be explained by the early IFN/ and/or response evident in the draining popliteal lymph node. Given this similarity to the human and equine disease, immunocompetent rabbits are, therefore, a valuable animal model for investigating various aspects of non-lethal WNV infections.

Enhanced efficacy of orally active cidofovir prodrugs against experimental cytomegalovirus infections.								Abstracts of the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy				43				501	501						2003	2003	Background: Cidofovir (CDV) is effective for treatment of severe Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infections but is not active when given orally. To improve the oral bioavailability of CDV, a series of alkoxyalkyl ester analogs were synthesized and two of these, hexadecyloxypropyl-CDV (HDP-CDV) and octadecyloxyethyl-CDV (ODE-CDV) had multiple log increases in activity against a variety of HCMV isolates as well as murine; rat, and guinea pig CMV strains. Methods: The effect of oral treatment with HDP-CDV or ODE-CDV was evaluated using murine CMV (MCMV) and HCMV infections in mice. Results: In BALB/c mice inoculated with MCMV, oral treatment with 2-5 mg/kg of HDP-CDV or ODE-CDV starting 24 or 48 h after infection provided significant protection against mortality, and reduced viral replication in lung, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, and salivary glands by gtoreq5 log10. In one HCMV model, human retinal tissue was implanted into SCID mouse eyes and infected 6 weeks later with 4400 pfu/eye. Treatment with vehicle, 5-10 mg/kg of HDP-CDV, ODE-CDV, or i.p. CDV was begun 24 h after infection and continued for 28 days. At the end of treatment, virus titers in the vehicle-treated group were 168 pfu/ml compared to 17 pfu/ml in the CDV-treated group, and 11 pfu/ml in the HDP-CDV group. In a second model, human thymus and liver tissue was implanted under the kidney capsule and infected 16 weeks later with 6600 pfu of HCMV/implant and animals were treated as above. At 28 days after infection, HCMV titers in the vehicle group were 4.7 log10 pfu/g compared with 3.2 log10 pfu/g in the CDV group. In contrast, no virus was detected in HDP-CDV-treated animals or with some dosages of ODE-CDV. Conclusions: These studies indicate that HDP-CDV and ODE-CDV are the most active compounds we have tested in experimental infections against MCMV and HCMV and are excellent candidates for evaluation in human CMV infections.					43rd Annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy43rd Annual Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy	September 14-17, 2003September 14-17, 2003	American Society for MicrobiologyAmerican Society for Microbiology	Chicago, IL, USAChicago, IL, USA													BCI:BCI200400015825

Borna Disease the illness ranges from asymptomatic to fatal meningoencephalitis across naturally infected warm blooded (mammalian and bird) species. There are also reported associations of the virus with neuropsychiatric diseases of man. Development of experimentally infected rodents, frequently rats, as models for examining behavioral, pharmacologic and biochemical responses to viral challenge at different stages of life have contributed to understanding the role of CNS viral injury in vulnerability to neurodevelopmental, behavioral and degenerative diseases.

Under natural conditions, HCV is able to infect only humans, and only chimpanzees are sensitive to experimental infection. In recent years, viruses genetically related to HCV were discovered in wild mammals (rodents, bats, rabbits), as well as in domestic animals living in close contact with humans (dogs, horses, cows). The Hepacivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae, previously represented only by HCV and, presumably, by GBV-B, now includes new related viruses of animals. The results of the study of molecular-genetic and biological properties of the hepaciviruses provide an opportunity to understand the history, evolution, and the origin of HCV. It also opens up the prospect of using HCV homologues of non-primates as a laboratory model for preclinical medical and prophylactic drugs against hepatitis C. It was found that the hepacivirus of horses is the most closely related to HCV among currently known HCV homologues.																					BCI:BCI201600733467

Inflammation was identified in the meninges, but not in the parenchyma of the brain of mice infected with either CVS-24 or SHBRV Necrosis was present in numerous cortical, hippocampal, and Purkinje neurons in CVS-24-infected mice, but only minimal necrosis was identified in mice infected with SHBRV Likewise, extensive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-digoxigenin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining was observed in the brain of mice infected with CVS-24 but little or none in the brain of mice infected with SHBRV Rabies virus antigens were distributed similarly in the CNS infected with either virus. However, the expression of the glycoprotein (G) is more widespread and the staining of G is generally stronger in CVS- than SHBRV-infected mice, whereas the expression of rabies virus nucleoprotein (N) is similar in mice infected with either CVS or SHBRV The positive TUNEL staining thus correlates with the high level of G expression in CVS-infected mouse brain. Northern blot hybridization revealed that the ratio between the N and G transcripts is similar in brains infected with either virus, indicating that the reduced expression of G protein is not caused by reduced transcription in SHBRV-infected animals. Taken together, these observations suggest that apoptosis is not an essential pathogenic mechanism for the outcome of a street rabies virus infection and that other pathologic processes may contribute to the profound neuronal dysfunction characteristic of street rabies.

This virus induced encephalitis in experimentally infected adult rats, but in newborn rats BDV established a persistent, tolerant infection with no apparent clinical signs. Here, we report evidence that newborn Mongolian gerbils (Meriones umguiculatus) are more susceptible to experimental intracranial inoculation of horse-derived BDV in persistently infected MDCK cells, compared with similar inoculation in newborn rats. All inoculated newborn gerbils, but not rats, died 30 days after infection. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplified BDV-specific sequences in several regions including the brain. Histopathological analysis revealed apparent inflammatory reactions in the brains of inoculated gerbils but not rats, although similar levels of BDV RNA were detected in both gerbil and rat brains. BDV-specific antigen and RNA were identified predominantly in neurons in the brains by immunohistochemistry with antibodies to BDV and in situ hybridization with BDV-specific riboprobes, respectively BDV in the gerbil brain was easily rescued by co-cultivation of the brain homogenate with human oligodendroglioma cells. Thus, gerbils seem to be a useful animal model for studying BDV-induced pathogenesis in the brain. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The guinea pig model was used to investigate the pathologic events in EBO infection that lead to death. Analytical methods included immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and electron microscopy. Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, primarily macrophages, were identified as the early and sustained targets of EBO virus. During later stages of infection, interstitial fibroblasts in various tissues were infected, and there was evidence of endothelial cell infection and fibrin deposition. The distribution of lesions, hematologic profiles, and increases in serum biochemical enzymes associated with EBO virus infection in guinea pigs was similar to reported findings in experimentally infected nonhuman primates and naturally infected humans.

Mosquitoes as vectors of the virus of equine encephalomyelitis								JOUR AMER VET MED ASSOC				35	(5)			767	771						1933	1933	Aedes aegypti transmitted the virus as early as 6 days after an infective meal, and remained infectious for at least 18 days and probably for life. Guinea pigs artificially infected had the virus in the circulating blood within 48 hrs., and it persisted in the blood during the febrile stage, disappearing from the circulation in the last stages, when the temp. dropped. Mosquitoes feeding on animals during the period in which the blood contained virus became infected. The disease was transmitted from guinea pigs to a horse by mosquitoes, and from the horse back to guinea pigs. While only A. aegypti was employed, other spp. of Aedes probably are equally capable of transmitting the disease. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R. A. Kelser																					BCI:BCI19340800003931

In previous studies, our group demonstrated the susceptibility of BALB/c mice to infection by dengue virus (DENV) 1 and 2, and the virus was successfully isolated in several organs. In this study, BALB/c mice were experimentally infected intravenously with DENV-4, and samples of their saliva were collected. Viral RNA extracted from the saliva samples was subjected to qRT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.002 PFU/mL. The presence of DENV-4 viral RNA was detected in the saliva of two mice, presenting viral titers of 109 RNA/mL. The detection of DENV RNA via saliva sampling is not a common practice in dengue diagnosis, due to the lower detection rates in human patients. However, the results observed in this study seem to indicate that, as in humans, detection rates of DENV RNA in mouse saliva are also low, correlating the infection in both cases. This study reports the first DENV detection in the saliva of BALB/c immunocompetent mice experimentally infected with non-neuroadapted DENV-4.

Journal of Medical Virology				70	Supplement 1			S79	S81		10.1002/jmv.10326				2003	2003	Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) results in a latent infection in humans after primary infection. Latency has also been established in guinea pigs and rats after inoculation with the virus. It was found that infection of cotton rats with the Oka vaccine strain of VZV results in a latent infection. To begin to identify which genes are required for latency, we infected cotton rats with VZV strain Oka that is deleted for ORF61. ORF61 protein transactivates certain VZV promoters and enhances the infectivity of viral DNA in transient transfections. Deletion of ORF61 results in abnormal syncytia and impairs the growth of VZV in vitro. Inoculation of cotton rats with ORF61-deleted Oka virus resulted in latent VZV infection in the nervous system similar to that seen for animals infected with parental virus. Thus, the cotton rat can be used to study the ability of mutants in the Oka vaccine strain of VZV to establish latent infection.																					BCI:BCI200300214916	12627493

Methods: A. aegypti mosquitoes were experimentally infected with ZIKV MR-766 strain via the oral feeding route. Infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed on infant CD1 mice. Sick mice were euthanized, and their organs were collected and subjected to real-time RT-PCR, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry. Results: Clinical symptoms appeared in mice after 4-5 days of being bitten by mosquitoes, following which they were euthanized. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed the presence of viral RNA in various organs such as the brain, liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and intestines of the mice. The brain tissue specimens showed higher viral loads as determined by threshold values (Ct value) in the real-time RT-PCR assay. Histopathological and immunohistochemistry studies also revealed the presence of the virus and associated lesions in the brain, indicating that ZIKV shows tropism for neuronal tissue. Conclusions: This study demonstrates ZIKV pathogenesis in infant CD1 mice and that these mice are highly susceptible to natural infection with this ZIKV strain. (c) 2018 S.

Samples of ticks were assayed on 12 occasions between days 0 and 31 after the viremic blood meal. Mean CCHF viral titers were 10(2.1) PFU per tick immediately after the viremic meal but declined to 10(1.2) PFU per tick after 2 d, and no virus was detected beyond 8 d. The percentage of ticks with detectable virus was 92% (22/24) immediately after the viremic meal, but then declined to 20% (2/10) after 4 d and to 0% (0/44) after 11 or more days. Ticks were allowed to feed on sets of three naive suckling mice on days 0, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 21, and 28 after the viremic blood meal, but CCHF viral transmission did not occur. Similarly, no transovarial transmission of virus from CCHF virus-exposed O. sonrai to their progeny was observed. These results strongly indicate that O. sonrai is not a vector of CCHF virus.																					WOS:A1993KP40200031	8459431

In the present study we tested the capacity of selected H7 and H5 HPAI viruses to infect and to be transmitted from infected BALB/c mice to contact sentinels. Previous experiments have shown that viruses belonging to both H5 and H7 subtypes replicate in the respiratory tract and central nervous system of experimentally infected mice. In this study we show that selected H7N1 and H5N1 HPAI viruses can be transmitted from mouse-to-mouse by direct contact, and that in experimentally infected animals they exhibit a different pattern of replication and transmission. Our results can be considered as a starting point for transmission experiments involving other influenza A viruses with alpha 2-3 receptor affinity in order to better understand the viral factors influencing transmissibility of these viruses in selected mammalian species.

J	Martinez, P; Favi, M; Hernandez, G; Rodriguez, L								Antigenic comparison and immune response in challenges mice with virus CVS and "street" and "fixed" isolates presumably atipics of rabies virus								ARCHIVOS DE MEDICINA VETERINARIA				31	1			55	68						1999	1999	Rabies is a disease caused by a neurotropic virus which has the capacity of infecting a wide range of animals and humans.Antigenic analysis of a wide variety of fixed (vaccine strains) and street viruses with monoclonal antibodies has revealed considerable antigenic variation among the samples of viruses isolated from different host species, or geographical locations. These marked antigenic variations have potentially serious implications for raby control strategies.We studied the patterns of "street" and "fixed" rabies virus isolates compared with the prototype Challenge Virus Standard (CVS), using the Fuenzalida-Palacios rabies Vaccine and anti-rabies serum standard. Six street rabies virus were used. These were detected and isolated in 1985, at the Public Health Institute, Chile.First, suckling mice were inoculated with street rabies virus 85/423, 85/433, 85/684, 85/882, 85/1068, 85/1091. The detection of rabies virus antigen in CNS tissues was performed with the direct immunofluorescence technique. These positive samples were used for the viral passage in mice. Next, brain tissues from mice experimentally infected with street virus were used for the next intracerebral inoculation. This street rabies Virus was fixed.We analysed the role of the Fuenzalidad-Palacios vaccine in induction of protective immune response against a lethal infection in suckling mice with six street rabies virus ( 85/423, 85/433, 85/684, 85/882, 85/1068 and 85/1091), challenge virus standard (CVS) and fixed rabies virus (85/423, 85/433, 85/684, 85/882, 85/1068 and 85/1091).To study the protection of anti-rabies serum, mice were inoculated intracerebrally with preincubated mixtures of anti-rabies serum with virus CVS and anti-rabies serum with fixed rabies virus.The results indicated that the Fuenzalida-Palacios vaccine, experimentally produced only partial protection against a lethal intracerebral challenge with rabies virus. We demonstrate that, administration of anti-rabies serum resulted in insufficient protection.Therefore, these results are suggestive to us that exist an heterogenecity in street rabies virus.

Temporal Progression of Lesions in Guinea Pigs Infected With Lassa Virus								VETERINARY PATHOLOGY				54	3			549	562		10.1177/0300985816677153				MAY 2017	2017	Lassa virus (LASV) infection causes an acute, multisystemic viral hemorrhagic fever that annually infects an estimated 100000 to 300000 persons in West Africa. This pathogenesis study evaluated the temporal progression of disease in guinea pigs following aerosol and subcutaneous inoculation of the Josiah strain of LASV as well as the usefulness of Strain 13 guinea pigs as an animal model for Lassa fever. After experimental infection, guinea pigs (Cavia porcellus; n = 67) were serially sampled to evaluate the temporal progression of infection, gross and histologic lesions, and serum chemistry and hematologic changes. Guinea pigs developed viremia on day 5 to 6 postexposure (PE), with clinical signs appearing by day 7 to 8 PE. Complete blood counts revealed lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. Gross pathologic findings included skin lesions and congested lungs. Histologic lesions consisted of cortical lymphoid depletion by day 6 to 7 PE with lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia at 7 to 8 days PE. Scattered hepatocellular degeneration and cell death were also noted in the liver and, to a lesser extent, in other tissues including the haired skin, lung, heart, adrenal gland, lymph nodes, thymus, and spleen. The first cell types to demonstrate staining for viral antigen were fibroblastic reticular cells and macrophages/dendritic cells in the lymph nodes on day 5 to 6 PE. This study demonstrates similarities between Lassa viral disease in human infections and experimental guinea pig infection. These shared pathologic characteristics support the utility of guinea pigs as an additional animal model for vaccine and therapeutic development under the Food and Drug Administration's Animal Rule.

A Rickettsia brasilien-sis e suas relacoes com a infeccao				MEM INST BUTANTAN				6				3	135						1931	1931	Study of the typhus-like infection that has been reported in Sao Paulo for the last 3 yrs. showed that R. brasiliensis represents either the causative agent or one of the stages of the virus. It occurs in the endothelial cells of Descemet's membrane after inoculation of the virus into the anterior chamber of the eye in certain laboratory animals, as well as in the mesothelial cells of the peritoneal wall after intraperitoneal inoculation. In the latter instance, its frequency reaches 73.5% of the guinea pigs inoculated, but the incidence is still higher if tests are made at a more favorable period 90.4% on the 3rd day of reaction, 93.7% on the 2nd day, and 100% on the 1st day. It is also decidedly pathogenic for guinea pigs, in which it causes a typical experimental infection, even though it be previously freed from the virus by repeated washing and centrifuging. It bears antigenic properties, and so may be used in preparation of a "bac-terin" to be applied in actively immunizing guinea pigs and in stimulating formation of specific virucidal antibodies. It has been found in sections of experimentally infected ticks (Amblyomma cajennense), which seem to be the most likely carriers of the Sao Paulo typhus under natural conditions. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A. do Amaral																					BCI:BCI19350900005265

Viral, immunologic, and disease parameters following experimental infection of laboratory mice with MHV68 closely resemble what occurs during primary EBV infection of humans, which suggests that MHV68 infection of mice offers a small animal model to study in general the pathogenesis of gammaherpesvirus infections. Diseases elicited by MHV68 infection include lymphoproliferative diseases, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and autoimmune diseases, ailments also associated with EBV infection of humans. Furthermore, MHV68 infection also is linked to the development of vasculitis, encephalomyelitis, and other disorders that resemble pathologies with viral and nonviral etiologies in humans. This review aims to provide an overview of MHV68-associated diseases in infected mice that may provide a model for understanding basic mechanisms by which similar diseases in humans occur and can be treated.

J	Kirkland, P. D.; Read, A. J.; Frost, M. J.; Finlaison, D. S.								Bungowannah virus - a probable new species of pestivirus - what have we found in the last 10 years?								ANIMAL HEALTH RESEARCH REVIEWS				16	1			60	63		10.1017/S1466252315000031				JUN 2015	2015	Bungowannah virus was discovered following an outbreak of stillbirths and sudden death in young pigs. Affected animals consistently showed a myocardopathy with signs of cardiac failure. After virus isolation and PCR investigations were unsuccessful, direct fetal inoculation was undertaken. Nucleic acid purified from serum from infected fetuses was subjected to sequence-independent single-primer amplification and nucleic acid sequencing. Sequences consistent with a pestivirus were obtained. The entire genome was identified but was genetically remote from the recognized pestivirus species. This virus was not recognized by pan-pestivirus reactive monoclonal antibodies but was subsequently detected in cell cultures by immunoperoxidase staining using convalescent sow serum. Experimental infections of sows at different stages of gestation reproduced the myocarditis syndrome. Pre-weaning losses of 70 and 29% were observed following infection at days 35 and 90, respectively. Piglets infected at day 35 were shown to be persistently infected, while chronic infections were observed after fetal infection at day 55. Chronically infected piglets showed growth retardation and were viremic for up to 7 months. Myocarditis was associated with infection in late gestation (day 90). Non-pregnant sheep and cattle have been experimentally infected but with no evidence of disease. Infection of pregnant cattle in early gestation resulted in both maternal and fetal infection, but all infected fetuses mounted an antibody response to the virus. Analysis of the nucleic acid sequence confirmed that Bungowannah has a number of changes not observed in other pestiviruses. Genes encoding some of the structural proteins remain fully functional when inserted into a bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) backbone. Cell culture-based studies have shown that Bungowannah virus will grow in cells extending from humans to bats as well as farm animals.																					WOS:000355943900008	26050573

The epidemiology of Borna disease virus (BDV), as for other members of the family Bornaviridae, is largely unknown, although evidence exists for a reservoir in small mammals, for example bank voles (Myodes glareolus). In addition to the current exogenous infections and despite the fact that bornaviruses have an RNA genome, bornavirus sequences integrated into the genomes of several vertebrates millions of years ago. Our hypothesis is that the bank vole, a common wild rodent species in traditional BDV-endemic areas, can serve as a viral host; we therefore explored whether this species can be infected with BDV, and if so, how the virus spreads and whether viral RNA is transcribed into DNA in vivo. We infected neonate bank voles intracerebrally with BDV and euthanized them 2 to 8 weeks post-infection. Specific Ig antibodies were detectable in 41%. Histological evaluation revealed no significant pathological alterations, but BDV RNA and antigen were detectable in all infected brains. Immunohistology demonstrated centrifugal spread throughout the nervous tissue, because viral antigen was widespread in peripheral nerves and ganglia, including the mediastinum, esophagus, and urinary bladder. This was associated with viral shedding in feces, of which 54% were BDV RNA-positive, and urine at 17%. BDV nucleocapsid gene DNA occurred in 66% of the infected voles, and, surprisingly, occasionally also phosphoprotein DNA. Thus, intracerebral BDV infection of bank vole led to systemic infection of the nervous tissue and viral excretion, as well as frequent reverse transcription of the BDV genome, enabling genomic integration. This first experimental bornavirus infection in wild mammals confirms the recent findings regarding bornavirus DNA, and suggests that bank voles are capable of bornavirus transmission.

J	Preuss, Mirjam A. R.; Faber, Marie-Luise; Tan, Gene S.; Bette, Michael; Dietzschold, Bernhard; Weihe, Eberhard; Schnell, Matthias J.								Intravenous Inoculation of a Bat-Associated Rabies Virus Causes Lethal Encephalopathy in Mice through Invasion of the Brain via Neurosecretory Hypothalamic Fibers								PLOS PATHOGENS				5	6					e1000485	10.1371/journal.ppat.1000485				JUN 2009	2009	The majority of rabies virus (RV) infections are caused by bites or scratches from rabid carnivores or bats. Usually, RV utilizes the retrograde transport within the neuronal network to spread from the infection site to the central nervous system (CNS) where it replicates in neuronal somata and infects other neurons via trans-synaptic spread. We speculate that in addition to the neuronal transport of the virus, hematogenous spread from the site of infection directly to the brain after accidental spill over into the vascular system might represent an alternative way for RV to invade the CNS. So far, it is unknown whether hematogenous spread has any relevance in RV pathogenesis. To determine whether certain RV variants might have the capacity to invade the CNS from the periphery via hematogenous spread, we infected mice either intramuscularly (i.m.) or intravenously (i.v.) with the dog-associated RV DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV SB. In addition to monitoring the progression of clinical signs of rabies we used immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to follow the spread of the virus from the infection site to the brain. In contrast to i.m. infection where both variants caused a lethal encephalopathy, only i.v. infection with SB resulted in the development of a lethal infection. While qRT-PCR did not reveal major differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain at different times after i.m. or i.v. infection of SB, immunohistochemical analysis showed that only i.v. administered SB directly infected the forebrain. The earliest affected regions were those hypothalamic nuclei, which are connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. Our data suggest that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for the post exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV.

The survival of infected hosts, viral replication in lungs and brains, and histopathologic changes in the two mouse strains were compared. In both strains of mice, mortality occurred during the period 7 to 10 days postinfection. However, dm2 mice were relatively resistant to lethal infections. Viral replication occurred at low levels in the lungs of both strains and did not evoked significant pathologic changes. In contrast, viral replication in the brains was much greater; in the BALB/c strain, this was accompanied by more frequent and more severe pathologic changes. In general, mice surviving at day 10 had effectively cleared virus from central nervous system but not respiratory sites. Evidence is presented that viral replication occurs first in the nasal cavity and is transmitted both to the lungs and to the olfactory bulb where focal cytopathology occurs. Virus enters the ventricles, causing encephalitis; necrosis occurs around the ventricles and in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord. Necrotic lesions were accompanied by mononuclear infiltration. Mice immunized with virus of the same serotype or with a vaccina virus hybrid encoding the VSV glycoprotein were protected from lethal infection; in contrast, mice immunized with heterotypic virus were susceptible to challenge.

J	LEGER, A.								Spirochaete infection in the blood of animals at Dakar. Its value from the point of view of epidemiology.				Spirochetose sanguine animale a Dakar. Sa Valeur au Point de Vue epidemiologique.				Bulletin de la Societe de Pathologie Exotique				11	2			64	66						1918, February 13th	1918	Since describing observations on a spirochaete in the blood of the shrew, Crocidura stampflii, at Dakar [see this Review, Ser. B., v, p. 98], an identical parasite with the same morphology and pathogenic action has been found in two individuals of Mus decumanus out of over 500 examined. The study of this spirochaete revealed morphological characters analogous to those of human relapsing fever; moreover, its development in various laboratory animals such as mice, rats, monkeys, rabbits, guineapigs, etc., enabled this virus to be compared with that of human spirochaetosis, bat without the possibility of certain identification with any of the known spirochaetes, either Russian, American, African, Indian or Tonkinese. Differentiation by means of immunity reactions would have enabled the identification to be established, but the difficulty of procuring the virus from other sources has prevented this investigation. Although relapsing fever has never to the author's knowledge been recorded in man at Dakar, nor in the Senegalese districts, it is well to be on guard against its appearance. The development of this spirochaete in the various laboratory animals indicates more or less easy transmission to man. The conditions for such transmission already exist in the colony: carriers of the virus (rats, shrews, etc.) are abundant throughout the region, living in constant contact with the natives in their houses and often passing on their ectoparasites to them. Doctors giving medical assistance to the natives of Senegal should therefore be warned of the probability of the existence of human relapsing fever, while the local administrative authorities should be urged to a strenuous campaign against the animals indicated as carriers of the virus.

Tumor development was monitored over 18 months.Results: Of 111 embryos, 20 (18%) recovered from Akv-infected SWR/J mice, which had developed normally, were infected. New proviruses were detected in 10 of 111 (9%) embryos from Akv-infected SWR/J mice, and in 2 of 60 (3%) embryos from AKR/J mice; none expressed viral protein. Of 127 embryos recovered from Akv-infected SWR/J mice, 16 (13%) were dead; 4 of 5 (80%) were infected and expressed viral protein, Of 71 embryos from AKR/J mice, 11 (15%) were dead, and 2 of 2 had virus integration; virus expression was not detected.Numbers of dead embryos recovered from experimentally infected, viremic SWR/J mice and from spontaneously endogenous MuLV-expressing AKR/J mice were significantly higher, compared with numbers from nonviremic SWR/J control mice, and embryo lethality was significantly associated with prenatal provirus expression.Postnatal inoculation of Akv induced lymphoblastic lymphomas in 15 of 24 (61%) SWR/J mice within mean +/- SD latency of 14 +/- 2.4 months. Only 3 of 39 (8%) control mice developed lymphomas (P < 0.005).Conclusion: Embryos in MuLV-viremic dams are readily infected, and inappropriate prenatal expression of leukemogenic endogenous retroviruses may play a critical role in embryo lethality and decreased breeding performance in ecotropic provirus-positive mouse strains.

We used reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction (RT-N PCR) to probe tissues of hamsters inoculated with VSV-NJ Hazelhurst. Viral genomic RNA was detected in the brain, cerebellum, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung 2 months after infection, but only in the central nervous system at 10 and 12 months. Viral messenger RNA was detected in the brain of one hamster at 2 months after infection. Replicative intermediate was detected in the spinal cord of one hamster at 12 months. These results suggest that VSV-RNA persists in animals for long periods following infection, disease, and convalescence. However, infectious virus was not recovered from tissues by conventional serial passages of tissue extracts in Vero cells or by cocultivation. (C) 1996 Academic Press, Inc.

Bats (Chiroptera) have been shown to be susceptible to experimental infection and therefore may be at risk from disease when in contact with infected people. Numerous conservation fieldwork activities are undertaken across the United Kingdom bringing potentially infected people into close proximity with bats. In this study, we analysed the risks of disease from SARS-CoV-2 to free-living bat species in England through fieldworkers undertaking conservation activities and ecological survey work, using a qualitative, transparent method devised for assessing threats of disease to free-living wild animals. The probability of exposure of bats to SARS-CoV-2 through fieldwork activities was estimated to range from negligible to high, depending on the proximity between bats and people during the activity. The likelihood of infection after exposure was estimated to be high and the probability of dissemination of the virus through bat populations medium. The likelihood of clinical disease occurring in infected bats was low, and therefore, the ecological, economic and environmental consequences were predicted to be low. The overall risk estimation was low, and therefore, mitigation measures are advisable. There is uncertainty in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in bats and therefore in the risk estimation. Disease risk management measures are suggested, including the use of personal protective equipment, good hand hygiene and following the existing government advice. The disease risk analysis should be updated as information on the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses in bats improves. The re-analysis may be informed by health surveillance of free-living bats.																					WOS:000625467100001	33570837

Rousettus aegyptiacus Bats Do Not Support Productive Nipah Virus Replication								JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES				221				S407	S413		10.1093/infdis/jiz429			4	MAY 1 2020	2020	Nipah virus (NiV) is a bat-borne zoonotic pathogen that can cause severe respiratory distress and encephalitis upon spillover into humans. NiV is capable of infecting a broad range of hosts including humans, pigs, ferrets, dogs, cats, hamsters, and at least 2 genera of bats. Little is known about the biology of NiV in the bat reservoir. In this study, we evaluate the potential for the Egyptian fruit bat (EFB), Rousettus aegyptiacus, to serve as a model organism for studying NiV in bats. Our data suggest that NiV does not efficiently replicate in EFBs in vivo. Furthermore, we show no seroconversion against NiV glycoprotein and a lack of viral replication in primary and immortalised EFB-derived cell lines. Our data show that despite using a conserved target for viral entry, NiV replication is limited in some bat species. We conclude that EFBs are not an appropriate organism to model NiV infection or transmission in bats.																					WOS:000553463400009	31682727	
J	Sidwell, RW; Smee, DF								Peramivir (BCX-1812, RWJ-270201): potential new therapy for influenza								EXPERT OPINION ON INVESTIGATIONAL DRUGS				11	6			859	869						JUN 2002	2002	The cyclopentane peramivir (BCX-1812, RWJ-270201) is a highly selective inhibitor of influenza A and B virus neuraminidases and a potent inhibitor of influenza A and B virus replication in cell culture. The in vitro potency appears to be greater than either zanamivir or oseltamivir carboxylate based on the generally lower EC50 values seen using peramivir in studies run in parallel with each compound. In mice infected with influenza A or B viruses, oral treatment with peramivir was highly effective in preventing death, signs of the disease and in lowering lung virus titres. Similar effects were seen in influenza A virus-infected ferrets. Efficacy was seen in mice when therapy began after virus exposure. Peramivir is non-toxic in mice and rats at doses of greater than or equal to 1000 mg/kg/day and ferrets tolerated doses of ! 100 mg/kg/day. Doses of 100 mg/kg/day do not appear to affect murine immune parameters. A pharmacokinetic study of this compound in influenza virus-infected mice indicates once-, twice- or thrice-daily oral dosing was equal in efficacy; once-daily dosing has been recommended in clinical trials of influenza therapy. Treatment of influenza virus infections in cyclophosphamide-immunosuppressed mice was effective in inhibiting the infection; an infection induced in severe combined immunodeficient mice was only weakly affected. Development of viral resistance to peramivir can occur by serial cell culture passage of the virus in the presence of the compound but the resistant virus was less virulent than the wild type virus. Viruses with neuraminidase mutations are not necessarily all cross-resistant to peramivir, zanamivir and oseltamivir carboxylate. In Phase I studies, peramivir was well-tolerated, with single or multiple oral doses up to 800 mg/kg/day evaluated. In clinical trials with patients experimentally infected with influenza A or B viruses, oral treatment with peramivir significantly reduced nasal wash virus titres with no adverse effects. Phase III clinical trials are underway.																					WOS:000176210200012	12036429

The assay proved to be highly sensitive as 10 RNA molecules were reproducibly amplified. BDV RNA was detected in blood cells of experimentally infected immunocompetent mice and rats. Mice were persistently infected without showing clinical signs of borna disease (BD), whereas the rats suffered from acute BD. Among 19 horses examined, five were positive for viral RNA in the blood. In a flock of sheep with a history of BD, 1 out of 25 clinically healthy animals was positive. BDV RNA was also detected in cells of the peripheral blood of 10 out of 27 selected humans with psychiatric disorders, and in 2 out of 13 healthy individuals. Remarkably BDV-specific RNA was present in some cases in the absence of BDV-specific antibodies. Sequence analysis of PCR products confirmed the specificity of the amplification system. The presence of BDV RNA in the blood of naturally and experimentally BDV-infected individuals may point to an incidental but relevant role of blood for the spread of BDV in the infected organism, as well as for the transmission of BDV to other individuals.

We investigated the zoonotic origins of the epidemic using wildlife surveys, interviews, and molecular analyses of bat and environmental samples. We found no evidence for a concurrent outbreak in larger wildlife. Exposure to fruit bats is common in the region, but the index case may have been infected by playing in a hollow tree housing a colony of insectivorous free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus). Bats in this family have previously been discussed as potential sources for Ebola virus outbreaks, and experimental data have shown that this species can survive experimental infection. These analyses expand the range of possible Ebola virus sources to include insectivorous bats and reiterate the importance of broader sampling efforts for understanding Ebola virus ecology.

Stockholm, 1953				1	Part I			343	345						1953	1953	In enzootic pneumonia of pigs in Sweden the virus infection has a slow onset and reaches a fairly high titre in the lung, remaining constant for at least a month. In artificially infected pigs the pneumonia is visible to the naked eye at the end of the second week. The persistence of the pneumonia is due to the persistence of the virus. In the rapid multiplication of the virus, enzootic pneumonia in pigs resembles 'grey lung' disease of mice and other rodents, described by Andrewes & Glover [V.B. 16, 2474] and might be aetiologically identical with the virus pneumonia of pigs in England, described by Betts [V.B. 23, 439].-H.

Isolation of strains of virus B from tissue cultures of Cynomolgus and Rhesus kidney								CANADIAN JOUR PUBL HEALTH				45	(12)			509	518						1954	1954	Six strains of Virus B were isolated from pools of polio virus prepared from the fluids harvested from large tissue cultures of monkey kidney. Five strains were obtained from pools of polio virus which had been prepared in cultures employing tissue from Rhesus animals, and one from cultures employing tissue from Cynomolgus animals, All animals were apparently quite healthy at the time of operation. The overall contamination rate with Virus B in pools of polio virus was approximately 1%. The 6 strains ail produced distinctive changes in the cells of tissue cultures of monkey kidney epithelium. The susceptibility of rabbits, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, and monkeys to these strains was investigated and the results were essentially similar to those reported for Virus B. Attempts to isolate Virus B from the blood and saliva of experimentally infected monkeys failed, but virus was recovered from the vesicle fluid in animals inoculated intradermally. Tests in tissue culture showed all strains to be neutralized by immune monkey serum to Virus B to approximately the same titer. In a 1/4000 solution of formalin at 37[degree] C, the rate of inactivation of a strain of Virus B was such-that no infectivity could be demonstrated after 22 hours. It is thus evident that Virus B is inactivated much more rapidly than is polio virus. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: C. R. Woodward, Jr																					BCI:BCI19552900026609	13230964

Based on seroprevalence studies in different voles from continental Europe and UK, voles are suspected to be the major reservoir host. Recently, a CPXV was isolated from a bank vole (Myodes glareolus) in Germany that showed a high genetic similarity to another isolate originating from a Cotton-top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus). Here we characterize this first bank vole-derived CPXV isolate in comparison to the related tamarin-derived isolate. Both isolates grouped genetically within the provisionally called CPXV-like 3 clade. Previous phylogenetic analysis indicated that CPXV is polyphyletic and CPXV-like 3 clade represents probably a different species if categorized by the rules used for other orthopoxviruses. Experimental infection studies with bank voles, common voles (Microtus arvalis) and Wistar rats showed very clear differences. The bank vole isolate was avirulent in both common voles and Wistar rats with seroconversion seen only in the rats. In contrast, inoculated bank voles exhibited viral shedding and seroconversion for both tested CPXV isolates. In addition, bank voles infected with the tamarin-derived isolate experienced a marked weight loss. Our findings allow for the conclusion that CPXV isolates might differ in their replication capacity in different vole species and rats depending on their original host. Moreover, the results indicate host-specific differences concerning CPXV-specific virulence. Further experiments are needed to identify individual virulence and host factors involved in the susceptibility and outcome of CPXV-infections in the different reservoir hosts.

At necropsy there were definite specific lesions in the liver, sometimes in the spleen and other viscera. More than 30 passages were done using inbred mice (CC57Br) which were highly sensitive to this virus. Histological examinations showed multiple focal necroses in the liver and spleen typical of mouse viral hepatitis. Virus hepatitis in inbred lines of mice experimentally infected with the MHV-3 strain can be used as a model for a study of antiviral chemotherapeutic and disinfectant preparations.

Alexandria Journal of Veterinary Sciences				49	1			103	112		10.5455/ajvs.216562				2016	2016	In the present study we tried to understand pathogenesis of equine herpes virus 9 (EHV-9) in pregnant animals through experimental infection of early and late pregnant Syrian hamsters which is considered the ideal experimental model for equidae. We described the clinical manifestations and tracked the viral load in different maternal tissues including blood, brain, uterus and placenta by using the absolute quantification technique of real time PCR. The viral load was expressed as the number of EHV-9 ORF30 gene copies and standardized against the house keeping hamster GAPDH gene. The viral load in the blood increased significantly at 6th day post infection regardless stage of infection, while it increased gradually in the brain tissue to reach maximum levels at late stages of pregnancy. In the other hand, the viral load in the uterine and placental tissues increased significantly in late trimester infected group than early trimester infected group. Clinical signs appeared on experimentally infected hamsters were very similar to that appeared in equines due to EHV-1 infection and it synchronically correlated to the viral load in different tissues. On the basis of our results we can conclude that clinical manifestations of EHV-9 are very similar to that of EHV-1 and its appearance is correlated to the increased viral multiplication in blood, brain, uterus and placental tissues of the infected animal.

H-3-labeled single-stranded RNA probes were prepared which were specific for genomic RNA and mRNAs coding for the five rabies virus proteins (N, NS, M, G, and L). Paraffin-embedded brain tissues from human cases of rabies and mice experimentally infected with the challenge virus standard (CVS)-11 strain of rabies virus and street rabies virus were examined. In CVS-infected mice, genomic RNA had a multifocal distribution in the perikarya of infected neurons, perhaps reflecting concentration of genomic RNA in viral factories. The mRNAs were more abundant than genomic RNAs in CVS- and street virus-infected mouse brains and had a diffuse distribution in the perikarya. Similar amounts of signal were present in infected neurons for mRNA coding for different rabies virus proteins. In brain tissues from human cases of rabies, genomic RNA was much more abundant than the mRNAs in infected neurons. This finding suggests either a relative block at the level of transcription or greater loss of mRNAs than of genomic RNA during the agonal period, postmortem interval, or prior to penetration of fixative during immersion fixation.

Here, we investigated the antiviral capacity of niclosamide against dengue virus (DENV) serotype 2 infection in vitro and in vivo.Principle findingNiclosamide effectively retarded DENV-induced infection in vitro in human adenocarcinoma cells (A549), mouse neuroblastoma cells (Neuro-2a), and baby hamster kidney fibroblasts (BHK-21). Treatment with niclosamide did not retard the endocytosis of DENV while niclosamide was unable to enhance the antiviral type I interferon response. Furthermore, niclosamide did not cause a direct effect on viral replicon-based expression. Niclosamide has been reported to competitively inhibit the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), and NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) signaling pathways; however, selective inhibitors of those pathways did not reduce DENV infection. Similar to the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1, both niclosamide and other protonophores, such as CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone), and FCCP (carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone), effectively reduced endosomal acidification and viral dsRNA replication. Co-administration of a single dose of niclosamide partially decreased viral replication, viral encephalitis, and mortality in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice.SignificanceThese results demonstrate that niclosamide diminishes viral infection by hindering endosomal acidification.

Human corneal epithelial cells were challenged with WNV, incubated for 1-6 days, and tested for evidence of WNV infection. Viral RNA and antigen were detected at every time point, and the virus reached a peak titer of 2.5 x 10(7) plaque-forming units (pfu)/mL at 3 days postinoculation (PI). Corneas procured from donors were incubated in culture dishes containing WNV for 1-5 days and tested for evidence of WNV. Viral RNA and antigen were detected, and the virus reached a mean peak titer of 4.9 x 10(4) pfu/mL at 5 days PI. Mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with WNV, and their eyes were harvested at 2, 5, and 8 days PI and tested for evidence of WNV. Viral RNA was detected in corneas of four of nine systemically infected mice as early as 2 days PI. We conclude that human corneal cells support WNV replication in vitro and ex vivo, and WNV may disseminate into the corneas of experimentally infected mice. These findings indicate that corneal transmission cannot be ruled out as a novel mode of human-to-human WNV transmission and additional experiments should be conducted to assess this risk further.

Tests on 973 cows in 377 cowsheds gave three reactors only, in rural districts round Port of Spain. In Tobago there were four reactors. All of these were slaughtered. Three cases of ANTHRAX occurred at the Tobago Stock Farm in one pig and two goats. 278 animals were given spore vaccine. 543 cattle from Venezuela and British Guiana were vaccinated. Bat-transmitted PARALYTIC RABIES was responsible for 57 deaths of livestock as compared with 217 in 1936 and 831 in 1935. The incidence of the disease was again highest in the north-east area in Sangre Grande district. There were no outbreaks of GLANDERS, EPIZOOTIC LYMPHANGITIS or SWINE FEVER. The following diseases were noted among livestock: -HAEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA in three pigs, STRANGLES, INFLUENZA and ULCERATIVE LYMPHANGITIS in mules, PARASITIC GASTRITIS, PNEUMONIA and OPHTHALMIA of calves; BOVINE PIROPLASMOSIS (red-water) is enzootic; BOVINE BRUCELLOSIS has a low incidence.RESEARCH.-Research on PARALYTIC RABIES transmitted by bats was carried out by the Government Medical Bacteriologist. The results briefly summarized are: -Desmodus bats are susceptible to inoculation with rabies virus and may show furious or paralytic symptoms, or there may be no clinical symptoms, but those with all forms may transmit the disease. Bats " recovered " from the furious form may still transmit infection by bites for prolonged periods, whether naturally or artificially infected.-J. A. GRIFFITHS.

Erin								Heartland Virus Epidemiology, Vector Association, and Disease Potential								VIRUSES-BASEL				10	9					498	10.3390/v10090498				SEP 2018	2018	First identified in two Missouri farmers exhibiting low white-blood-cell and platelet counts in 2009, Heartland virus (HRTV) is genetically closely related to severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV), a tick-borne phlebovirus producing similar symptoms in China, Korea, and Japan. Field isolations of HRTV from several life stages of unfed, host-seeking Amblyomma americanum, the lone star tick, implicated it as a putative vector capable of transstadial transmission. Laboratory vector competence assessments confirmed transstadial transmission of HRTV, demonstrated vertical infection, and showed co-feeding infection between A. americanum. A vertical infection rate of 33% from adult females to larvae in the laboratory was observed, while only one of 386 pools of molted nymphs (1930) reared from co-feeding larvae was positive for HRTV (maximum-likelihood estimate of infection rate = 0.52/1000). Over 35 human HRTV cases, all within the distribution range of A. americanum, have been documented. Serological testing of wildlife in areas near the index human cases, as well as in widely separated regions of the eastern United States where A. americanum occur, indicated many potential hosts such as raccoons and white-tailed deer. Attempts, however, to experimentally infect mice, rabbits, hamsters, chickens, raccoons, goats, and deer failed to produce detectable viremia. Immune-compromised mice and hamsters are the only susceptible models. Vertical infection augmented by co-feeding transmission could play a role in maintaining the virus in nature. A more complete assessment of the natural transmission cycle of HRTV coupled with serosurveys and enhanced HRTV disease surveillance are needed to better understand transmission dynamics and human health risks.

This review tabulates at least 100 mammal species with evidence of WNV exposure. Many of these exposures were detected in free-ranging mammals, while several were noted in captive individuals. In addition to exposures, this review discusses experimental infections in terms of the potential for reservoir competence of select wild mammal species. Overall, few experimental infections have been conducted on wild mammals. As such, the role of most wild mammals as potential amplifying hosts for WNV is, to date, uncertain. In most instances, experimental infections of wild mammals with WNV have resulted in no or low-level viremia. Some recent studies have indicated that certain species of tree squirrels (Sciurus spp.), eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus), and eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) develop viremia sufficient for infecting some mosquito species. Certain mammalian species, such as tree squirrels, mesopredators, and deer have been suggested as useful species for WNV surveillance. In this review article, the information pertaining to wild mammal associations with WNV is synthesized.																					WOS:000317305200002	23212739

Low-Pathogenic Avian Influenza Viruses in Wild House Mice								PLOS ONE				7	6					e39206	10.1371/journal.pone.0039206				JUN 15 2012	2012	Background: Avian influenza viruses are known to productively infect a number of mammal species, several of which are commonly found on or near poultry and gamebird farms. While control of rodent species is often used to limit avian influenza virus transmission within and among outbreak sites, few studies have investigated the potential role of these species in outbreak dynamics.Methodology/Principal Findings: We trapped and sampled synanthropic mammals on a gamebird farm in Idaho, USA that had recently experienced a low pathogenic avian influenza outbreak. Six of six house mice (Mus musculus) caught on the outbreak farm were presumptively positive for antibodies to type A influenza. Consequently, we experimentally infected groups of naive wild-caught house mice with five different low pathogenic avian influenza viruses that included three viruses derived from wild birds and two viruses derived from chickens. Virus replication was efficient in house mice inoculated with viruses derived from wild birds and more moderate for chicken-derived viruses. Mean titers (EID50 equivalents/mL) across all lung samples from seven days of sampling (three mice/day) ranged from 10(3.89) (H3N6) to 10(5.06) (H4N6) for the wild bird viruses and 10(2.08) (H6N2) to 10(2.85) (H4N8) for the chicken-derived viruses. Interestingly, multiple regression models indicated differential replication between sexes, with significantly (p<0.05) higher concentrations of avian influenza RNA found in females compared with males.Conclusions/Significance: Avian influenza viruses replicated efficiently in wild-caught house mice without adaptation, indicating mice may be a risk pathway for movement of avian influenza viruses on poultry and gamebird farms. Differential virus replication between males and females warrants further investigation to determine the generality of this result in avian influenza disease dynamics.

Mice were intraperitoneally inoculated with EMC-D on 11, 13 and 15 GD and sacrificed 3 days post inoculation. There was no significant difference in the fetal mortality among all inoculation groups. Placenta showed higher virus titer than fetus and dam's serum in all inoculation groups, and the virus titer of the fetus was lowest in the 15GD group. Histopathological changes and signals of viral RNAs detected by in situ hybridization were observed almost restricted to the spongiotrophoblast layer of the placenta in all inoculation groups, and the signals were strongest in the 11GD group. In the fetus of the 11GD group, signals of viral RNAs were also seen in myocardium and hepatocytes. Ultrastructurally, intracytoplasmic aggregations of virus-like particles in crystalline array were observed in trophoblast cells and giant cells in the spongiotrophoblast layer in all inoculation groups.

The bird developed antibody titer to rabies, detected by passive hemagglutination, 27 days after oral inoculation by ingestion. The owl suppressed the infection until corticosteroid administration, after which a maximum antibody titer was attained. Evidence of active rabies viral infection was seen by fluorescent antibody staining of oral swabs, corneal impression smears and histologic tissue smears, by suckling mouse inoculation of oral swab washings, and by transmission EM. No clinical signs of rabies virus infection were observed.																					BCI:BCI197763005214	16498892

A more specific haemagglutination-inhibition test implied that the agent was related closely to Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3), rather than Sendai virus. To isolate this virus, Vero cells were inoculated with lung homogenates of 30 young animals from the colony. One of the cultures became positive at the second passage by RT-PCR directed to the hPIV3 NP and L genes. Cytopathic effect with cell fusion was observed at the third passage. The HN gene of this virus (KK24) had > 93 % similarity to those of other hPIV3 isolates, suggesting a human origin of KK24. Experimental intranasal inoculation of KK24 into SD rats showed virus replication in the lungs at 3-5 days post-infection (p.i.). Pathological examination of the lungs at day 5 p.i. indicated a moderate detachment, degradation and apoptosis of bronchial epitheliocytes with peribronchial mononuclear infiltrations. At day 7 p.i., these changes became less prominent, and no lesions were apparent at day 10 p.i. or later. The infected rats seroconverted at day 7 p.i. On the contrary, none of the 30 experimentally infected ICR mice showed any pathological lesions in their lungs, despite seroconversion at 7 days p.i. These results suggest that hPIV3 can invade rat colonies and has a moderate and transient pathogenicity in rats. This is the first report of non-experimental hPIV3 infection in laboratory rats, unexpectedly detected by antibody screening for Sendai virus.																					WOS:000227367500024	15722534

While the human polyomaviruses BKV and JCV are ubiquitous in humans, SV40 is a simian virus which was introduced in the human population, between 1955 and 1963, by contaminated poliovaccines produced in SV40-infected monkey cells. Alternatively, SV40 or an SV40-like virus may have entered the human population before anti-poliovirus vaccination. Epidemiological evidence suggests that SV40 is now contagiously transmitted in the human population by horizontal infection, independently from the earlier contaminated poliovaccines. All three polyomaviruses transform rodent and human cells and are oncogenic in rodents. JCV induces tumors also in experimentally inoculated monkeys. Transformation and oncogenicity induced by BKV, JCV and SV40 are due to the two viral oncoproteins, the large T antigen (Tag) and the small t antigen (tag), encoded in the early region of the viral genome. Both proteins display several functions. The large Tag acts mainly by blocking the functions of p53 and pRB family tumor suppressor proteins and by inducing in host cells chromosomal aberrations and instability. The principal effect of small tag is to bind the catalytic and regulatory subunits of the protein phosphatase PP2A, thereby constitutively activating the beta-catenin pathway which drives cells into proliferation. All three polyomavi ruses are associated with specific human tumor types which correspond to the rumors induced by experimental inoculation of the three viruses in rodents and to the neoplasms arising in mice transgenic for the polyomavinis early region gene directed by the native viral early promoter-enhancer. Human tumors associated with BKV, JCV and SV40 contain viral DNA, generally episomic, express vital RNA and are positive for large Tag by immunohistochemistry. The low copy number of viral genomes in human tumors suggests that polyornaviruses may transform human cells by a "hit and run" mechanism. An autocrine-paracrine effect, involving secretion of growth factors by cells expressing polyornavirus Tag, may be responsible for recruiting to proliferation Tag-negative cells in polyornavirus-associated human tumors.

The chronically infected rodents shed virus in their urine for up to 8 months, despite the disappearance of viremia and the development of high levels of neutralizing antibodies. WNV, like most members of the Japanese encephalitis virus complex (Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), is assumed to be mainly neurotropic; little is known about the genetic basis for its renal tropism. In this study, complete sequence analyses were done to compare four WNV isolates from the urines of persistently infected hamsters with the wild-type parent virus (NY 385-99). Nucleotide changes, ranging from 0.05% to 0.09%, were identified in all of the WNV isolates from urine; most of the changes were in coding regions, causing amino acid substitutions in the E, NS1, NS2B, and NS5 proteins. The genetic changes associated with renal tropism were also accompanied by a loss of virulence for hamsters and a change in plaque morphology.																					WOS:000232548600028	16222029

RABV circulates in nature and is maintained by reservoirs that are responsible for the persistence of the disease for almost 4000 years. Considering the different pattern of pathogenicity of RABV strains in naturally and experimentally infected animals, the aim of this study was to analyze the characteristics of RABV variants isolated from the main Brazilian reservoirs, being related to a dog (variant 2), Desmodus rotundus (variant 3), crab eating fox, marmoset, and Myotis spp. Viral replication in brain tissue of experimentally infected mouse was evaluated by two laboratory techniques and the results were compared to clinical evolution from five RABV variants. The presence of the RABV was investigated in brain samples by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for quantification of rabies virus nucleoprotein gene (N gene). Virus replication is not correlated with clinical signs and evolution. The pattern of FAT is associated with RABV replication levels. Virus isolates from crab eating fox and marmoset had a longer evolution period and higher survival rate suggesting that the evolution period may contribute to the outcome. RABV virus variants had independent characteristics that determine the clinical evolution and survival of the infected mice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

P.; Pietschmann, Thomas; Steinmann, Eike								Natural reservoirs for homologs of hepatitis C virus								EMERGING MICROBES & INFECTIONS				3						e21	10.1038/emi.2014.19				MAR 26 2014	2014	Hepatitis C virus is considered a major public health problem, infecting 2%-3% of the human population. Hepatitis C virus infection causes acute and chronic liver disease, including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In fact, hepatitis C virus infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation and a vaccine is not available. Hepatitis C virus displays a narrow host species tropism, naturally infecting only humans, although chimpanzees are also susceptible to experimental infection. To date, there is no evidence for an animal reservoir of viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus which may have crossed the species barrier to cause disease in humans and resulted in the current pandemic. In fact, due to this restricted host range, a robust immunocompetent small animal model is still lacking, hampering mechanistic analysis of virus pathogenesis, immune control and prophylactic vaccine development. Recently, several studies discovered new viruses related to hepatitis C virus, belonging to the hepaci- and pegivirus genera, in small wild mammals (rodents and bats) and domesticated animals which live in close contact with humans (dogs and horses). Genetic and biological characterization of these newly discovered hepatitis C virus-like viruses infecting different mammals will contribute to our understanding of the origins of hepatitis C virus in humans and enhance our ability to study pathogenesis and immune responses using tractable animal models. In this review article, we start with an introduction on the genetic diversity of hepatitis C virus and then focus on the newly discovered viruses closely related to hepatitis C virus. Finally, we discuss possible theories about the origin of this important viral human pathogen.																					WOS:000339237600001	26038514

Understanding the ecology and pathogenesis of hantaviruses requires an interdisciplinary research approach, which links laboratory experiments with results gained from field studies. Although several studies report hantavirus persistence and tissue infection patterns for experimentally infected rodents, field data is very limited. For this reason, the aim of our study was to investigate Puumala, Dobrava and Saaremaa virus RNA loads and tissue infection patterns in their natural reservoirs. Hantavirus RNA was demonstrated in all tested internal organs and blood samples of 14 naturally infected rodent hosts. However, the concentration of a specific virus differs depending on the virus, the host and the organ tested. Above all, the Dobrava virus showed a considerably higher viral load in all internal organs and blood samples of infected Apodemus flavicollis hosts. Results obtained in the study support the thesis that virus RNA load reaches its peak in the first month after infection, presumably after the virus has spread throughout all internal organs. This also implies that recently infected rodents are more important for transmission of the virus in the community. (C) 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Korean Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology				36	1			12	20						MAR 2008	2008	Validation of viral safety is essential in ensuring the safety of mammalian cell culture-derived biopharmaceuticals, because numerous adventitious viruses have been contaminated during the manufacture of the products. Mammalian cells are highly susceptible to minute virus of mice(MVM), and there are several reports of MVM contamination during the manufacture of biopharmaceuticals. In order to establish the validation system for the MVM safety, a real-time PCR method was developed for quantitative detection of MVM in cell lines, raw materials, manufacturing processes, and final products as well as MVM clearance validation. Specific primers for amplification of MVM DNA was selected, and MVM DNA was quantified by use of SYBR Green I The sensitivity of the assay was calculated to be 6 x 10(-2) TCI50/mL. The real-time PCR method was proven to be reproducible and very specific to MVM. The established real-time PCR assay was successfully applied to the validation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell artificially infected with MVM. MVM DNA could be quantified in CHO cell as well as culture supernatant. When the real-time PCR assay was applied to the validation of virus removal during a virus filtration process, the result was similar to that of virus infectivity assay. Therefore, it was concluded that this rapid, specific, sensitive, and robust assay could replace infectivity assay for detection and clearance validation of MVM.

Scid mice infected by the intraperitoneal route died or were moribund at dose-dependent times ranging from 12 to 13 days after inoculation for greater-than-or-equal-to 3.00 x 10(4) plaque forming units (pfu) of virus to 25 days for 1.17 x 10(2) pfu. Histologic lesions included severe adrenal necrosis at low doses and splenic necrosis at high doses. Multinucleate hepatocytes with multiple inclusion bodies were observed at all doses. In visceral organs, the inflammatory response consisted of cell necrosis and neutrophil infiltration. Scid mice infected with 1.00 x 10(3) pfu by the intranasal route were moribund by 24 or 25 days after inoculation. Viral titers in tissues examined from these mice increased in all organs examined until they became moribund. BALB/c mice infected intranasally had detectable virus titers in the adrenal glands, salivary glands, lungs, and spleen by 7 or 14 days after inoculation, but decreased thereafter. These mice remained clinically normal through the infection. In BALB/c mice, histologic lesions were present only in the salivary glands.																					WOS:A1993LW98300003	8231084

Prenatal or perinatal infection can be pathogenic or lead to persistent infection, whereas infection of adult rats is typically self-limiting. Effects on the host immune system have been documented during RV infection, but little is known about immune responses necessary for viral clearance. Our studies were conducted to identify humoral and cellular responses to the predominant capsid protein, VP2, during experimental infection of adult rats. We observed VP2-specific proliferation, gamma interferon production, and an immunoglobulin G2a Immoral response that is maintained for at least 35 days following RV infection. These results strongly suggest the induction of virus-specific Th1-mediated immunity.																					WOS:000177849100048	12208983

Quantitation of Acute Phase Proteins and Protein Electrophoresis in Monitoring the Acute Inflammatory Process in Experimentally and Naturally Infected Mice								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				60	4			263	271						AUG 2010	2010	Serologic screening for infectious disease in sentinel mice from rodent colonies is expensive and labor-intensive, often involving multiple assays for several different infectious agents. Previously, we established normal reference ranges for the protein fractions of several laboratory strains of mice by using a commercially available agarose system of protein electrophoresis. In the current study, we address protein fractionation and quantitation of acute phase proteins (APP) in mice experimentally infected with Sendai virus or mouse parvovirus. We further investigate this methodology by using samples from sentinel mice from colonies with endemic infection. All study groups showed significant increases in globulins. Various other protein fractions showed mild variable changes; significant differences were not detected for individual APP. These results contrast the significant changes observed in APP and protein electrophoresis by using the standard methods of inducing inflammatory responses through injection of complete Freund adjuvant or LPS. These present data suggest that although quantitation of individual APP may not be helpful, 7 globulin levels may reflect infection in laboratory mice and provide a possible adjunct to traditional screening methods.

The results showed that the MDT and ICPI of the virus were 120 hours and 0, respectively. In addition, no morbidity or mortality were observed in the 4 week old SPF chickens inoculated oculonasally with the APMV-2, and the virus was isolated from trachea, small intestine, and brain at 2 days post inoculation (dpi), and from lung and heart at 4 dpi. However, no clinical disorder was observed in any of the artificially infected mice and no virus was detected from the tissue samples collected during the experiment.

To investigate whether B cells are important for controlling mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 infection, we infected muMT mice who lack membrane-bound IgM and therefore mature B lymphocytes. Infectious virus peaked and was cleared from the livers of muMT and wild-type mice. However, while virus was cleared from the CNS of wild-type mice, virus persisted in the CNS of muMT mice. To determine how B cells mediate viral clearance, we first assessed CD4(+) T cell activation in the absence of B cells as APC. CD4+ T cells express wild-type levels of CD69 after infection in muMT mice. IFN-gamma production in response to viral Ag in muMT mice was also normal during acute infection, but was decreased 31 days postinfection compared with that in wild-type mice. The role of Ab in viral clearance was also assessed. In wild-type mice plasma cells appeared in the CNS around the time that virus is cleared. The muMT mice that received A59-specific Ab had decreased virus, while mice with B cells deficient in Ab secretion did not clear virus from the CNS. Viral persistence was not detected in FcR or complement knockout mice. These data suggest that clearance of infectious mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 from the CNS requires Ab production and perhaps B cell support of T cells; however, virus is cleared from the liver without the involvement of Abs or B cells.

Here, we designed a mathematical model to characterize the viral dynamics in 20 mice experimentally infected with Ebola virus, which were either left untreated or treated with favipiravir at 6 or 8 days post infection. This approach provided estimates of kinetic parameters of Ebola virus reproduction, such as the half-life of productively infected cells, of about 6 h, and the basic reproductive number which indicates that virus produced by a single infected cell productively infects about 9 new cells. Furthermore, the model predicted that favipiravir efficiently blocks viral production, reaching an antiviral effectiveness of 95% and 99.6% at 2 and 6 days after initiation of treatment, respectively. The model could be particularly helpful to guide future studies evaluating favipiravir in larger animals. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One clone designated V3-2B specifically bound to native and SDS-treated viral specific antigens. Immunocytochemical studies of infected gills revealed viral specific immunoreactivities in the cytoplasm of gill tissue and in haemocytes. No antibody binding was observed in gills from non-infected shrimp. in addition, immunocytochemical examination of tissues from shrimp experimentally infected with YHV gave a positive reaction, while tissues from uninfected control shrimp or shrimp experimentally infected with WSSV did not. Western blot analysis indicated that the antibody reacted with a protein of approximately 135 kD that was present only in shrimp infected with YHV. In dot-blot indirect immunoperoxidase assays, the antibody was able to detect viral associated antigen in diluted haemolymph up to 1:50 dilution and in an ammonium sulfate precipitate of haemolymph up to 1:1000 dilution. The results suggested that this antibody might be useful for development of effective diagnostic techniques for both heavy and mild YHV infections in shrimp.

A number of aspects have been studied quite deeply; however, there are still areas that require additional research. These include the development of a fully adequate laboratory model for reproducing bovine leukosis virus (BLV) infection. Preliminary studies have established that BLV infection of laboratory rats is accompanied by clinical, morphological and biochemical changes in the blood, signs of immune suppression, impaired immunological reactivity of the body, and morphofunctional changes in the immunocompetent cells that correlate with bovine leukosis. In this regard, it is of interest to analyze disorders caused by these dysfunctions; the disorders are demonstrated by changed morphometric characteristics of both the body and individual organs. The aim of the research was to study dynamic changes in body mass and mass of internal organs in laboratory rats experimentally infected with BLV. There was a clear body mass increase in BLV-infected laboratory rats, then followed by a decrease down to negative numbers. The reverse trend was observed for such internal organs of the experimental animals as liver, spleen, kidneys and lungs. At first, their relative mass decreased to some extent, then increased with different dynamics in groups. The heart was the exception, as its relative mass decreased and did not increase until the end of the experiment. The data obtained correlate with those provided by a number of authors that the relative mass of various organs changes in the BLV infected animals because of proliferative, inflammatory, dystrophic and atrophic processes.			Энзоотический лейкоз крупного рогатого скота уже более ста лет является актуальной проблемой ветеринарной медицины как в Российской Федерации, так и за рубежом. Ряд аспектов изучен достаточно глубоко, но есть и такие, что требуют проведения дополнительных исследований. К их числу относится разработка адекватной во всех отношениях лабораторной модели для воспроизведения инфекции, вызванной вирусом лейкоза крупного рогатого скота (BLV-инфекция). Предварительными исследованиями было установлено, что BLV-инфекция лабораторных крыс сопровождается коррелирующими с лейкозом у крупного рогатого скота клинико-морфологическими и биохимическими изменениями в крови, признаками иммунной супрессии, нарушением иммунологической реактивности организма и морфофункциональными изменениями на уровне иммунокомпетентных клеток. В этой связи интерес представляет анализ провоцируемых данными дисфункциями нарушений, находящих свое отражение в изменении морфометрических характеристик как всего организма, так и отдельных органов. Целью исследований стало изучение динамики массы тела и внутренних органов лабораторных крыс при экспериментальной BLV-инфекции. Динамика весовых показателей тела BLV-инфицированных лабораторных крыс характеризовалась выраженной тенденцией к их увеличению с последующим снижением вплоть до отрицательных значений. Обратная тенденция была отмечена для таких внутренних органов экспериментальных животных, как печень, селезенка, почки и легкие. Сначала их относительная масса в той или иной степени снижалась, затем увеличивалась с разной динамикой по группам. Исключение составило сердце, относительная масса которого снизилась и не увеличивалась до окончания эксперимента. Полученные данные коррелируют с мнением ряда авторов, что при BLV-инфекции относительная масса различных органов изменяется в результате пролиферативных, воспалительных, дистрофических и атрофических процессов.

This is well studied for herpesviruses, rabies-related viruses, and a few others, but it is poorly investigated among almost all arboviruses. In this study, we describe both the neurotropism and the neuropathological effects of Amazonian rhabdoviruses on the brains of experimentally infected-newborn mice. Suckling mice were intranasally infected with 10(-4) to 10(-8) LD50 of viruses. Animals were anaesthetized and perfused after they had become sick. Immunohistochemistry using specific anti-virus and anti-active caspase three antibodies was performed. All infected animals developed fatal encephalitis. Survival time ranged from 18 h to 15 days. Viruses presented distinct species-dependant neurotropism for CNS regions. Histopathological analysis revealed variable degrees of necrosis and apoptosis in different brain regions. These results showed that viruses belonging to the Rhabdoviridae family possess distinct tropism for CNS structures and induce different pattern of cell death depending on the CNS region.

J	Naslund, Jonas; Lagerqvist, Nina; Habjan, Matthias; Lundkvist, Ake; Evander, Magnus; Ahlm, Clas; Weber, Friedemann; Bucht, Goran								Vaccination with virus-like particles protects mice from lethal infection of Rift Valley Fever Virus								VIROLOGY				385	2			409	415		10.1016/j.virol.2008.12.012				MAR 15 2009	2009	Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) regularly accounts for severe and often lethal outbreaks among livestock and humans in Africa. Safe and effective veterinarian and human vaccines are highly needed. We present evidence that administration of RVF virus-like particles (VLPs) induces protective immunity in mice. In an accompanying paper, (Habjan, M., Penski, N., Wagner, V., Spiegel, M., Overby, A.K, Kochs, G., Huiskonen, J., Weber, E, 2009. Efficient production of Rift Valley fever virus-like particles: the antiviral protein MxA can inhibit primary transcription of Bunyaviruses. Virology 385, 400-408) we report the production of these VLPs in mammalian cells. After three subsequent immunizations with 1 x 10(6) VLPs/dose, high titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies were detected; 11 out of 12 mice were protected from challenge and only I out of 42 mice survived infection in the control groups. VLP vaccination efficiently suppressed replication of the challenge virus, whereas in the control animals high RNA levels and increasing antibody titers against the nucleocapsid protein indicated extensive viral replication. Our study demonstrates that the RVF VLPs are highly immunogenic and confer protection against RVFV infection in mice. In the test groups, the vaccinated mice did not exhibit any side effects, and the lack of anti-nucleocapsid protein antibodies serologically distinguished vaccinated animals from experimentally infected animals.

J	Chany, C								Involvement of temperature sensitive syncytium inducing VSV or defective retroviruses in the development of spongiform encephalopathies								BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY				51	10			446	448		10.1016/S0753-3322(97)82323-2				1997	1997	Various enveloped viruses can induce syncytia in competent cells. Some temperature-sensitive mutants can express the trans-membrane viral G antigen under non-permissive conditions. The G antigen can then migrate at long distances, engulfing thousands of cells without producing any virus. When a temperature-sensitive vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infects a sensitive host, and under the condition that the G antigen is expressed, spongiosis can be induced in the central nervous system in the absence of detectable virus multiplication. We postulate that such a mechanism might be observed with various enveloped viruses, as recently illustrated with knock-out mice experimentally infected with defective murine leukemia virus (MULV).

Mutations in the E2 Glycoprotein and the 3 ' Untranslated Region Enhance Chikungunya Virus Virulence in Mice								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				91	20					e00816-17	10.1128/JVI.00816-17				OCT 2017	2017	Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted alphavirus that causes debilitating musculoskeletal pain and inflammation and can persist for months to years after acute infection. Although studies of humans and experimentally infected animals suggest that CHIKV infection persists in musculoskeletal tissues, the mechanisms for this remain poorly understood. To evaluate this further, we isolated CHIKV from the serum of persistently infected Rag1(-/-) mice at day 28. When inoculated into naive wild-type (WT) mice, this persistently circulating CHIKV strain displayed a capacity for earlier dissemination and greater pathogenicity than the parental virus. Sequence analysis revealed a nonsynonymous mutation in the E2 glycoprotein (E2 K200R) and a deletion within the 3 ' untranslated region (3 '-UTR). The introduction of these changes into the parental virus conferred enhanced virulence in mice, although primary tropism for musculoskeletal tissues was maintained. The E2 K200R mutation was largely responsible for enhanced viral dissemination and pathogenicity, although these effects were augmented by the 3 '-UTR deletion. Finally, studies with Irf3/Irf7(-/-) and Ifnar1(-/-) mice suggest that the E2 K200R mutation enhances viral dissemination from the site of inoculation independently of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-, IRF7-, and IFNAR1-mediated responses. As our findings reveal viral determinants of CHIKV dissemination and pathogenicity, their further study should help to elucidate host-virus interactions that determine acute and chronic CHIKV infection.IMPORTANCE CHIKV is a globally spreading, mosquito-transmitted virus that causes debilitating acute and chronic musculoskeletal disease in humans. The viral genetic determinants that dictate the severity of acute and chronic diseases are not understood. To improve our understanding of CHIKV pathogenesis, we evaluated a CHIKV strain isolated from the serum of chronically infected immunocompromised mice. Sequence analysis of this persistent CHIKV strain identified two mutations, an amino acid change in the E2 viral attachment protein and a deletion within the 3 '-UTR of the viral genome. We identified roles for these mutations in the enhancement of viral dissemination from the inoculation site and in disease severity. These data improve our understanding of the viral determinants of CHIKV pathogenesis and adaptive changes that occur during viral persistence.																					WOS:000411845000014	28747508

The HA head contains five immunodominant antigenic sites, all of which are subject to antigenic drift, thereby limiting vaccine efficacy. Bypassing the immune system's tendency to focus on the most variable regions of the HA may be a step toward more broadly protective influenza vaccines. However, this requires a better understanding of the biological meaning of immunodominance, and of the hierarchy between different antigenic sites. In this issue of the JCI, Liu et al. determined the immunodominance of the five antigenic sites of the HA head in experimentally infected mice, guinea pigs, and ferrets. All three species exhibited different preferences for the five sites of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. Moreover, human subjects exhibited yet a different pattern of immunodominance following immunization with the standard inactivated influenza vaccine. Together, these results have important implications for influenza vaccine design and interpretation of animal models.																					WOS:000448967200003	30295644

Intranasal inoculation of animals with a liquid inoculum is one of the main methods used to experimentally infect animals with influenza virus; however, this method does not reflect the natural infection with influenza virus by contact or aerosol route. Aerosol inhalation methods have been established with several influenza viruses for mouse and ferret models, but few studies have evaluated inoculation routes in a nonhuman primates (NHP) model. Here, we performed the experimental infection of NHPs with a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus via the aerosol route and demonstrated that aerosol infection had no effect on clinical outcome, but caused broader infection throughout all of the lobes of the lung compared with a non-aerosolized approach. Aerosol infection therefore represents an option for inoculation of NHPs in future studies.																					WOS:000427687200002	29556081

Constant generation of new mutations allows RNA viruses to adapt swiftly to a novel environment through selection of both pre-existing and de novo-generated genetic variants. Here, quasispecies dynamics were studied in vivo in controlled hantavinus transmission from experimentally infected to naive rodents through infested cage bedding. An elementary step of virus microevolution was apparent, as one synonymous mutation (A759G) repeatedly became fixed in the viral RNA quasispecies populations in the recipient animals.

An understanding of VZV neurotropism in humans has long been hampered by the lack of an adequate animal model. For example, experimental inoculation of VZV in small animals including guinea pigs and cotton rats results in the infection of ganglia but not a rash. The severe combined immune deficient human (SCID-hu) model allows the study of VZV neurotropism for human neural sub-populations. Simian varicella virus (SVV) infection of rhesus macaques (RM) closely resembles both human primary VZV infection and reactivation, with analyses at early times after infection providing valuable information about the extent of viral replication and the host immune responses. Indeed, a critical role for CD4 T-cell immunity during acute SVV infection as well as reactivation has emerged based on studies using RM. Herein we discuss the results of efforts from different groups to establish an animal model of VZV neurotropism.																					WOS:000475308000020	31159224

Ciencia Animal				30	Suppl. 2			166	170						2020	2020	The Zika virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus. It is an arbovirus whose main vectors are mosquitoes of the genus Aedes. Studies in rodents have shown that the persistence of the virus in the testicles causes damage to the reproductive tissue. This work aimed to study the effect of experimental infection by the Zika virus on fertility in non-human primates of the species Saimiri collinsi. Five pre-pubertal males (≤2 years old) of the species Saimiri collinsi were used. Three animals were infected (infected group) with the strain of Zika virus BE H815744. Two other uninfected males were used as a negative control (uninfected group). Twenty-one days after infection, infected and uninfected males were euthanized. After euthanasia, they were referred for necroscopic examination for macroscopic and microscopic evaluation. During the necropsy, the testicles were collected and fixed in 10% formaldehyde. After fixation, the tissues were processed routinely and embedded in paraffin. The slides were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histopathological evaluation. Histopathological changes were observed in the testis of three of the five animals. Different degrees of inflammation were identified, in addition to degeneration and/or necrosis. The three animals presented a reduced number of sperm cells, with no sperm and severe necrosis. The results obtained conclude that the Zika virus can cause pathological changes in the reproductive system of males of the species Saimiri collinsi.

J	Daniels, MJ; Selgrade, MK; Doerfler, D; Gilmour, MI								Kinetic profile of influenza virus infection in three rat strains								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				53	3			293	298						JUN 2003	2003	Influenza is a respiratory tract disease of viral origin that can cause major epidemics in humans. The influenza virus infects and damages epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and causes pneumonia. Lung lesions of mice infected with influenza virus resembles those seen in humans with influenza, and can result in severe and even fatal pneumonia. In contrast, experimental infection of rats with the virus induces a milder form of the disease, with no mortality. The purpose of the study reported here was to determine the time course of influenza infection and lung injury in Brown Norway (BN), Fischer-344 (F344), and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to ascertain whether genetic background impacts susceptibility to infection and host responses. Rats of each strain were inoculated intranasally with 10,000 plaque-forming units of rat-adapted influenza virus (RAIV), and lungs were assessed at postinoculation hour (PIH) 2, 24, 48, 72, and 144 for viral titer, inflammatory cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and biochemical indicators of lung edema (protein) and injury (lactate dehydrogenase [LD] activity). Virus titer peaked at PIH 24, and was 100-fold higher in the F344 and SD, compared with the BN strain. Alveolar macrophages, LD activity, and total protein concentration were higher in the BN rats, whereas neutrophil numbers and interleukin 6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha activities were greatest in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of F344 and SD rats. The results indicate that F344 and SD rats respond in similar manner to viral infection, whereas viral replication was more limited in BN rats and was associated with a different profile of pulmonary cells.

As in humans, such experimental inoculation leads to chronic infection, and HTLV-1 provirus was detected in PBMCs by PCR, Chronically infected monkeys developed high titers of antibodies against the structural proteins of the virus, as do HTLV-1-infected humans. Furthermore, in serially sacrificed squirrel monkeys infected with HTLV-1, proviral DNA was detected at primary phases of infection in PBMCs, spleens, and lymph nodes. Tax/rex mRNA was also detected by RT-PCR in the PBMCs of two monkeys at 12 days after inoculation and in the spleen and lymph nodes of the monkey sacrificed on Day 12, In this animal, scattered HTLV-1-tax/rex mRNA-positive lymphocytes were detected by in situ hybridization in frozen sections of the spleen. These results indicate that PBMCs, spleen, and lymph nodes serve as major reservoirs for HTLV-1 during the early phase of infection. To evaluate the relationship between viral expression and the immune response during infection, humoral and cytotoxic T cell responses (CTL) were studied at various times after inoculation. Antibodies to HTLV-1 were detected 3 weeks after infection and anti-p40Tax and anti-Env CTL activity was detected 2 months after infection and remained detectable thereafter. Our results indicate that the squirrel monkey provides a useful animal model for studying the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 and for evaluating new candidate vaccines.

A CA16 virus strain, named 419, was used as the production strain. Another CA16 strain, named 1131, was isolated an used as the challenge strain in intracerebral inoculation of neonatal mice for the calculation of median lethal dose (LD50). In the passive and maternal antibody-protection challenge systems, all results indicated that the vaccine could protect mouse pups from lethal challenge with the CA16 virus. In the immunogenicity systems, three types of animal (mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey), were immunized with the 419/CA16 vaccine. The dose-effect relationship and the antibody-generation routine were described. The CA16 vaccine induced a more potent serum antibody effect in rat than in mouse. The serum antibody titer was detectable more than 63 days after the initial vaccination. We also identified tools to evaluate the effect of the BPL-inactivated CA16 vaccine.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao / Chinese Journal of Preventive Veterinary Medicine				33	12			970	973						2011	2011	To prepare monoclonal antibody (MAb) against nucleocapsid protein (NP) of bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 (BPIV3), BALB/c mice were immunized with purified recombinant NP (rNP) expressed by E. coli and a hybridoma secreting MAb was screened from fusing the SP2/0 cells with the spleen cells of the immunized BALB/c mice by indirect ELISA coated with BPIV3. The titers of MAb in ascites were 2*106 and 1.28*105 as detected by rNP and BPIV3 coated ELISA, respectively. The MAb was specifically reacted with BPIV3 identified by indirect ELISA, western blot, immunofluroescence assay. The specific tests indicated the MAb had no reaction with infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus. The BPIV3 was detected in experimentally infected animals in immunohistochemical test with the MAb. Therefore, this MAb could be used to establish diagnosis method for BPIV3 and further study on the structure and function of NP.																					CABI:20123032929

The ticks were infected by engorgement on white mice which had been inoculated intracerebrally with 0.03 ml of a 10% mouse brain suspension of the EEE virus. After 66 and 86 days attempts were made to siolate the virus and inject it into infant mice. Positive isolation experiments were supplemented by a neutralization test for identification of the virus, using hyperimmune horse serum with a neutralization index of over 1,000,000 with homologous virus. The EEE virus was isolated from experimentally infected hibernating larvae and nymphs of I. ricinus under natural conditions after 86 days and from females of I. ricinus after 66 days. It was not isolated from males of I. ricinus and from females and males of Dermacentor marginatus. It was likewise not isolated from the eggs and larvae of the 2d generation of both species or from females of I. ricinus which had finished laying their eggs. A guinea pig on which 20 half-engorged females of D. marginatus were allowed to complete engorgement did not form specific antibodies. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: MDS																					BCI:BCI19603500067744	14437006

IFN and Perforin Cooperate to Control Infection and Prevent Fatal Pathology During Persistent Gammaherpesvirus Infection in Mice								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				79	6			395	403		10.1111/sji.12176				JUN 2014	2014	Infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 has become an accepted model for studying the virus/host interactions with regard to gammaherpesvirus infections. Previous studies using gene-deficient mice have revealed that neither IFN nor perforin is essential in controlling the outcome of infection or the virus load during chronic infection in C57BL/6 mice. However, pronounced multiorgan fibrosis and splenic atrophy are observed in mice lacking IFN or the IFN receptor. To study the interplay between perforin and IFN in controlling the virus-induced pathology and the viral load during chronic gammaherpesvirus infection, we infected IFN/perforin double-deficient C57BL/6 mice and followed the course of infection. While absence of perforin prevented the splenic atrophy in IFN-deficient mice, fibrosis did not disappear. Moreover, double-deficient mice developed extreme splenomegaly, were unable to control the viral load and displayed chronic immune activation. Thus, IFN and perforin act in concert to minimize pathology and control the viral load in mice chronically infected with MHV68. Furthermore, while certain aspect of the virus-induced pathology in IFN-deficient mice may be alleviated in double-deficient mice, other aspects are exaggerated, and the normal architecture of the spleen is completely destroyed. We believe that these findings add to the understanding of the virus/host interaction during chronic gammaherpes virus infection.																					WOS:000337588500006	24684620

The method was evaluated using sera from cattle experimentally infected with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Virus-infected cells, which were fixed and permeabilized, were incubated with diluted sera from immunized or control animals. Monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against different viral proteins were added, and detected with ALEXA488-conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibodies. The fluorescence signals were detected by flow cytometry and determined as mean channel values. Results were expressed as percent fluorescence inhibition compared to standardized negative sera. The FACS-IFI test with sera from experimentally infected animals was highly sensitive and specific. Comparison of the FACS-IFI results with a commercially available blocking ELISA, an indirect ELISA and the standard serum neutralization test showed a strong correlation. Furthermore, the detection of protein-specific antibodies was possible using the FACS-IFI test.																					WOS:000237303300006	16716049

C	Rupprecht, CE; Hanlon, CA; Slate, D						Schudel, A; Lombard, M		Oral vaccination of wildlife against rabies: Opportunities and challenges in prevention and control								CONTROL OF INFECTIOUS ANIMAL DISEASES BY VACCINATION		Developments in Biologicals		119				173	184						2004	2004	Rabies is an acute, progressive, fatal encephalitis caused by viruses in the Family Rhabdoviridae, Genus Lyssavirus. Rabies virus is the representative member of the group. Warm-blooded vertebrates are susceptible to experimental infection, but major primary hosts for disease perpetuation encompass bats and mammalian carnivores. The dog is the global reservoir, and important wild carnivores include foxes, raccoons, skunks, and mongoose, among others. Traditionally, reliance upon long-term, widespread, government-supported programmes aimed at population reduction of animals at risk has been unsuccessful as the sole means of rabies control, based in part upon economical, ecological and ethical grounds. In contrast, immunization of domestic dogs with traditional veterinary vaccines by the parenteral route led to the virtual extinction of canine-transmitted rabies in developed countries. Taken from this basic concept of applied herd immunity, the idea of wildlife vaccination was conceived during the 1960s, and modified-live rabies, viruses were used for the experimental oral vaccination of carnivores by the 1970s. The development of safe and effective rabies virus vaccines applied in attractive baits resulted in the first field trials in Switzerland in 1978. Thereafter, technical improvements occurred in vaccine quality and production, including the design of recombinant viruses, as well as in the ease of mass distribution of millions of edible baits over large geographical areas. Over the past few decades, extensive oral vaccination programmes focusing upon the red fox, using hand and aerial distribution of vaccine-laden baits, have resulted in the virtual disappearance of rabies in Western Europe. The same dramatic observation held true for southern Ontario. During the 1990s in the United States, oral vaccination programmes concentrated upon raccoons, grey foxes, and coyotes, with similar success. For example, raccoon rabies has not spread west of the current focus in the eastern states, grey fox rabies is contained in west central Texas, and no recent cases of rabies have been reported from coyotes away from the Mexican border for several years. Despite the progress observed and the absence of substantive adverse environmental or health effects, oral vaccination is not a panacea, and should be viewed as an important adjunct to traditional prevention and control techniques in human and veterinary medicine. Local outbreak suppression of rabies among free-ranging wildlife is documented, and regional elimination of particular virus variants among specific, targeted carnivore hosts is demonstrable, but true disease eradication is not achievable at the present time by current techniques. For example, no practical vaccination methods have been designed for bats. Although lyssaviruses appear in relative compartmentalization between the Chiroptera and Carnivora, major spillover events have been detected from bats to carnivores, and phylogenetic analyses suggest a historical basis for extant viral origins due to interactions between these taxa. Thus, bio-political considerations aside, the possibility for pathogen emergence resulting from transmission by rabid bats with subsequent perpetuation among other animals cannot be discounted easily on any continent, with the possible exception of Antarctica. Clearly, given their biodiversity, distribution, and abundance, novel methods would be necessary to consider meaningful control of rabies in these unique volant mammals.Newer approaches in biotechnology may be envisaged some day for eventual extenson to bats, as well as more widespread application to global canine rabies remediation in developing countries.

Experimentally infected B10.BR mice remain healthy unless specific antiviral T cells that infiltrate the infected brain are triggered by immunization. In contrast, infected MRL mice spontaneously mount an antiviral T-cell response that can result in meningoencephalitis and neurological disease. The antiviral T cells may, alternatively, eliminate the virus without inducing disease if they are present in sufficient numbers before the virus replicates to high titers. Since the immune response of H-2(k) mice is directed mainly against the epitope TELEISSI located in the viral nucleoprotein N, we generated BDV mutants that feature TQLEISSI in place of TELEISSI. We show that adoptive transfer of BDV N-specific CD8 T cells induced neurological disease in B10.BR mice persistently infected with wild-type BDV but not with the mutant virus expressing TQLEISSI. Surprisingly, the mutant virus replicated less well in adult MRL wild-type mice than in mutant mice lacking mature CD8 T cells. Furthermore, when MRL mice were infected with the TQLEISSI-expressing BDV mutant as newborns, neurological disease was observed, although at a lower rate and with slower kinetics than in mice infected with wild-type virus. These results confirm that TELEISSI is the major CD8 T-cell epitope in H-2(k) mice and suggest that unidentified minor epitopes are present in the BDV proteome which are recognized rather efficiently by antiviral T cells if the dominant epitope is absent.

It is known that production of inhibitory factors may result in the inability of the host to clear viruses, resulting in chronic viral persistence. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) has been identified as a novel effector molecule of CD4(+)CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells that inhibits immune activity by binding to FC gamma RIIB expressed primarily on antigen presenting cells (APC). In this study, we show that infection of mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus WE (LCMV WE) leads to increased plasma levels of FGL2, which were detected as early as 2 days post-infection (pi) and persisted until day 50 pi. Mice deficient in FGL2 (fgl2(-/-)) had increased viral titers of LCMV WE in the liver early p.i but cleared the virus by day 12 similar to wild type mice. Dendritic cells (DC) isolated from the spleens of LCMV WE infected fgl2(-/-) had increased expression of the DC maturation markers CD80 and MHC Class II compared to wild type (fgl2(+/+)). Frequencies of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells producing IFN gamma in response to ex vivo peptide re-stimulation isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes were also increased in LCMV WE infected fgl2(-/-) mice. Increased frequencies of CD8(+) T cells specific for LCMV tetramers GP(33) and NP396 were detected within the liver of fgl2(-/-) mice. Plasma from fgl2(-/-) mice contained higher titers of total and neutralizing anti-LCMV antibody. Enhanced anti-viral immunity in fgl2(-/-) mice was associated with increased levels of serum alanine transaminase (ALT), hepatic necrosis and inflammation following LCMV WE infection. These data demonstrate that targeting FGL2 leads to early increased viral replication but enhanced anti-viral adaptive T & B cell responses. Targeting FGL2 may enhance the efficacy of current anti-viral therapies for hepatotropic viruses.																					WOS:000325819400001	24146739

Methods Serum HI antibody titers of 30 mice were detected at day I to 19 after being inoculated with 0.2 ml immune serum to estimate half life of immune serum. Ten mice clinical symptom was recorded to estimate the serum security after mice injected 1.5 ml immune serum. Seventy mice were randomly divided into 7 groups according to random number table and inoculated with 0.2 ml, 0.1 ml and 0. 05 ml immune serum respectively via intraperitoneal injection on day 8,4 and 1 prior to challenged with 10 LD50 influenza virus intranasal. Mice were observed continually for 14 days to calculate the morbidity, mortality, average survival days and compare the lung index and viral titers in lung. Results Serum HI antibody titers of mice which inoculated with 0. 2 ml immune serum maintained 2 6 in 15 days after injection, but drawdown after day 17, the mice injected 1.5 ml immune serum were all alive and none onset. The survival rate of mice which injected 0. 2 ml serum on the day 8,4, 1 before challenge was 80%, 100% and 100%, and the average survival period was 13.1 days, 14.0 days and 14.0 days respectively. The survival rate of mice which injected 0. 1 ml and 0. 05 ml serum on day I before challenge A was 100% and 50% and the average survival days were 14.0 days and 11.7 days respectively. The mice A lung index of experimental groups (0.0096 +/- 0.0033 - 0.0145 +/- 0.0060) was smaller than that of viral A control group (0.0199 +/- 0.0025) with a statistical significance (P value 0.0022 - 0.0470, < 0. 05). The viral titers in lung were significantly decreased by 2 titer as compared to the viral controls. Conclusion The avian influenza virus immunized serum might contain the emergency prophylactic effects and could be developed as an agent for possible human-avian influenza pandemic.

The detection of anti-rabies antibodies in vampire bats indicates exposure to the rabies virus, and several studies have reported an increase of these antibodies following experimental infection. However, the dynamics of anti-rabies antibodies in natural populations of D. rotundus remains poorly understood. In this study, we took advantage of recent outbreaks of VBR among livestock in the Sao Paulo region of Brazil to test whether seroprevalence in D. rotundus reflects the incidence of rabies in nearby livestock populations. Sixty-four D. rotundus were captured during and after outbreaks from roost located in municipalities belonging to three regions with different incidences of rabies in herbivores. Sixteen seropositive bats were then kept in captivity for up to 120 days, and their antibodies and virus levels were quantified at different time points using the rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test (RFFIT). Antibody titers were associated with the occurrence of ongoing outbreak, with a higher proportion of bats showing titer >0.5 IU/ml in the region with a recent outbreak. However, low titers were still detected in bats from regions reporting the last outbreak of rabies at least 3 years prior to sampling. This study suggests that serological surveillance of rabies in vampire bats can be used as a tool to evaluate risk of outbreaks in at risk populations of cattle and human.

Genomic Profiling of Collaborative Cross Founder Mice Infected with Respiratory Viruses Reveals Novel Transcripts and Infection-Related Strain-Specific Gene and Isoform Expression								G3-GENES GENOMES GENETICS				4	8			1429	1444		10.1534/g3.114.011759				AUG 1 2014	2014	Genetic variation between diverse mouse species is well-characterized, yet existing knowledge of the mouse transcriptome comes largely from one mouse strain (C57BL/6J). As such, it is unlikely to reflect the transcriptional complexity of the mouse species. Gene transcription is dynamic and condition-specific; therefore, to better understand the mouse transcriptional response to respiratory virus infection, we infected the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross with either influenza A virus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and sequenced lung RNA samples at 2 and 4 days after infection. We found numerous instances of transcripts that were not present in the C57BL/6J reference annotation, indicating that a nontrivial proportion of the mouse genome is transcribed but poorly annotated. Of these novel transcripts, 2150 could be aligned to human or rat genomes, but not to existing mouse genomes, suggesting functionally conserved sequences not yet recorded in mouse genomes. We also found that respiratory virus infection induced differential expression of 4287 splicing junctions, resulting in strain-specific isoform expression. Of these, 59 were influenced by strain-specific mutations within 2 base pairs of key intron-exon boundaries, suggesting cis-regulated expression. Our results reveal the complexity of the transcriptional response to viral infection, previously undocumented genomic elements, and extensive diversity in the response across mouse strains. These findings identify hitherto unexplored transcriptional patterns and undocumented transcripts in genetically diverse mice. Host genetic variation drives the complexity and diversity of the host response by eliciting starkly different transcriptional profiles in response to a viral infection.

Assessing Zika virus replication and the development of Zika-specific antibodies after a mid-gestation viral challenge in guinea pigs								PLOS ONE				12	11					e0187720	10.1371/journal.pone.0187720				NOV 3 2017	2017	Primary Zika virus (ZIKV) infections that occur during pregnancy can cause spontaneous abortion and profoundly disrupt fetal development. While the full range of developmental abnormalities associated with congenital Zika syndrome is not yet known, severe cases of the syndrome can present with microcephaly, extensive neurologic and ocular damage, and pronounced joint malformations. Animal models that accurately recapitulate congenital Zika syndrome are urgently needed for vaccine development and for the study of ZIKV pathogenesis. As guinea pigs have successfully been used to model transplacental infections by cytomegalovirus, syphilis, and Listeria monocytogenes, we sought to test whether ZIKV could productively infect guinea pigs and whether viral transmission with attendant fetal pathology would occur after a mid-gestation viral challenge. We found that guinea pig cells supported ZIKV replication in vitro. Experimental infection of non-pregnant animals did not result in overt disease but low-level, detectable viremia was observed. When pregnant guinea pigs were challenged with ZIKV at between 18 and 21 days gestational age, ZIKV was not detected in maternal or pup blood, plasma, or tissues and no significant differences in maternal weight gain or pup size were observed following challenge. Nonetheless, a robust antibody response against ZIKV was detected in both the pups and dams. These results suggest that, while guinea pigs can model aspects of the immune response to ZIKV infection during pregnancy, naturally circulating ZIKV strains are not pathogenic during the pregnancy of immunocompetent guinea pigs and do not interfere with normal pup development.

However, low titers were still detected in bats from regions reporting the last outbreak of rabies at least 3 years prior to sampling. This study suggests that serological surveillance of rabies in vampire bats can be used as a tool to evaluate risk of outbreaks in at risk populations of cattle and human.

However, there have been few systematic animal experiments demonstrating the virus distribution after H7N9 virus infection. The present study was carried out to investigate the viral distribution and pathological changes in the main organs of mice after experimental infection with highly pathogenic H7N9 virus. Methods Infection of mice with A/Guangdong/GZ8H002/2017(H7N9) virus was achieved via nasal inoculation. Mice were killed at 2, 3, and 7 days post infection. The other mice were used to observe their illness status and weight changes. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and viral isolation were used to analyse the characteristics of viral invasion. The pathological changes of the main organs were observed using haematoxylin and eosin staining and immunohistochemistry. Results The weight of H7N9 virus-infected mice increased slightly in the first two days. However, the weight of the mice decreased sharply in the following days, by up to 20%. All the mice had died by the 8th day post infection and showed multiple organ injury. The emergence of viremia in mice was synchronous with lung infection. On the third day post infection, except in the brain, the virus could be isolated from all organs (lung, heart, kidney, liver, and spleen). On the seventh day post infection, the virus could be detected in all six organs. Brain infection was detected in all mice, and the viral titre in the heart, kidney, and spleen infection was high. Conclusion Acute diffuse lung injury was the initial pathogenesis in highly pathogenic H7N9 virus infection. In addition to lung infection and viremia, the highly pathogenic H7N9 virus could cause multiple organ infection and injury.																					WOS:000723653200003	34844617

Infection was confirmed by positive antibody titre to RSV after 6 weeks, and by typical pathological changes of bronchiolitis after I week in six animals from each group, Airway hyperresponsiveness was measured weekly for 5 weeks by histamine challenge, using body-plethysmographic measurement of compressed air (CA), The provocative concentration of histamine producing significant airway obstruction (i.e. CA = 0.1 mL) (PC0.1 mL CA in mg . mL(-1)) was calculated from dose-response curves, Six weeks postinfection, the lungs were investigated for the presence of inflammation and of viral antigen by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry using a rabbit hyperimmune serum and monoclonal antibodies.Airway responsiveness was increased in the RSV group 1 week postinfection compared to the control group (PC0.1 mt CA median 2.50 vs >10 mg . mL(-1); p<0.001) and this persisted up to 5 weeks postinfection (PC0.1 mt CA median 1.61 vs >10 mg . mL(-1); p<0.001). During the same period, viral antigen persisted in the lungs of infected animals, although there was less inflammation at 6 weeks postinfection than at 1 week postinfection,In guinea-pigs, respiratory syncytial virus infection of the airways causes persistent airway hyperresponsiveness over a period of at least 5 weeks, During this time, viral antigen, but not inflammation, remains detectable in the lungs and might be responsible for ongoing airway hyperresponsiveness.

Although human leukocytes could be isolated from the spleen of mock-infected mice during the 2-weeks experiment, the proportion of engrafted human leukocytes in mice infected with MV (10(3)-10(5) pfu) or rMV-E1E2 (10(4) pfu) was decreased. Viral infection of the splenocytes was confirmed by the development of cytopathic effects (CPEs) in co-cultures of splenocytes and B95a cells and verified using RT-PCR. Finally, human antibodies againstMVwere more frequently observed than E2-specific antibodies in serum from mice infected with a low dose of virus (MV, 10(0)-10(1) pfu, and rMV-E1E2, 10(1)-10(2) pfu). These results showed the possibility of hu-PBL-NOJ mice for the evaluation of the immunogenicity of viral proteins. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Fecal Influenza in Mammals: Selection of Novel Variants								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	21			11476	11486		10.1128/JVI.01544-13				NOV 2013	2013	In aquatic birds, influenza A viruses mainly replicate in the intestinal tract without significantly affecting the health of the host, but in mammals, they replicate in the respiratory tract and often cause disease. Occasionally, influenza viruses have been detected in stool samples of hospitalized patients and in rectal swabs of naturally or experimentally infected mammals. In this study, we compared the biological and molecular differences among four wild-type avian H1N1 influenza viruses and their corresponding fecal and lung isolates in DBA/2J and BALB/cJ mice. All fecal and lung isolates were more pathogenic than the original wild-type viruses, when inoculated into mice of both strains. The increased virulence was associated with the acquisition of genetic mutations. Most of the novel genotypes emerged as PB2(E627K), HA(F128V), HA(F454L), or HA(H300P) variations, and double mutations frequently occurred in the same isolate. However, influenza virus strain-and host-specific differences were also observed in terms of selected variants. The avian H1N1 virus of shorebird origin appeared to be unique in its ability to rapidly adapt to BALB/cJ mice via the fecal route, compared to the adaptability of the H1N1 virus of mallard origin. Furthermore, a bimodal distribution in fecal shedding was observed in mice infected with the fecal isolates, while a normal distribution was observed after infection with the lung isolates or wild-type virus. Fecal isolates contained HA mutations that increased the activation pH of the HA protein. We conclude that influenza virus variants that emerge in fecal isolates in mammals might influence viral transmission, adaptation to mammals, and viral ecology or evolution.

J	Butz, N; Ossent, P; Homberger, FR								Pathogenesis of guinea pig adenovirus infection								LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE				49	6			600	604						DEC 1999	1999	Background and Purpose: The existence of guinea pig adenovirus (GPAdV) has been suspected on the basis of histopathologic findings, but the virus has not yet been isolated, In susceptible animals, it may cause severe bronchopneumonia and death. Adenovirus-like inclusion bodies have been observed in the lungs of animals with clinical disease, Prevalence of the infection is unknown. Recently, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was described that was able to selectively detect GPAdV,Methods: To investigate the pathogenesis of GPAdV, we inoculated eight guinea pigs with GPAdV; eight control animals were sham inoculated. The PCR assay was used to trace the infection. In a second experiment, transmission of GPAdV from an experimentally infected animal to five immune-naive cohorts was examined,Results: None of the infected animals developed clinical disease. The GPAdV could be detected by PCR analysis of nasal-swab specimens on days 6 through 15 after infection. Infective virus could be recovered from the nasal mucose during this period (as determined by inoculation of immune-naive animals). The virus was transmitted from an experimentally infected animal to two of five immune-naive cage mates.Conclusion: The GPAdV may cause transient subclinical upper respiratory tract infection that may descend to the lungs.

We highlight cycluridine, an originally synthesized Mannich's base [a tetrahydro-2(1H)-pyrimidinones derivative], as a highly effective antiviral possessing a strong inhibitory effect on bovine viral diarrhoea virus replication. Cycluridine was active against replication of a wide variety of bovine viral diarrhoea virus strains in cell cultures. The drug-sensitive period in the bovine viral diarrhoea virus replication cycle included the latent period and the exponential phase; a 90-min delay in the peak of viral RNA synthesis was observed. Cycluridine administered orally manifested a pronounced protective effect in calves with natural mucosal disease/viral diarrhoea and calves experimentally infected with bovine viral diarrhoea virus. Its magnitude of activity and selectivity places cycluridine in the lead among all known substances with anti- bovine viral diarrhoea virus activity. Additionally, cycluridine applied subcutaneously showed anti-tick-born encephalitis virus activity, manifesting a marked protective effect in mice infected with tick-born encephalitis virus. Cycluridine could be a prospective antiviral in veterinary and medical practice for the treatment of bovine viral diarrhoea virus and other flavivirus infections.

The rabbit can be used for virus neutralization tests if the intradermal route of infection is used but is less suitable, because of lower susceptibility, than the sheep for virus detection. Partial resistance, for about 50 days, follows recovery from the experimental disease. Guinea pigs and mice are not suscept-ible by the routes used in the rabbit.

Compare the degree of pathogenicity of newly emerging influenza virus strains with pandemic potential by experimental infection of BALB/c mice with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus and mouse adapted pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Materials and methods. The first group of BALB/c mice (n=24) were infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus in a dose of 5 LD50, and the second group (n=24) were infected with mouse adapted pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus at a dose of 5 LD50. Determination of LD50 and TCID50 were performed by virological methods. Morphological changes in internal organs (lung, brain, liver, kidney, spleen) were examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. Results. Virologic analysis showed that both strains are highly lethal for mice. Microscopic examination revealed the development of interstitial pneumonia in the lungs and generalization of infection in the internal organs. Conclusion. In both groups of BALB/c mice experimentally infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) and mouse adapted pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus were revealed the development of a highly lethal disease in the form of respiratory pneumonia. It is noted, different mechanisms of pathological process: in case of infection with mouse adapted pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus firstly developed bronchitis, which quickly exacerbated by the development of alveolitis, while in case of infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) immediately developed alveolitis. On the 6th day after infection recorded the development of generalized infection in mice of both experimental groups.																					BCI:BCI201800557877

The present study was conducted to better understand the effects of GB on immune responses in a mouse model, and to demonstrate the clearance effects of this mineral against Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in experimentally infected pigs as an initial step towards the development of a feed supplement that would promote immune activity and help prevent diseases. In the mouse model, dietary supplementation with GB enhanced concanavalin A (ConA)-induced lymphocyte proliferation and increased the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. In pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV, viral titers in lungs and lymphoid tissues from the GB-fed group were significantly decreased compared to those of the control group 12 days post-infection. Corresponding histopathological analyses demonstrated that GB-fed pigs displayed less severe pathological changes associated with PRRSV infection compared to the control group, indicating that GB promotes PRRSV clearance. These antiviral effects in pigs may be related to the ability of GB to increase CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte production observed in the mice. Hence, this mineral may be an effective feed supplement for increasing immune activity and preventing disease.																					WOS:000321025200004	23814470

Dynamic Viral Dissemination in Mice Infected with Yellow Fever Virus Strain 17D								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	22			12392	12397		10.1128/JVI.02149-13				NOV 2013	2013	Arboviruses such as yellow fever virus (YFV) are transmitted between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts. While barriers limiting arbovirus population diversity have been observed in mosquitoes, whether barriers exist in vertebrate hosts is unclear. To investigate whether arboviruses encounter bottlenecks during dissemination in the vertebrate host, we infected immunocompetent mice and immune-deficient mice lacking alpha/beta interferon (IFN-alpha/beta) receptors (IFNAR(-/-) mice) with a pool of genetically marked viruses to evaluate dissemination and host barriers. We used the live attenuated vaccine strain YFV-17D, which contains many mutations compared with virulent YFV. We found that intramuscularly injected immunocompetent mice did not develop disease and that viral dissemination was restricted. Conversely, 32% of intramuscularly injected IFNAR(-/-) mice developed disease. By following the genetically marked viruses over time, we found broad dissemination in IFNAR(-/-) mice followed by clearance. The patterns of viral dissemination were similar in mice that developed disease and mice that did not develop disease. Unlike our previous results with poliovirus, these results suggest that YFV-17D encounters no major barriers during dissemination within a vertebrate host in the absence of the type I IFN response.

However, mammals may occasionally contract influenza A virus infections from this pool. This article summarizes: (i) natural infections in mammals including pigs, horses, marine mammals, ferrets, minks; (ii) results from experimental infections in several animal models including mice, ferrets, primates, rats, minks, hamsters and (iii) evidence for the increased pathogenicity of the current influenza A H5N1/Asia viruses for mammals. Several reports have shown that a number of mammalian species, including pigs, cats, ferrets, minks, whales, seals and finally also man are susceptible to natural infection with influenza A viruses of purely avian genetic make up. Among the mammalian species naturally susceptible to avian influenza virus the pig and the cat might exert the greatest potential public health impact. Despite numerous studies in animal and cell culture models, the basis of the extended host spectrum and the unusual pathogenicity of the influenza A H5N1 viruses for mammals is only beginning to be unraveled. Recently, also the transmission of equine influenza A virus to greyhound racing dogs has been documented.																					WOS:000236047900005	16573202

Chinese Journal of Veterinary Science				36	5			728	733						2016	2016	An indirect ELISA for detecting antibody against enterovirus E was established using the purified recombinant VP2 protein from enterovirus HY12 isolates as antigen, and employed to determine the antibody change in mice experimentally infected with enterovirus HY12. The optimal condition for antigen-coating is 300 ng/100 L with an incubation at 37°C for 60 min, and blocking reagent is 5% nonfat milk with an incubation at 37°C for 60 min. Threshold defining positive and negative samples was determined statistically based on BEV-negative mice serum samples, and serum with D190≥0.10 is considered as BEV-positive sample. Compared with the virus neutralization test, indirect ELISA method had a high sensitivity and specificity. Statistical analysis also showed that the coefficients of variation for positive serum and negative serum within the sample plate were 3.8% and 5.2%, respectively, indicating a stability of the ELISA assay. Mice were chosen as animal model and infected with enterovirus HY12 to determine viral immunogenicity. Antibody titers were assayed using indirect ELISA. The antibody was detected as early as 7 dpi, then gradually increased and reached peak level 42 dpi before it decreased. The antibody change revealed in experimentally infected mice will lay a solid basis of future investigation on vaccine and immune mechanism for HY12 enteroviruses.

The initial dose was 1 cc. intradermally or 5 cc. subcutaneously, of standard virus emulsion, followed by doses of 25, 50, 100, 175 and 250 cc. subcutaneously at 10-day intervals. Bleedings may be made 10 days after the last injection and alternated thereafter with reinforcing 250-cc. doses of virus emulsion at 10-day intervals. The standard virus emulsion used for hyperimmunizing and serum testing was 2% of brain tissue from artificially infected guinea pigs or horses emulsified in Locke's solution. Serum is considered of satisfactory titer when 2 cc. injected intra-peritoneally protects a 300-400 gm. guinea pig against 0.2 cc. of standard virus emulsion injected intracranially. A therapeutic dose of 250 cc. for the horse, repeated if indicated, is provisionally recommended. Berkefeld filtration of the serum reduced its potency. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: E.

Coxsackie B4 virus is strongly associated with the development of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in humans and shares sequence similarity with the islet autoantigen glutamic acid decarboxylase. We infected different strains of mice with Coxsackie B4 virus to discriminate between the two possible induction mechanisms, and found that mice with susceptible MHC alleles had no viral acceleration of diabetes, but mice with a T cell receptor transgene specific for a different islet autoantigen rapidly developed diabetes. These results show that diabetes induced by Coxsackie virus infection is a direct result of local infection leading to inflammation, tissue damage, and the release of sequestered islet antigen resulting in the re-stimulation of resting autoreactive T cells, further indicating that the islet antigen sensitization is an indirect consequence of the viral infection.

Lesions of meningoencephalomyelitis were found; but no such lesions were noted in cases clinically resembling louping-ill, but from which no virus was obtained. Sheep infected experimentally with the virus showed lesions similar to those in spontaneous cases. Destruction of the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum in sheep was constantly encountered, and severe damage to nerve cells of the medulla and all parts of the spinal cord often occurred, in both spontaneous and experimental cases. Specific inclusion bodies were not demonstrated in the nervous tissues. Intracellular bodies of a nonspecific nature were found in the large nerve cells of the spinal ganglia. Tissues of pigs and mice were not examined for inclusion bodies. In pigs the nervous tissues showed very intense cellular infiltration and relatively little nerve-cell destruction. In mice the principal lesion was necrosis of most of the large nerve cells of medulla and cord.																					BCI:BCI19340800013762

Embryo transfer rederivation of C.B-17/Icr-Prkdc(scid) mice experimentally infected with mouse parvovirus 1								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				58	4			353	359						AUG 2008	2008	We determined whether embryos derived from C.B-17/Icr-Prkdc(scid) (SCID) mice infected with mouse parvovirus (MPV) 1b and mated to MPV-naive B6C3F1 mice would transmit virus to naive recipient female mice and rederived progeny. Viral DNA was detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in lymphoid tissues, gonad, sperm, and feces of all MPV1b-inoculated SCID mice. Viral DNA was detected in 1 of 1.6 aliquots of embryos from infected male SCID mice and in 12 of 18 aliquots of embryos from infected female SCID mice. All recipient female mice implanted with embryos from infected SCID male mice and their progeny were negative by serology and qPCR. In contrast, 3 of 5 recipient female mice implanted with embryos from infected SCID female mice and 1.4 of 15 progeny mice from these recipients were seropositive by multiplex fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) for MPV capsid antigen (rVP2). All of these mice were negative by MFI for parvovirus nonstructural protein antigen (rNS1.) and by qPCR, with the exception of 1 recipient female mouse that displayed weak rNS1 seroreactivity and low levels of MPV DNA in lymphoid tissues. Seroreactivity to rVP2 declined over time in all progeny mice from infected SCID female mice until all were seronegative by 20 wk of age, consistent with maternal antibody transfer. Given that the high levels of MPV contamination detected in our experimentally infected SCID mice are unlikely in naturally infected immunocompetent mice, these data indicate that embryo transfer rederivation is effective for the eradication of MPV from infected colonies.

The Journal of the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases				73	2			122	9						1999-Feb	1999	This paper investigated the efficacy of passive protection provided by milk (immunized milk) against enterovirus infection in mice experimentally infected with enterovirus. Milk with a high antibody titer against six enterovirus serotypes was prepared from hyperimmunized goat. In vivo and in vitro experiments were performed and the results showed that immunized milk has an antiviral activity against enterovirus infection. Further observation was performed using Coxsackie B 3 virus (CVB 3). When immunized milk was orally applied to mice prior to oral inoculation with CVB 3, preventive effects against viral infection such as reduction of histopathological changes in the heart and reduced detection of the virus genome in the organs were seen. The antiviral effect was also indicated by the increase of CD4+T cells proportion in the i-IEL. The proportion of virus specific CD4+T cells was increased in mice treated with immunized milk, whereas no such increase was detected in control mice. These results suggest that oral application of immunized milk is not only capable of preventing viral infection but also induces specific immunological responses. These phenomena may play an important role in host defense mechanisms.																					MEDLINE:10213988	10213988

Experimental toxoplasmosis characterization and interpretation of visceral lesions				Tipologia ed interpretazione delle lesioni viscerali nella toxoplasmosi sperimentale				GIORN MAL INFETT E PARASSIT				11	(3)			165	189						1959	1959	Detailed anatomic and histologic investigations were made on experimentally infected guinea pigs, mice and rabbits, and on the chorion-allantois membrane of infected chick embryos. The disease appears to affect the majority of organs, but shows a preference for those rich in vascular components and sinusoidal or lacunar circulation. The lesions are essentially vascular with penetration of the parasite into endothelial elements. However, cells of all types may be actively penetrated by the parasite, an observation which contradicts the "phagocitic" theory of this infection. The lesions may be regressively cytolytic or necrobiotic or, conversely proliferative and metaplastic. The former are usually found during early stages of infection. In addition there are many secondary changes which vary with the experimental conditions and methods of infection. Many analogies are also found between toxoplasmosis and viral or rickettsial infections. Toxoplasmosis shows a different clinical course in various animal species; determining factors appear to be differences in natural resistance and in inherited and acquired sensitivity. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: MDS																					BCI:BCI19603500014444

All GP-positive and CP-negative cell types analyzed contained VP40 antigen and both GP and VP40 RNAs.Conclusions.-Ebola virus GP appears to selectively accumulate in many cell types infected in vivo, but not in macrophages and monocytes. This finding suggests that many cell types may have a GP-processing pathway that differs from the pathway described by previous in vitro studies. Differential cellular localization of CP could be relevant to the pathogenesis of Ebola hemorrhagic fever.																					WOS:000168488700007	11300932

Common respiratory strains of influenza virus are selectively toxic to dopaminergic neurons in culture.								Society for Neuroscience Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner				2003				Abstract No. 774.12	Abstract No. 774.12						2003	2003	Influenza virus (InV) infection during pregnancy increases schizoprenia in the offspring. Experimental infection of pregnant mice causes changes in the brain of offspring that resemble those observed in schizophrenia. The relationship between InV infection and the pathophysiology of schizophrenic symptoms is unknown. Inoculation of neurovirulent InV strains in rodents brain results in accumulation of virus in dopaminergic neurons (Dn). A similar preference for Dn occurs in vitro. The susceptibility of neuronal phenotypes to common respiratory influenza strains has not been described. We used two common isolates from the community (A/Sydney/5/97 (H3N2) and A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1) to inoculate primary cultures of rat mesencephalon (50 ml/well, HA titer 1:128), and examined the presence of infected cells 24, 48 or 72 h later. Both strains resulted in labelling of neurons and glia, but H1N1 strain resulted in significantly more neurons and dendrites infected, including prominent labelling of Dn. Figure shows cultures infected with H1N1 (top) or H3N3 (bottom), labelled with evans blue (red) for viability, fixed, stained with anti-HA (green) for viral antigen, and tyrosine hydroxylase for Dn (black, right panels). Infection with H1N1, but not with H3N3, resulted in significant selective toxicity to Dn after 48h, but not 24h.					33rd Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience33rd Annual Meeting of the Society of Neuroscience	November 08-12, 2003November 08-12, 2003	Society of NeuroscienceSociety of Neuroscience	New Orleans, LA, USANew Orleans, LA, USA													BCI:BCI200400145675		
J	Smreczak, Marcin; Orlowska, Anna								SARS-CoV-2 in animals: Natural and experimental infections								MEDYCYNA WETERYNARYJNA-VETERINARY MEDICINE-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE				77	4			167	175		10.21521/mw.6520				APR 2021	2021	COVID 19 is the first pandemic of the 21st century caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus belonging to the Coranaviridae family. The current pandemic has caused an enormous public health threat leading to the death of thousands of infected people. Reports of positive SARS-CoV-2 results in domestic, farmed and wildlife animals have led to concern among animal owners that animals could spread the virus to humans. The aim of this paper is to summarize information on natural and experimental infections with SARS-CoV-2 in animals. The virus can cross the species barrier, but it is usually transmitted from humans to animals. There is no unquestionable evidence of virus transmission between different animal species or from animals to humans. Experimental studies on the susceptibility of particular animal species to SARS-CoV-2 infection have so far shown different degrees of susceptibility to infection in cats, dogs, ferrets, hamsters, fruit bats, raccoon dogs, and primates. Pigs and poultry, on the other hand, were resistant to infection. There is still a great need to improve the knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals, the associated risks and the potential role of animals in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

This dichotomy has equally shown the complexity of immune responses since there is a well orchestrated cross-regulation of cytokine production induced by viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens. In the context of type1-type 2 cytokine pattern, mice has been universally and extensively used to associate an infectious disease according to each category in order to better understand human infections. However, with respect to schistosomiasis, immunological observations in mice have not been confirmed in humans and particularly the nature of the protective immune response. This report will consider the relevance of extrapolating from immunological studies on schistosome in experimentally infected rats to studies on naturally infected humans.

Two somatic compounds - S and HB and one exoantigen E, obtained from a standard strain of M. canis No V85/28 were used as target antigens.Sera for the study were collected from guinea pigs and cats experimentally infected with M. canis or vaccinated against M. canis infection.Goat sera labelled by horse-radish peroxidase was used as conjugates in this system. On the basis of statistical analysis NUNC micrometre plates and the somatic HB antigen were assessed as being most useful.It was found that M. canis infection elicited a humoral immune response in guinea pigs and cats and that its level corresponded with the time span after infection (the highest concentration of antibodies being at 4 months). The relatively early occurrence of specific antibodies in the sera of infected cats may be important for the diagnostic process. The course of the disease (intensity of clinical changes) and the age of animals did not influence the level of antibodies.The ELISA test also revealed that the postvaccinal humoral response lasted through to the end of the study, i.e. 3 months and 5 months in guinea pigs and cats, respectively. The immune response in cats (two infected and one vaccinated) bearing the signs of simultaneous viral infection was depressed most probably due to the Immune-suppressive effect of the virus.

There are numerous CSFV strains that differ in virulence, resulting in clinical disease with different degrees of severity. Low-virulent and moderately virulent isolates cause a mild and often chronic disease, while highly virulent isolates cause an acute and mostly lethal hemorrhagic fever. The live attenuated vaccine strain GPE(-) was produced by multiple passages of the virulent ALD strain in cells of swine, bovine, and guinea pig origin. With the aim of identifying the determinants responsible for the attenuation, the GPE- vaccine virus was readapted to pigs by serial passages of infected tonsil homogenates until prolonged viremia and typical signs of CSF were observed. The GPE(-)/P-11 virus isolated from the tonsils after the 11th passage in vivo had acquired 3 amino acid substitutions in E2 (T830A) and NS4B (V2475A and A2563V) compared with the virus before passages. Experimental infection of pigs with the mutants reconstructed by reverse genetics confirmed that these amino acid substitutions were responsible for the acquisition of pathogenicity. Studies in vitro indicated that the substitution in E2 influenced virus spreading and that the changes in NS4B enhanced the viral RNA replication. In conclusion, the present study identified residues in E2 and NS4B of CSFV that can act synergistically to influence virus replication efficiency in vitro and pathogenicity in pigs.

Bovine viral diarrhea viruses have been isolated from a number of cervids, including mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), and mouse deer (Tragulus javanicus), but little information is available regarding clinical presentation and progression of infection in these species. In preliminary studies of experimental infection of deer with BVDV, researchers noted seroconversion but no clinical signs. In this study, we infected white-tailed deer fawns that were negative for BVDV and for antibodies against BVDV, with either a type I or a type 2 BVDV that had been isolated from white-tailed deer. Fawns were monitored for changes in basal temperature, circulating lymphocytes, and platelets. The clinical progression following inoculation in these fawns was similar to that seen with BVDV infections in cattle and included fever and depletion of circulating lymphocytes. Because free-ranging cervid populations are frequently in contact with domestic cattle in the United States, possible transfer of BVDV between cattle and cervids has significant implications for proposed BVDV control programs.

Murine astrovirus (MuAstV) is frequently detected in laboratory mice. Previous studies on MuAstV in mice did not report any symptoms or lesions. However, little information is available regarding its pathogenicity in immunodeficient mice. Therefore, in this study, we experimentally infected germ-free NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)//2rg(tm1Sug)/ShiJic (NOG) mice, which are severely immunodeficient, with MuAstV. Germ-free mice were used for experimental infection to eliminate the effects of intestinal bacteria. Mice in each group were then necropsied and subjected to PCR for MuAstV detection, MuAstV RNA quantification in each organ, and histopathological examination at 4 and 28 days post inoculation (DPI). Tissue samples from the small intestine were examined by transmission electron microscopy. No symptoms or abnormalities were detected in any mice during necropsy. The MuAstV concentration was highest in the lower small intestine, where it increased approximately 8-fold from 4 to 28 DPI. Transmission electron microscopy revealed circular virus particles of approximately 25 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm of the villous epithelial cells of the lower small intestine. Histopathological examination did not reveal any abnormalities, such as atrophy, in the intestinal villi. Our results suggest that MuAstV proliferates in the villous epithelial cells of the lower small intestine and has weak pathogenicity.																					WOS:000717618300001	33828018

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with spike (S) glycoproteins conferring binding to the host cell's angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is critical for cellular entry. The host range of the virus extends well beyond humans and non-human primates. Natural and experimental infections have confirmed the high susceptibility of cats, ferrets, and Syrian hamsters, whereas dogs, mice, rats, pigs, and chickens are refractory to SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate the underlying reason for the variable susceptibility observed in different species, we have developed molecular descriptors to efficiently analyse dynamic simulation models of complexes between SARS-CoV-2 S and ACE2. Our extensive analyses represent the first systematic structure-based approach that allows predictions of species susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The pathogenesis caused by these viruses in their respective host species is currently insufficiently understood, which is primarily due to the inability to obtain and keep these bat species under appropriate environmental and biosafety conditions. Seba's short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata), in contrast, are close relatives and a natural H18N11 reservoir species, with the advantage of established animal husbandry conditions in academic research. To study viral pathogenesis in more detail, we here oro-nasally inoculated Seba's short-tailed bats with the bat IAV H18N11 subtype. Following inoculation, bats appeared clinically healthy, but the histologic examination of tissues revealed a mild necrotizing rhinitis. Consistently, IAV-matrix protein and H18-RNA positive cells were seen in lesioned respiratory and olfactory nasal epithelia, as well as in intestinal tissues. A RT-qPCR analysis confirmed viral replication in the conchae and intestines as well as the presence of viral RNA in the excreted feces, without horizontal transmission to naive contact animals. Moreover, all inoculated animals seroconverted with low titers of neutralizing antibodies.																					WOS:000521256600083	32093076

To determine whether IFN-alpha/beta also modulates the virus-host interaction during latent virus infection, we infected mice lacking the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-alpha/beta R-/-) and wild-type (wt; 129S2/SvPas) mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gamma HV68), a lymphotropic gamma-2-herpesvirus that establishes latent infection in B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. 1FN-alpha/beta R-/- mice cleared low-dose intranasal gamma HV68 infection with wt kinetics and harbored essentially wt frequencies of latently infected cells in both peritoneum and spleen by 28 days postinfection. However, latent virus in peritoneal cells and splenocytes from IFN-alpha/beta R-/- mice reactivated ex vivo with >40-fold- and 5-fold-enhanced efficiency, respectively, compared to wt cells. Depletion of IFN-alpha/beta from wt mice during viral latency also significantly increased viral reactivation, demonstrating an antiviral function of IFN-alpha/beta during latency. Viral reactivation efficiency was temporally regulated in both wt and IFN-alpha/beta R(-/-)mice. The mechanism of IFN-alpha/beta R action was distinct from that of IFN-gamma R, since IFN-alpha/beta R-/- mice did not display persistent virus replication in vivo. Analysis of viral latent gene expression in vivo demonstrated specific upregulation of the latency-associated gene M2, which is required for efficient reactivation from latency, in IFN-alpha/beta R-/- splenocytes. These data demonstrate that an IFN-alpha/beta-induced pathway regulates gamma HV68 gene expression patterns during latent viral infection in vivo and that IFN-alpha/beta plays a critical role in inhibiting viral reactivation during latency.

Variations of the isoenzymatic structures of peroxidase and acid and alkaline phosphatases were studied too. The results revealed the significant reduction of mortality and of hemagglutinating titre and the augmentation of mean survival time. Modifications of the isoenzymatic structures, especially of the phosphatases, are characteristic for the illness state as well as for the one induced by R. niger extract treatment.

Borna-Virus-Infektion (Borna-Krankheit) bei naturlich und experimentell infizierten Tieren: ihre Bedeutung fur Forschung und Praxis.				Tierarztliche Praxis				13	4			421	53						1985	1985	In this survey article on Borna Disease-many years after the review of Zwick (1939)-again a modern comprehensive summary of "Borna Disease virus infection" is given. The infection occurs in horses and sheep, furthermore, in laboratory animal species inoculated experimentally; its clinical, virological and neuropathological features have been described in numerous presentations. Clinical symptoms in naturally and experimentally infected animals are characterized by initial alterations in the sensorium. The neurological symptomatology of the disease (disturbances in coordination, motor, sensory and vegetative symptoms) reflect the presumed localisation of the virus in various brain areas and the course of the disease supports the assumption of intraneural spread of the agent. In horses the incidence is highest during spring. Experimental infections show an exceptionally broad spectrum of infectible animals extending from higher mammals to birds. Our investigations make it clear that we have to differentiate between infections followed by disease (e.g. horse, rabbit, older rat) and persistent infections without overt clinical symptoms (mouse, chicken). Persistent infections are sometimes associated with fine alterations in behaviour (tree shrew) or decreased learning ability (mice). Borna Disease virus, which has not been characterized up to now, is known to grow without any cytopathic effect in tissue cultures. All tested cell lines (including those from man) could be infected. The investigations indicate that Borna Disease virus comprises an enveloped RNS-containing agent. The infection induces the production of specific antigens such as a complex known as the soluble antigen, and a 14500 dalton protein. Under natural conditions and in experimentally infected animals antibodies are produced against such soluble proteins and determinants involved in neutralization of the virus. In the central nervous system (CNS) a local immune response accompanied by the production of oligoclonal immunoglobulins is demonstrable. Besides the humoral reaction it was possible to study the influence of cellular defence mechanisms on the disease process in monkeys, rats and rabbits. Histopathologically, Borna Disease is characterized by a non-purulent inflammation of the brain and the spinal cord. Most alterations are found in the grey matter, mainly in the Ammon's horn, olfactory lobe, caudate nucleus, thalamus, lamina quadrigemina and in he cerebellar nuclei. The perivascular infiltrations, consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and plasma cells are most conspicuous. Occasionally, degenerative alterations are observed in ganglion cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)																					MEDLINE:3834641	3834641

Serologic assays are commonly used to diagnose MMV and MPV infections in laboratory mice; however, highly accurate, high-throughput serologic assays for the detection of MMV- and MPV-infected mice are needed. To this end, the major capsid viral protein (VP2) genes of MW and MPV were cloned and MW recombinant VP2 (rVP2) and MPV rVP2 proteins were expressed by using a baculovirus system. MMV rVP2 and MPV rVP2 spontaneously formed virus-like particles that were morphologically similar to empty parvovirus capsids. These proteins were used as antigens in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect anti-MMV or anti-MPV antibodies in the sera of infected mice. Sera from mice experimentally infected with MW (n = 43) or MPV (n = 35) and sera from uninfected mice (n = 30) were used to evaluate the ELISAs. The MMV ELISA was 100% sensitive and 100% specific in detecting MW-infected mice, and the MPV ELISA was 100% sensitive and 98.6% specific in detecting MPV-infected mice. Both assays outperformed a parvovirus ELISA that uses a recombinant nonstructural protein (NSI) of MW as antigen. The MW rVP2 and MPV rVP2 proteins provide a ready source of easily produced antigen, and the ELISAs developed provide highly accurate, high-throughput assays for the serodiagnosis of MMV and MPV infections in laboratory mice.

We demonstrate that a vaccine based on the extracellular domain (SHe) of the small hydrophobic (SH) protein of HRSV, reduced viral replication in challenged laboratory mice and in cotton rats. We show that this suppression of viral replication can be transferred by serum and depends on a functional IgG receptor compartment with a major contribution of FcRI and FcRIII. Using a conditional cell depletion method, we provide evidence that alveolar macrophages are involved in the protection by SHe-specific antibodies. HRSV-infected cells abundantly express SH on the cell surface and are likely the prime target of the humoral immune response elicited by SHe-based vaccination. Finally, natural infection of humans and experimental infection of mice or cotton rats does not induce a strong immune response against HRSV SHe. Using SHe as a vaccine antigen induces immune protection against HRSV by a mechanism that differs from the natural immune response and from other HRSV vaccination strategies explored to date. Hence, HRSV vaccine candidates that aim at inducing protective neutralizing antibodies or T-cell responses could be complemented with a SHe-based antigen to further improve immune protection.

Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene				29				317	354		10.1016/S0035-9203(36)90049-4				1936	1936	Rabies in Trinidad is of unusual type, in that almost all the human cases are paralytic [see this Bull. 1. 285, and 3. 699.]; the vampire bat (Desmodus rufus) is there the chief, if not the only, vector.Vampire bats, the sole mammals specialized to feed exclusively on blood, are readily maintained and bred in captivity, using defibrinated blood as food. The teeth are especially adapted for cutting, and the animal laps blood exuding from a wound inflicted on a warm-blooded animal, in the case of horses, cattle, etc., commonly on the shoulder or neck; the prolonged contact (15 to 25 minutes) must result in heavy contamination of the wound with saliva, which may explain the frequency of paralytic rabies after bites by infected bats. Other distinguishing features from cohabiting fish-, flesh- and fruit-eating bats are enumerated. The digesting and resting places of the bats in hollow trees, caves, drains, etc., are readily recognized by the animals' tarry excrement. Though normally nocturnal, infected bats often bite in the daytime; they may fly a mile or so to their victims.The first evidence that rabies exists among bats in a new locality is increased frequency of biting; animal mortality always precedes human, since men are less likely to be bitten until precautions have been taken to safeguard animals, or these have been largely destroyed. The disease tends to occur in epidemic form over periods of from one to ten weeks, and then to persist in endemic form for months or years; a subsequent period of freedom may be due to local self-extermination of bats.Negri bodies were detected in 9.4 per cent, of 566 Desmodus caught in " infected " areas. In " non-infected " areas, 1.9 per cent, of 210 brains were positive. Less commonly, fruit-eaters were found to be infected. The disease has been transmitted with brains of Desmodus bats to calves and a monkey, but never directly to dogs, and from Artibeus (fruit-eating) bats to a guineapig, a rabbit and a calf. Dogs may be infected with passage virus, when they always develop paralytic rabies. From Brazil it is reported that Desmodus bats, though showing no symptoms of rabies themselves, may transmit the disease to cattle within one to four months of experimental inoculation.Control measures at present in operation include a survey of Desmodus resting places, destruction of bats, protective inoculation and protection from bites, educational and propaganda work, and so on. Bats are best destroyed (1) by local application of strychnine to a wound, which serves the need of many bats night after night; (2) by netting or shooting when driven from their resting places by fumigation, and (3) by poisoning in their resting places with a cyanogas A dust.-E.

The virus was able to agglutinate the erythrocytes of most of the species tested although the HA titres varied; some of them such as that of the month-old ducklings reached 29. Verification by the haemagglutination inhibition test showed that these HA activities were all non-specific ones. The virus could also agglutinate the O-type human erythrocytes. The HA titres of various tissues of rabbits which had died of experimental infection were in the following order: liver>spleen>lung>kidney>heart muscle.																					CABI:19902204156

Pathologic findings in dogs spontaneously infected with canine influenza virus were compared with lesions induced in beagle and mongrel dogs following experimental inoculation with influenza A/canine/Florida/43/2004. BALB/c mice were inoculated with canine influenza virus to assess their suitability as an experimental model for viral pathogenesis studies. All dogs inoculated with virus developed necrotizing and hyperplastic tracheitis and bronchitis with involvement of submucosal glands as well as mild bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Viral antigen was identified in bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells of all dogs and in alveolar macrophages of several dogs. Many dogs that were spontaneously infected with virus also developed bacterial pneumonia, and greyhound dogs with fatal spontaneous infection developed severe pulmonary hemorrhage with hemothorax. Virus-inoculated BALB/c mice developed tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and mild pneumonia in association with viral antigen in airway epithelial cells and in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. Virus was not detected in extrarespiratory sites in any animals. The results indicate that canine influenza virus infection consistently induces acute tracheitis and bronchitis in dogs. Mice may be a useful model for some pathogenesis studies on canine influenza virus infection.																					WOS:000277480400012	20351357

In normal mice, this infection has two distinct consequences on specific V beta 6(+)CD4(+) T cells, consisting of activation followed by clonal deletion. MMTV (SW)-SAG-induced activation in vivo was identical in MRL-+/+ and MRL-1pr mice. In contrast, clonal deletion showed age-dependent impairment. Early infection (5 weeks) led to identical clonal deletion of specific T cells in blood lymphocytes from MRL-+/+ and MRL-1pr mice, although clonal deletion was slightly impaired in the MRL-lpr lymph nodes. Late infection (10 weeks) of MRL-lpr mice led to markedly delayed and reduced clonal deletion. V beta 6(+)CD4(+) T cells which escaped clonal deletion in aging MRL-lpr mice were not anergized by interaction with SAG. These results show that peripheral clonal deletion induced by viral SAG in adult mice is controlled by Fas, but not exclusively so.																					WOS:A1995RG46500006	7542196	
J	Richardson-Burns, SM; Tyler, KL								Minocycline delays disease onset and mortality in reovirus encephalitis								EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY				192	2			331	339		10.1016/j.expneurol.2004.11.015				APR 2005	2005	Minocycline is neuroprotective in many experimental models of neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system (CNS) injury but has not previously been tested in a model of viral encephalitis. Experimental infection of neonatal mice with neurotropic reoviruses is a classic model for studying the pathogenesis of viral encephalitis. Intracerebral inoculation of serotype 3 reovirus strain Dearing (T3D) in neonatal mice results in lethal encephalitis caused by neuronal apoptosis throughout the CNS. Minocycline significantly delayed death in mice to 11.6 +/- 0.9 days post-infection vs. 8.6 +/- 0.7 days post-infection in controls (P < 0.01). Virus-induced CNS injury, apoptosis, viral titer and antigen expression were significantly decreased in the brains of minocycline-treated mice on 6 and 8 days post-infection compared to controls. Virus-induced injury and viral titer in minocycline-treated infected mice at 11 days post-infection were similar to those seen in untreated T3D-infected mice at 8 days post-infection. Little microglial or astrocytic invasion of brain regions with viral injury was found at any time-point in untreated or minocycline-treated mice, suggesting that in this model system the neuroprotective effect exerted by minocycline is more likely due to its anti-apoptotic properties rather than its capacity to inhibit microglial activation and limit gliosis. These findings, similar to those reported for neurodegenerative diseases, indicate that minocycline does not prevent development of fatal reovirus encephalitis but delays disease onset and progression, suggesting that minocycline treatment may provide a useful adjunctive therapy in viral CNS infections.

Determining transmission routes of these viruses during an outbreak is essential for the control of avian influenza. It has been widely postulated that migratory ducks play crucial roles in the widespread dissemination of HPAIVs in poultry by carrying viruses along with their migrations; however close contacts between wild migratory ducks and poultry are less likely in modern industrial poultry farming settings. Therefore, we conducted experimental infections of HPAIVs and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses (LPAIVs) to chickens, domestic ducks, tree sparrows, jungle crows, and black rats to evaluate their roles in virus transmission. The results showed that chickens, ducks, sparrows, and crows were highly susceptible to HPAIV infection. Significant titers of virus were recovered from the sparrows and crows infected with HPAIVs, which suggests that they potentially play roles of transmission of HPAIVs to poultry. In contrast, the growth of LPAIVs was limited in each of the animals tested compared with that of HPAIVs. The present results indicate that these common synanthropes play some roles in influenza virus transmission from wild birds to poultry. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Replicons of a Rodent Hepatitis C Model Virus Permit Selection of Highly Permissive Cells								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	19					e00733-19	10.1128/JVI.00733-19				OCT 2019	2019	Animal hepaciviruses represent promising surrogate models for hepatitis C virus (HCV), for which there are no efficient immunocompetent animal models. Experimental infection of laboratory rats with rodent hepacivirus isolated from feral Rattus norvegicus (RHV-rn1) mirrors key aspects of HCV infection in humans, including chronicity, hepatitis, and steatosis. Moreover, RHV has been adapted to infect immunocompetent laboratory mice. RHV in vitro systems have not been developed but would enable detailed studies of the virus life cycle crucial for designing animal experiments to model HCV infection. Here, we established efficient RHV-rn1 selectable subgenomic replicons with and without reporter genes. Rat and mouse liver-derived cells did not readily support the complete RHV life cycle, but replicon-containing cell clones could be selected with and without acquired mutations. Replication was significantly enhanced by mutations in NS4B and NS5A and in cell clones cured of replicon RNA. These mutations increased RHV replication of both mono- and bicistronic constructs, and CpG/UpA-dinucleotide optimization of reporter genes allowed replication. Using the replicon system, we show that the RHV-rn1 NS3-4A protease cleaves a human mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein reporter, providing a sensitive readout for virus replication. RHV-rn1 replication was inhibited by the HCV polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir and high concentrations of HCV NSSA antivirals but not by NS3 protease inhibitors. The microRNA-122 antagonist miravirsen inhibited RHV-rn1 replication, demonstrating the importance of this HCV host factor for RHV. These novel RHV in vitro systems will be useful for studies of tropism, molecular virology, and characterization of virus-host interactions, thereby providing important complements to in vivo systems.IMPORTANCE A vaccine against hepatitis C virus (HCV) is crucial for global control of this important pathogen, which induces fatal human liver diseases. Vaccine development has been hampered by the lack of immunocompetent animal models. Discovery of rodent hepacivirus (RHV) enabled establishment of novel surrogate animal models. These allow robust infection and reverse genetic and immunization studies of laboratory animals, which develop HCV-like chronicity. Currently, there are no RHV in vitro systems available to study tropism and molecular virology. Here, we established the first culture systems for RHV, recapitulating the intracellular phase of the virus life cycle in vitro. These replicon systems enabled identification of replication-enhancing mutations and selection of cells highly permissive to RHV replication, which allow study of virus-host interactions. HCV antivirals targeting NS5A, NS5B, and microRNA-122 efficiently inhibited RHV replication. Hence, several important aspects of HCV replication are shared by the rodent virus system, reinforcing its utility as an HCV model.																					WOS:000485789300019	31292246

The test was effective in detecting viral antigens in model systems (saccharo-acetone antigens) and in brain suspensions and serum of experimentally infected newborn mice. The LIFA possessed several important advantage over the solid phase enzyme immunoassay, including higher sensitivity, the capacity to detect virus-specific antigens in material containing a wide range of viral antigen concentrations, and against a high background protein concentration (such as serum); the one-step LIFA was also more rapid.

It has been expected that human or humanized antibodies will be made available for the prophylaxis, pre-emptive and acute treatment of viral infection. However, it is still unclear whether anti-NP human antibody can confer protection against influenza virus infection. In this study, we generated transgenic mice expressing anti-NP human mAbs derived from lymphocytes of a patient infected with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, and experimental infections were conducted to examine antiviral effects of the anti-NP antibodies against H5N1 HPAI viral infections with a high fatality rate in mammals. Transgenic mouse lines expressing the anti-NP human mAbs at more than 1 mg ml(-1) showed marked resistance to H5N1 virus infections. In addition, resistance to infection with an H1N1 subtype that shows strong pathogenicity to mice was also confirmed. Although the anti-NP mAbs expressed in the transgenic mice did not neutralize the virus, the mAbs could bind to NP located on the surface of infected cells. These results suggested a possibility that the non-neutralizing anti-NP human mAbs could induce indirect antiviral effects, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity or complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Taken together, these results demonstrated that anti-NP human mAbs play an important role in heterosubtypic protection against lethal influenza virus infections in vivo.

Although TMEV is a mouse pathogen, antibodies against TMEV strain GDVII have been detected in conventional rat colonies. Natural infection of rats by Cardiovirus has not yet been described. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate TMEV infection of rat colonies by using serologic assays, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, and clinical characterization. Indirect immunofluorescence assay of rat serum samples demonstrated antibodies against TMEV-GDVII in 86.3% of samples analyzed, and 77.2% of the antibody-positive samples had neutralizing antibodies. To determine whether rats can be infected experimentally with TMEV-GDVII, specific pathogen-free newborn mice and rats were inoculated intracerebrally with intestinal suspensions from seropositive rats. Both species showed the typical clinical signs of TMEV infection in mice, which is characterized by flaccid hindlimb paralysis and tremor. RT-PCR in brain tissue of experimentally infected animals detected RNA sequences corresponding to the 5'-noncoding region of Cardiovirus known as the 'internal ribosome entry site.' These results suggest that rats can be naturally infected with TMEV and related Cardiovirus. Therefore, continued health monitoring for TMEV infection should be included in rat colonies mainly because these animals are used for various experimental purposes.

Each pathogenic hantavirus is naturally hosted by a principal rodent species without conspicuous disease and infection is persistent, perhaps for life. Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are the natural reservoirs of Sin Nombre virus (SNV), the etiologic agent of most HCPS cases in North America. Deer mice remain infected despite a helper T cell response that leads to high-titer neutralizing antibodies. Deer mice are also susceptible to Andes hantavirus (ANDV), which causes most HCPS cases in South America; however, deer mice clear ANDV. We infected deer mice with SNV or ANDV to identify differences in host responses that might account for this differential outcome. SNV RNA levels were higher in the lungs but not different in the heart, spleen, or kidneys. Most ANDV-infected deer mice had seroconverted 14 days after inoculation, but none of the SNV-infected deer mice had. Examination of lymph node cell antigen recall responses identified elevated immune gene expression in deer mice infected with ANDV and suggested maturation toward a Th2 or T follicular helper phenotype in some ANDV-infected deer mice, including activation of the interleukin 4 (IL-4) pathway in T cells and B cells. These data suggest that the rate of maturation of the immune response is substantially higher and of greater magnitude during ANDV infection, and these differences may account for clearance of ANDV and persistence of SNV.IMPORTANCEHantaviruses persistently infect their reservoir rodent hosts without pathology. It is unknown how these viruses evade sterilizing immune responses in the reservoirs. We have determined that infection of the deer mouse with its homologous hantavirus, Sin Nombre virus, results in low levels of immune gene expression in antigen-stimulated lymph node cells and a poor antibody response. However, infection of deer mice with a heterologous hantavirus, Andes virus, results in a robust lymph node cell response, signatures of T and B cell maturation, and production of antibodies. These findings suggest that an early and aggressive immune response to hantaviruses may lead to clearance in a reservoir host and suggest that a modest immune response may be a component of hantavirus ecology.

J	Ward, AC								Virulence of influenza A virus for mouse lung								VIRUS GENES				14	3			187	194		10.1023/A:1007979709403				1997	1997	The experimental infection of mouse lung with influenza A virus has proven to be an invaluable model for studying the mechanisms of viral adaptation and virulence. These investigations have identified critical roles for the haemagglutinin (HA) and matrix (M) genes of the virus in determining virulence for mouse lung. For the HA gene, the loss of glycosylation sites from the encoded polypeptide or changes which may affect the pH of HA-mediated endosome fusion have been observed following adaptation. These alterations also have the potential to impact on receptor specificity, beta inhibitor sensitivity and activation cleavage which may act in concert to account for the increased virulence of adapted strains. For the M gene, two specific changes in the M-1 protein have been identified in strains adapted to, or virulent for, mouse lung. These changes are likely to affect pH-dependent association/dissociation of M-1 with the viral ribonucleoprotein, and control virulence as well as growth. The role of other genes in mouse lung virulence remains unknown.																					WOS:A1997XW59200004	9311563

The major virus-producing cell type during murine cytomegalovirus infection, the hepatocyte, is not the source of virus dissemination in the host								CELL HOST & MICROBE				3	4			263	272		10.1016/j.chom.2008.02.014				APR 2008	2008	The course of systemic viral infections is determined by the virus productivity of infected cell types and the efficiency of virus dissemination throughout the host. Here, we used a cell-type-specific virus labeling system to quantitatively track virus progeny during murine cytomegalovirus infection. We infected mice that expressed Cre recombinase selectively in vascular endothelial cells or hepatocytes with a murine cytomegalovirus; for which Cre-mediated recombination would generate a fluorescently labeled virus. We showed that endothelial cells and hepatocytes produced virus after direct infection. However, in the liver, the main contributor to viral load in the mouse, most viruses were produced by directly infected hepatocytes. Remarkably, although virus produced in hepatocytes spread to hepatic endothelial cells (and vice versa), there was no significant spread from the liver to other organs. Thus, the cell type producing the most viruses was not necessarily the one responsible for virus dissemination within the host.																					WOS:000255326100010	18407069

They evolve by the process of antigenic drift that leads to substantial change in the antigenicity of the virus, thereby necessitating substitution of virus strain in the vaccines. This requires frequent testing of the new vaccines in the in vivo system; however, lack of an appropriate laboratory animal challenge model for testing protective efficacy of equine influenza vaccine candidates hinders the screening of new vaccines and other therapeutic approaches. In the present investigation, BALB/c mouse were explored for suitability for conducting pathogenecity studies for EIV. The BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally @ 2x10(6.24) EID50 with EIV (H3N8) belonging to Clade 2 of Florida sublineage and monitored for setting up of infection and associated parameters. All mice inoculated with EIV exhibited clinical signs viz. loss in body weights, lethargy, dyspnea, etc, between 3 and 5 days which commensurate with lesions observed in the respiratory tract including rhinitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, alveolitis and diffuse interstitial pneumonia. Transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, virus quantification through titration and qRT-PCR demonstrated active viral infection in the upper and lower respiratory tract. Serology revealed rise in serum lactate dehydrogenase levels along with sero-conversion. The pattern of disease progression, pathological lesions and virus recovery from nasal washings and lungs in the present investigations in mice were comparable to natural and experimental EIV infection in equines. The findings establish BALB/c mice as small animal model for studying EIV (H3N8) infection and will have immense potential for dissecting viral pathogenesis, vaccine efficacy studies, preliminary screening of vaccine candidates and antiviral therapeutics against EIV.

Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated is required for the development of protective immune memory after influenza A virus infection								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY				317	5			L591	L601		10.1152/ajplung.00031.2019				NOV 2019	2019	Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), caused by mutations in the A-T mutated (ATM) gene, is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting similar to 1 in 40,000-100,000 children. Recurrent respiratory infections are a common and challenging comorbidity, often leading to the development of bronchiectasis in individuals with A-T. The role of ATM in development of immune memory in response to recurrent respiratory viral infections is not well understood. Here, we infect wild-type (WT) and Atm-null mice with influenza A virus (IAV; HKx31, H3N2) and interrogate the immune memory with secondary infections designed to challenge the B cell memory response with homologous infection (HKx31) and the T cell memory response with heterologous infection (PR8, H1N1). Although Atm-null mice survived primary and secondary infections, they lost more weight than WT mice during secondary infections. This enhanced morbidity to secondary infections was not attributed to failure to effectively clear virus during the primary IAV infection. Instead, Atm-null mice developed persistent peribronchial inflammation, characterized in part by clusters of B220(+) B cells. Additionally, levels of select serum antibodies to hemagglutinin-specific IAV were significantly lower in Atm-null than WT mice. These findings reveal that Atm is required to mount a proper memory response to a primary IAV infection, implying that vaccination of children with A-T by itself may not be sufficiently protective against respiratory viral infections.

Influenza Viruses in Mice: Deep Sequencing Analysis of Serial Passage and Effects of Sialic Acid Structural Variation								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	23					e01039-19	10.1128/JVI.01039-19				DEC 2019	2019	Influenza A viruses have regularly jumped to new host species to cause epidemics or pandemics, an evolutionary process that involves variation in the viral traits necessary to overcome host barriers and facilitate transmission. Mice are not a natural host for influenza virus but are frequently used as models in studies of pathogenesis, often after multiple passages to achieve higher viral titers that result in clinical disease such as weight loss or death. Here, we examine the processes of influenza A virus infection and evolution in mice by comparing single nucleotide variations of a human H1N1 pandemic virus, a seasonal H3N2 virus, and an H3N2 canine influenza virus during experimental passage. We also compared replication and sequence variation in wild-type mice expressing N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) with those seen in mice expressing only N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac). Viruses derived from plasmids were propagated in MDCK cells and then passaged in mice up to four times. Full-genome deep sequencing of the plasmids, cultured viruses, and viruses from mice at various passages revealed only small numbers of mutational changes. The H3N2 canine influenza virus showed increases in frequency of sporadic mutations in the PB2, PA, and NA segments. The H1N1 pandemic virus grew well in mice, and while it exhibited the maintenance of some minority mutations, there was no clear evidence for adaptive evolution. The H3N2 seasonal virus did not establish in the mice. Finally, there were no clear sequence differences associated with the presence or absence of Neu5Gc.IMPORTANCE Mice are commonly used as a model to study the growth and virulence of influenza A viruses in mammals but are not a natural host and have distinct sialic acid receptor profiles compared to humans. Using experimental infections with different subtypes of influenza A virus derived from different hosts, we found that evolution of influenza A virus in mice did not necessarily proceed through the linear accumulation of host-adaptive mutations, that there was variation in the patterns of mutations detected in each repetition, and that the mutation dynamics depended on the virus examined. In addition, variation in the viral receptor, sialic acid, did not affect influenza virus evolution in this model. Overall, our results show that while mice provide a useful animal model for influenza virus pathology, host passage evolution will vary depending on the specific virus tested.

Here, we infected 3D(pol) transgenic mice with another picornavirus, as well as an alphaherpesvirus and a rhabdovirus. 3D(pol) transgenic FVB mice had significantly lower viral loads and survived longer after infection with all three types of viruses than nontransgenic FVB mice. Viral inhibition among three different types of virus by transgenic 3D(pol) suggests that the mechanism of action is not the direct interference with picornaviral 3D(pol) but instead may be the changing of host cells to an antiviral state before or after viral infection occurs, as basal interferon levels were higher in 3D(pol) transgenic mice before infection. Further study of this mechanism may open new possibilities for future antiviral therapy.																					WOS:000285095800055	20962089

Animal models of HCMV infection are required for study of pathogenesis, because of the strict species-specificity of cytomegalovirus (CMV). Among the small animal CMV models, the guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) has unique advantages, in particular its propensity to cross the placenta, causing disease in utero. In order to develop quantitative endpoints for vaccine and antiviral therapeutic studies in the GPCMV model, a quantitative-competitive PCR (qcPCR) assay was developed, based on the GPCMV homolog of the HCMV UL83 gene, GP83. Optimal amplification of GPCMV DNA was observed using primers spanning a 248 base pair (bp) region of this gene. A 91 by deletion of this cloned fragment was generated for use as an internal standard (IS) for PCR amplification. Standard curves based upon the fluorescent intensity of full-length external target to IS were compared with signal intensity of DNA extracted from blood and organs of experimentally infected guinea pigs in order to quantify viral load. Viral load in newborn guinea pigs infected transplacentally was determined and compared with that of pups infected with GPCMV as neonates. Viral loads were highest in pups infected as neonates. The most consistent isolation and highest quantities of viral DNA were observed in liver and spleen, although viral genome could be readily identified in brain, lung, and salivary gland. Viral load determination should be useful for monitoring outcomes following vaccine studies, as well as responses to experimental antiviral agents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

It is not entirely clear whether CD4+ T-cell help is necessary for establishing anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses that successfully control liver infection. To address the role of CD4+ T cells in acute viral hepatitis, we infected mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) of the strain WE; LCMV-WE causes acute hepatitis in mice and is cleared from the liver by CD8+ T cells within about two weeks. The role of CD4+ T-cell help was studied in CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice, which were either induced by genetic deficiency of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) in CIITA-/- mice, or by antibody-mediated CD4+ cell depletion. We found that CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice developed protracted viral liver infection, which seemed to be a consequence of reduced virus-specific CD8+ T-cell numbers in the liver. Moreover, the antiviral effector functions of the liver-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in response to stimulation with LCMV peptide, notably the IFN-gamma production and degranulation capacity were impaired in CIITA-/- mice. The impaired CD8+ T-cell function in CIITA-/- mice was not associated with increased expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our findings indicate that CD4+ T-cell help is required to establish an effective antiviral CD8+ T-cell response in the liver during acute viral infection. Insufficient virus control and protracted viral hepatitis may be consequences of impaired initial CD4+ T-cell help.																					WOS:000330244500236	24466045

Generation of menangle virus nucleocapsid-like particles in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae								JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY				130	4			441	447		10.1016/j.jbiotec.2007.05.013				JUL 15 2007	2007	Menangle virus (MenV), which was isolated in Australia in 1997 during an outbreak of severe reproductive disease in pigs, is a novel member of the genus Rubulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. Although successfully eradicated from the affected piggery, fruit bats are considered to be the natural reservoir of the virus and therefore an ongoing risk of re-introduction to the pig population exists. Accordingly, reagents to facilitate serological surveillance are required to enhance the diagnostic capability for MenV, which is a newly recognized cause of disease in pigs with the potential to severely affect production in naive breeding herds. To address this need, recombinant MenV nucleocapsid (N) protein was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the expression vector pFGG3 under control of the GAL7 promoter, high yields of recombinant MenV N protein were obtained. Electron microscopy demonstrated that purified recombinant N protein self-assembled into nucleocapsid-like particles which were identical in density and morphology, although not in length, to authentic nucleocapsids from virus-infected cells. Electron microscopy analysis also showed that yeast-expressed N protein which lacked the C-terminal tail (amino acid residues 400-519) formed significantly longer and denser nucleocapsid-like particles. Nucleocapsid-like particles derived from the full-length recombinant protein were stable and readily purified by CsCI gradient ultracentrifugation. When used as coating antigen in an indirect ELISA, the recombinant N protein reacted with sera derived from pigs experimentally infected with MenV and a simple serological assay to detect MenV-specific antibodies in pigs, fruit bats and humans could be designed on this basis.(c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, cats, tigers, lions, mints, and ferrets were naturally or experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2. For the surveillance and control of this highly infectious disease, it is critical to trace susceptible animals and predict the consequence of potential mutations at the binding region of viral spike protein and host ACE2 protein. This study proposed a novel bioinformatics framework to systematically trace susceptible animals to SARS-CoV-2 and predict the binding affinity between susceptible animals' mutated/un-mutated ACE2 receptors. As a result, we identified a few animals posing a potential risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 using the docking analysis of ACE2 protein and viral spike protein. The binding affinity of some of these species is weaker than that of humans but more potent than that of Chinese horseshoe bats. We also found that a few point mutations in human ACE2 protein or viral spike protein could significantly enhance their binding affinity, posing an enormous potential threat to public health. The ancestors of the Omicron may evolve rapidly through the accumulation of mutations in infecting the host and jumped into human beings. These findings indicate that if the epidemic expands, there may be a human-animal-human transmission route, which will increase the difficulty of disease prevention and control.

Arenavirus Glycan Shield Promotes Neutralizing Antibody Evasion and Protracted Infection								PLOS PATHOGENS				11	11					e1005276	10.1371/journal.ppat.1005276				NOV 2015	2015	Arenaviruses such as Lassa virus (LASV) can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. As a major impediment to vaccine development, delayed and weak neutralizing antibody (nAb) responses represent a unifying characteristic of both natural infection and all vaccine candidates tested to date. To investigate the mechanisms underlying arenavirus nAb evasion we engineered several arenavirus envelope-chimeric viruses and glycan-deficient variants thereof. We performed neutralization tests with sera from experimentally infected mice and from LASV-convalescent human patients. NAb response kinetics in mice correlated inversely with the N-linked glycan density in the arenavirus envelope protein's globular head. Additionally and most intriguingly, infection with fully glycosylated viruses elicited antibodies, which neutralized predominantly their glycan-deficient variants, both in mice and humans. Binding studies with monoclonal antibodies indicated that envelope glycans reduced nAb on-rate, occupancy and thereby counteracted virus neutralization. In infected mice, the envelope glycan shield promoted protracted viral infection by preventing its timely elimination by the ensuing antibody response. Thus, arenavirus envelope glycosylation impairs the protective efficacy rather than the induction of nAbs, and thereby prevents efficient antibody-mediated virus control. This immune evasion mechanism imposes limitations on antibody-based vaccination and convalescent serum therapy.																					WOS:000368332000032	26587982

Our recent studies showing that the amount of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in the trigeminal ganglia of heat-stressed untreated mice is higher than the amount in heat-stressed mice treated with the COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, have indicated that the prostaglandin synthesis pathway-and in particular COX-2-may be an intermediate in the pathway to herpes viral reactivation. To further study this process, we infected the corneas of mice using topical application to a lightly scratched epithelium and waited 30 days for Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latency to be established in the trigeminal ganglia. Prior to the induction of viral reactivation, the mice were treated orally with celecoxib. Treated and untreated mice were induced to undergo reactivation by immersion in 43 C water for 10 min. The shedding of virus at the ocular surface was determined by culturing ocular swabs with indicator cells. The presence of infectious virus in the trigeminal ganglion was evaluated by incubating ganglion homogenates with indicator cells and observing for cytopathic effect. Celecoxib treatment significantly suppressed viral reactivation when given prophylactically by the gastrointestinal route. The numbers of corneas and ganglia containing infectious virus were significantly lower in the celecoxib-treated animals, compared to the placebo-treated mice. These experiments demonstrate that a selective COX-2 inhibitor can suppress hyperthermic stress-induced herpes viral reactivation in the nervous system. It may be possible to use COX-2 inhibitors to prevent viral reactivation in high-risk patients by drug prophylaxis.																					WOS:000228731300003	15857277

Group B coxsackieviruses are believed to be the most common viral agents responsible for human heart disease. Genomic data of enteroviruses has allowed developing new molecular approaches such as Nucleic Acid Sequence Based Amplification (NASBA) for detection of such viruses. In this study, coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) was detected in virus-infected cell culture and specimens of artificially infected mice with specific primers using Reverse Transcription - Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and NASBA techniques. According to the results, both techniques could be used for the detection of viruses in cell culture and artificially infected animals. NASBA reaction was simpler to perform than RT-PCR. The only variable factor that had to be optimized with NASBA is KCl concentration. The optimal concentration of KCI was determined as 90 mM. Serial dilutions of 1 mu g of total RNA showed that both RT-PCR and NASBA could detect the virus at 10(-5) dilution. Analyses of heart and spleen samples from infected animals were positive for presence of Coxsackievirus B3 with both RT-PCR and NASBA. In conclusion, NASBA offers some advantages over RT-PCR and is a suitable alternative technique for the sensitive detection of CVB3 in contaminated samples.																					BCI:BCI200900183375

Previous studies have detected the presence of viable virus particles in bovine milk samples naturally and experimentally contaminated with VACV. However, it is not known whether milk contaminated with VACV could be a route of viral transmission. However, anti-Orthopoxvirus antibodies were detected in humans from BV endemic areas, whom had no contact with affected cows, which suggest that other VACV transmission routes are possible, such as consumption of contaminated milk and dairy products. Therefore, it is important to study the possibility of VACV transmission by contaminated milk. This study aimed to examine VACV transmission, pathogenesis and shedding in mice orally inoculated with experimentally contaminated milk. Thirty mice were orally inoculated with milk containing 10(7) PFU/ml of VACV, and ten mice were orally inoculated with uncontaminated milk. Clinical examinations were performed for 30 consecutive days, and fecal samples and oral swabs (OSs) were collected every other day. Mice were euthanized on predetermined days, and tissue and blood samples were collected. Nested-PCR, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), viral isolation, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods were performed on the collected samples. No clinical changes were observed in the animals. Viral DNA was detected in feces, blood, OSs and tissues, at least in one of the times tested. The lungs displayed moderate to severe interstitial lymphohistiocytic infiltrates, and only the heart, tonsils, tongue, and stomach did not show immunostaining at the IHC analysis. Neutralizing antibodies were detected at the 20th and 30th days post infection in 50% of infected mice. The results revealed that VACV contaminated milk could be a route of viral transmission in mice experimentally infected, showing systemic distribution and shedding through feces and oral mucosa, albeit without exhibiting any clinical signs.

J	Smith, Candice A.; Kulkarni, Upasana; Chen, Judy; Goldstein, Daniel R.								Influenza virus inoculum volume is critical to elucidate age-dependent mortality in mice								AGING CELL				18	2					e12893	10.1111/acel.12893				APR 2019	2019	The elderly exhibit increased mortality to influenza viral infection for unclear reasons. Mice are frequently used to model how aging impacts disease. Several studies have shown that aged mice exhibit an increased mortality to influenza virus, but two recent studies demonstrated the opposite. These two studies administered the virus intranasally in 20 mu L, whereas the other studies used a viral inoculum in at least 30 mu L. To determine whether the volume of the inoculum could explain the conflicting reports, we infected young and aged mice via intranasal instillation of 40 mu L or 20 mu L containing 1 x 10(4) plaque-forming units (PFU) of H1N1 influenza virus. We found that intranasal administration of 40 mu L but not 20 mu L of inoculum resulted in age-dependent mortality in mice. Compared to aged mice infected with 40 mu L inoculum, those infected with 20 mu L inoculum showed reduced levels of live virus and IFN-beta in the lung 3 days postinfection. Furthermore, aged mice administered 40 mu L of Evans blue intranasally displayed increased dye retention in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared to those administered 20 mu L of Evans blue. Our data demonstrate that the inoculating volume of virus is critical for adequate delivery of influenza virus to the lung and thus for efficient infection of aged mice. These findings shed light on discrepant results in the literature regarding aged mice and influenza infection, and establish that mice can be used to examine how aging impacts the response to this biomedically important infection.

Yellow-necked field mice (Apodemus flavicollis) and bank voles (Clethrionomys glareolus) were either immunized with TEE virus by subcutaneous inoculation of the virus, or they were exposed to virus-infected Ixodes ricinus ticks. One month later, when serum neutralizing antibody was detectable, the animals were infested with infected (donor) adult female ticks and uninfected (recipient) nymphal ticks; recipients were allowed to feed either in close contact (chamber 1) or physically separated (chamber 2) from the infected donor ticks. Following challenge with infected (and uninfected) ticks, viremia developed in all the control, nonimmune animals, whereas viremia was undetectable in all those animals naturally immunized by previous exposure to infected ticks. Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies in all the immunized animals, 89% (24/27) immune animals supported virus transmission between infected and uninfected cofeeding ticks. Most transmission was localized, occurring within chamber 1; disseminated transmission from chamber 1 to chamber 2 was reduced. Immunization by tick bite was more Effective than immunization by syringe inoculation in blocking cofeeding virus transmission Nevertheless 75% (9/12) animals with ''natural'' immunity still supported transmission. The results demonstrate that natural hosts having neutralizing antibodies to TEE virus (and no detectable viremia) can still support virus transmission between infected and uninfected ticks feeding closely together on the same animal. These observations have important epidemiological implications relating to the survival of TEE virus in Nature. (C) 1997 Academic Press.																					WOS:A1997XT89500014	9300045

Both mouse strains were resistant to intraperitoneal infection with MHV 4 or MHVA 59 and only the A/J mice showed resistance to MHV 3, the, BALB/c mice being fully susceptible to this virus infection. Comparable growth kinetics, for all three viruses, were observed in both mouse strains, except for the MHV 3 growth in BALB/c mice, where the virus titre increased to a peak on day 2, remaining high until day 4 when the mice died of acute hepatitis. The IFN gamma titres in the peritoneum of mice preceded and correlated with the virus growth, higher titres being found in MHV 3 infected BALB/c mice. The highest titre was always observed 24 to 48 h after infection. Among viral strains grown in cultured macrophages, higher titres were always observed in cultures infected with MHVA 59, followed by MHV 3 and the lowest those infected with MHV 4. The macrophage activation by IFN gamma-induced a partial restriction of virus growth only in MHV 3 infected A/J mouse macrophages. A virus specificity of the IFN gamma-induced antiviral state was shown to be in direct correlation with the resistance of mice to MHV 3 infection.																					WOS:A1993LV75700005	7691047

Two mice each were either mock infected or inoculated with one of three BVDV strains by the intraperitoneal (IP) (n = 8) or intranasal (IN) (n = 8) route. All mice were euthanized at day 7 postinfection (p.i.). None of the infected mice exhibited any clinical signs of illness; however, the tissues harvested after BVDV challenge showed significant histopathological changes. Blood samples from five mice that were injected IP and one mouse that was inoculated IN were positive for BVDV by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to assess the presence of viral antigen in the organs of mice infected with three BVDV strains. In IP-injected mice, BVDV antigen was detected in the spleen (5/6), mesenteric lymph nodes (4/6), lymphatic tissue of the lung (3/6), lung (1/6), and stomach (1/6) of the infected mice; however, it was not detected in the liver (0/6) or kidney (0/6). In IN-inoculated mice, BVDV antigen was detected in the lung and mesenteric lymph nodes of one BVDV-infected mouse but was not detected in other tissues. The results of this study suggest that the spleen is the most reliable tissue for BVDV antigen detection using IHC in the IP-injected group. Our study demonstrates that mice can be infected by BVDV. This is the first report of BVDV infection in mice.																					WOS:000354388500021	25850760

Modulation of Host Immunity by the Human Metapneumovirus								CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY REVIEWS				29	4			795	818		10.1128/CMR.00081-15				OCT 2016	2016	Globally, as a leading agent of acute respiratory tract infections in children < 5 years of age and the elderly, the human metapneumovirus (HMPV) has gained considerable attention. As inferred from studies comparing vaccinated and experimentally infected mice, the acquired immune response elicited by this pathogen fails to efficiently clear the virus from the airways, which leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response and lung damage. Furthermore, after disease resolution, there is a poor development of T and B cell immunological memory, which is believed to promote reinfections and viral spread in the community. In this article, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that shape the interactions of HMPV with host tissues that lead to pulmonary pathology and to the development of adaptive immunity that fails to protect against natural infections by this virus.

Toll-like receptor 3 is an essential component of the innate stress response in virus-induced cardiac injury								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY				292	1			H251	H258		10.1152/ajpheart.00398.2006				JAN 1 2007	2007	Enterovirus-induced myocardial injury can lead to severe heart failure. To date, little is known about the early innate stress response that contributes to host defense in the heart. Toll-like receptor 3 ( TLR3) is important in the initiation of the innate antiviral response. We investigated the involvement of TLR3, which recognizes viral double- stranded RNA, on encephalomyocarditis virus ( EMCV) infection. To examine the contribution of TLR3 in protection from EMCV infection, we infected mice deficient in TLR3 with 50 plaque-forming units of EMCV. TLR3-deficient ( TLR3 (-/-)) mice were more susceptible to EMCV infection and had a significantly higher viral load in the heart compared with TLR3 (-/-) mice. Histopathological examination showed that the inflammatory changes of the myocardium were less marked in TLR3(-/-) than in TLR3(-/-) mice. TLR3(-/-) mice had impaired proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression in the heart following EMCV infection. However, the expression of interferon-beta was not impaired in EMCV- infected TLR3(-/-) mice. EMCV infection leads to a TLR3- dependent innate stress response, which is involved in mediating protection against virus- induced myocardial injury.

CXCR2 is required for neutrophil recruitment to the lung during influenza virus infection, but is not essential for viral clearance								VIRAL IMMUNOLOGY				20	3			369	377		10.1089/vim.2006.0101				SEP 2007	2007	Neutrophils traffic to the lungs in large numbers during influenza virus infection. Although the ability of these cells to respond to numerous chemotactic stimuli has been described in other systems, the chemokine receptors mediating recruitment of neutrophils to the lungs during influenza virus infection and the role of this cell type in viral clearance are currently undefined. In the present study, we used CXCR2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of the chemokine receptor CXCR2 in neutrophil recruitment to the lungs during influenza virus infection and to determine the role of neutrophils in viral clearance. We infected CXCR2(-/-) or wild-type mice with influenza and assessed the level of inflammation, the cellular composition of the inflammatory infiltrate, and viral titers in the lungs. Absence of CXCR2 ablated neutrophil recruitment to the lungs, but had no effect on peak viral titers or on the kinetics of viral clearance. Thus, it appears that CXCR2 is the major receptor mediating neutrophil trafficking to the lung during influenza virus infection, but that neutrophils do not play an essential role in viral clearance.

Finding that immunocompromised mice were resistant to human astrovirus infection via multiple routes of inoculation, our studies aimed to determine whether murine astrovirus (MuAstV) could be used to model human astrovirus disease. We experimentally infected wild-type mice with MuAstV isolated from immunocompromised mice and found that the virus was detected throughout the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, but was not associated with diarrhea. The virus was also detected in the lung. Although virus levels were higher in recently weaned mice, the levels were similar in male and female adult mice. Using two distinct viruses isolated from different immunocompromised mouse strains, we observed virus strain-specific differences in the duration of infection (3 versus 10 weeks) in wild-type mice, indicating that the within-host immune pressure from donor mice shaped the virus kinetics in immunocompetent recipient hosts. Both virus strains elicited minimal pathology and a lack of sustained immunity. In summary, MuAstV represents a useful model for studying asymptomatic human infection and gaining insight into the astrovirus pathogenesis and immunity.IMPORTANCE Astroviruses are widespread in both birds and mammals; however, little is known about the pathogenesis and the immune response to the virus due to the lack of a well-characterized small-animal model. Here we describe two distinct strains of murine astrovirus that cause infections in immunocompetent mice that mirror aspects of asymptomatic human infections, including minimal pathology and short-lived immunity. However, we noted that the duration of infection differed greatly between the strains, highlighting an important facet of these viruses that was not previously appreciated. The ubiquitous nature and diversity of murine astroviruses coupled with the continuous likelihood of reinfection raise the possibility of viral interference with other mouse models of disease.

An immunofluorescence test for the detection of viral antigen in tissue impression smears was evaluated as a rapid diagnostic test for HPAI virus infections of poultry. Several test configurations were compared for background reactions and strength of fluorescence, with the optimum combination found to be an influenza A group-specific monoclonal antibody, detected by an anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Immunohistochemical examination of tissues from chickens experimentally infected with low-pathogenicity and HPAI viruses identified the pancreas as the organ most consistently containing high concentrations of HPAI viral antigen. This test has since been used in Australia in the rapid laboratory confirmation of three avian influenza outbreaks and in showing that numerous other suspect cases were not caused by avian influenza.					5th International Symposium on Avian Influenza5th International Symposium on Avian Influenza	APR 14-17, 2002APR 14-17, 2002		ATHENS, GAATHENS, GA													WOS:000185516000079	14575140	
J	Anukumar, Balakrishnan; Shahir, Prajakta								Chandipura Virus infection in mice: the role of toll like receptor 4 in pathogenesis								BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES				12						125	10.1186/1471-2334-12-125				MAY 29 2012	2012	Background: The susceptibility of mice and humans to Chandipura virus infection is age-dependent. Upon experimental infection, mice secrete significant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Similarly, children who recover from natural infection with the virus show significant amounts of TNF-alpha production, suggesting that innate immunity plays a major role in the response to Chandipura virus. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are key host molecules involved in innate immune responses in infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the role of TLR in the response to Chandipura virus infection.Methods: The mouse monocyte-macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, and C3H/HeJ mice were used as models. Micro array techniques were used to identify the type of TLR involved in the response to infection. The results were validated by examining TLR expression using flow cytometry and by measuring the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in the culture supernatants using bead assays and the Griess method, respectively. The pathogenic role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was studied in a TLR4 mutant strain of mice- C3H/HeJ and the results compared with those from wild-type mice -C3H/CaJ. The pathogenic effects of NO were studied by treating experimentally infected mice with the NO inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG).Results: The micro array results showed that TLR4 was regulated after Chandipura virus infection. At high multiplicities of infection (10 MOI), RAW cells up- regulated cell surface expression of TLR4 and secreted significant amounts of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-10 and IL-12 and NO. The survival rate of C3H/HeJ mice was higher than those of wild-type C3H/CaJ mice. The survived C3H/HeJ mice secreted significant quantity of MCP-1 and IFN gamma cytokines and cleared virus from brain. Similarly, the survival rate of AG-treated mice was higher than those of the untreated controls.Conclusions: Chandipura virus regulates TLR4, which leads to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and NO by infected RAW cells. Difference in survival rate in TLR4 mutant mice and nitric oxide inhibitor treated mice, confirmed the role of these molecules in disease pathogenesis. The result is significant in clinical management and designing antiviral intervention for Chandipura virus infection.																					WOS:000307958300001	22642811

Treatment with ED-rat serum altered viral gene expression in persistently infected cultured rat glioblastoma cells. These data suggest that antibodies, produced in the brain, may influence viral gene expression. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Melatonin (MLT), minocycline (MIN) and ascorbic acid (AA) have been shown to have antiviral activities in experimental infections; however, the mechanisms involved are poorly studied. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effects of those compounds on the viral titers, NO production and lipid peroxidation in the brain of mice and neuroblastoma cultures infected by VEE virus. Infected mouse (10 LD50) were treated with MLT (500 mu g/kg bw), MIN (50 mg/kg bw) or AA (50 mg/kg bw). Infected neuroblastoma cultures (MOI: 1); MLT: 0.5, 1, 5 mM, MIN: 0.1, 0.2, 2 mu M or AA: 25, 50, 75 mu M. Brains were obtained at days 1, 3 and 5. In addition, survival rate of infected treated mice was also analyzed. Viral replication was determined by the plaque formation technique. NO and lipid peroxidation were measured by Griess' reaction and thiobarbituric acid assay respectively. Increased viral replication, NO production and lipid peroxidation were observed in both, infected brain and neuroblastoma cell cultures compared with uninfected controls. Those effects were diminished by the studied treatments. In addition, increased survival rate (50%) in treated infected animals compared with untreated infected mice (0%) was found. MLT, MIN and AA have an antiviral effect involving their anti-oxidant properties, and suggesting a potential use of these compounds for human VEE virus infection. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This report describes findings from experimental infection of inbred Lewis rats with Seoul virus strain 80-39. Rats inoculated with virus intraperitoneally at 6 days of age became persistently infected without clinical signs. Tissues from Seoul virus-inoculated 6-day-old rats were assessed at 6, 9, and 12 weeks post-inoculation for viral RNA by RT-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) and for infectious virus by inoculation of Vero E6 cells. Virus was isolated from lung and kidney of infected rats at 6 weeks and viral RNA was detected in lung, kidney, pancreas, salivary gland, brain, spleen, liver and skin at 6, 9 and 12 weeks. Rats inoculated with Seoul virus intraperitoneally at 10 or 21 days of age became infected without clinical signs but had low to undetectable levels of viral RNA in tissues at 6 weeks post-inoculation. ISH identified vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells as common sites of persistent infection. Cultured rat smooth muscle cells and to a lesser extent cultured endothelial cells also were susceptible to Seoul virus infection. Pancreatic infection resulted in insulitis with associated hyperglycemia. These studies demonstrate that infant Lewis rats are uniformly susceptible to asymptomatic persistent Seoul virus infection. Additionally, they offer opportunities for correlative in vivo and in vitro study of Seoul virus interactions in host cell types that support persistent infection.

Subsequent immune suppression leads to viral reactivation from latency and the onset of a variety of pathologies, including lymphoproliferative disease and cancers. CD8 T cells play a key role in preventing reactivation of latent virus. Therefore, to develop effective therapeutic immune strategies, it is essential to understand the maintenance of CD8 T cell responses during latency. Because the gamma-herpesviruses are highly species-specific and mice cannot be infected with the human pathogens, EBV or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, we have used a natural rodent gamma-herpesvirus experimental infection model, gamma-herpesvirus-68. In this report, we show that during long-term latent infection, naive CD8 T cells are recruited into the ongoing immune response in an epitope-specific manner. When virus reactivation is induced in vivo, the recruitment of CD8 T cells for some, but not all, epitopes is enhanced. The variation in recruitment is not due to differences in epitope presentation. We also show that CD8 T cells that are newly stimulated during reactivation are functionally impaired compared with acutely stimulated cells in terms of cytokine production. Thus, our results demonstrate unexpected complexity in the response of CD8 T cells specific for different viral epitopes that were stimulated during acute infection, quiescent latency, and reactivation.

J	Oh, Seon Hwan; Bae, Jung Eun; Kim, In Seop								Multiplex Reverse Transcription-PCR for Simultaneous Detection of Reovirus, Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus, and Bovine Parainfluenza Virus during the Manufacture of Cell Culture-derived Biopharmaceuticals								Korean Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology				40	4			339	347		10.4014/kjmb.1210.10008				DEC 2012	2012	Viral safety is an important prerequisite for clinical preparations of mammalian cell culture-derived biopharmaceuticals, because numerous adventitious viruses have been contaminated during the manufacturing process. In particular, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are highly susceptible to several RNA viruses including reovirus (Reo), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza virus (BPIV) and there have been reports of such viral contaminations. Therefore, viral detection during the CHO cell process is necessary to ensure the safety of biopharmaceuticals against viruses. In this study, a multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay was developed and subsequently evaluated for its effectiveness as a means to simultaneously detect Reo, BVDV, and BPIV during the manufacture of cell culture-derived biopharmaceuticals. Specific primers for Reo, BVDV, and BPIV were selected, and a multiplex RT-PCR was optimized. The sensitivity of the assay for simultaneous amplification of all viral target RNAs was 7.76x10(2) TCID50/ml for Reo, 7.44x10(1) TCID50/ml for BVDV, and 6.75x10(1) TCID50/ml for BPIV. The multiplex RT-PCR was proven to be very specific to Reo, BVDV, and BPIV and was subsequently applied to the validation of CHO cells artificially infected with each virus. It could detect each viral RNA from CHO cells as well as culture supernatants. Therefore, it was concluded that the multiplex RT-PCR assay can be applied to detection of the adventitious viruses during the manufacture of cell culture-derived biopharmaceuticals.

The aim of the present study was to identify topographical differences of TMEV spread and demyelination in the brain of experimentally infected susceptible SJL/J mice and resistant C57BL/6 mice. Methods: Demyelination was confirmed by Luxol fast blue and cresyl violet staining and axonal damage by neurofilament-specific and beta-amyloid precursor protein-specific immunohistochemistry. Viral dissemination within the central nervous system (CNS) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Further, the phenotype of infected cells was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: An early transient infection of periventricular cells followed by demyelination and axonopathies around the fourth ventricle in SJL/J mice was noticed. Periventricular and brain stem demyelination was associated with a predominant infection of microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes. Conclusions: Summarized, the demonstration of ependymal infection and subjacent spread into the brain parenchyma as well as regional virus clearance despite ongoing demyelination and axonal damage in other CNS compartments allows new insights into TME pathogenesis. This novel aspect of TMEV CNS interaction will enhance the understanding of region-specific susceptibilities to injury and regenerative capacities of the brain in this MS model. Copyright (C) 2012 S.

To determine if the presence of a functional Mxl (fMx1) gene would influence this brain viral localization and/or disease, we infected mature C57BL/6 dMx1 and fMx1 mice under the same conditions and observed sickness behaviors, viral nucleoprotein (NP) RNA expression and innate immune mediator (IIM) mRNA expression in selected tissues at 15 and 96 h post-infection. Virus invaded the OB and lungs comparably in both sub-strains at 15 and 96 h as determined by nested PCR. In contrast, virus was present in blood and somatosensory cortex of dMxl, but not fMx1 mice at 96 h. At 15 h, sickness behaviors were comparable in both sub-strains. By 96 h dMx1, but not xi, were moribund. In both 15 and 96 h lungs, viral NP was significantly elevated in the dMx1 mice compared to the fMx1 mice, as determined by quantitative PCR. OB expression of most IIM mRNAs was similar at both time periods in both sub-strains. In contrast, lung IIM mRNAs were elevated in fMx1 at 15 h, but by 96 h were consistently reduced compared to dMx1 mice. In conclusion, functional Mxl did not alter OB invasion by virus but attenuated illness compared to dMx1 mice. Inflammation was similar in OBs and lungs of both strains at 15 h but by 96 h it was suppressed in lungs, but not in OBs, of fMx1 mice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Infectivity period of mice inoculated with human adenoviruses								LABORATORY ANIMALS				45	2			103	108		10.1258/la.2010.010084				APR 2011	2011	Due to non-productive infections, mice are not a good model to study some human adenoviruses. However, mice provide an excellent model to study the metabolic effects of human adenovirus, Ad36. Research interest in Ad36 is increasing rapidly, and consequently an increase in the use of mice as a model is anticipated. However, little is known about the transmission potential of Ad36 from infected mice to other laboratory animals or personnel. While underestimating the infectivity could promote inadvertent spread of Ad36, overstating it could drain valuable laboratory resources and animals. Therefore, we determined the duration of infectivity in female C57BL/6J mice that were experimentally infected with human adenoviruses Ad36 or Ad2. Other uninfected mice were co-housed for one week with the experimentally-infected animals, four or eight weeks postinfection. Additionally, uninfected mice were housed in the cages of mice that were infected with Ad36, 12 weeks earlier. The presence of viral DNA in tissues was used to indicate infection of mice. Although experimentally-infected mice harboured viral DNA at least up to 12 weeks, the horizontal transmission of infection was observed in co-housed mice only up to four weeks postinfection. Thus, Ad36-infected mice should be considered potentially infective for eight weeks and appropriate handling and barrier containment should be used. After eight week postinfection, horizontal transmission appears unlikely. This information may provide guidelines for animal handling, and experimental design using Ad36, which may increase safety for laboratory personnel and reduce the number of mice required for experiments.

Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68 LANA Is Essential for Virus Reactivation from Splenocytes but Not Long-Term Carriage of Viral Genome								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				84	14			7214	7224		10.1128/JVI.00133-10				JUL 2010	2010	ORF73, which encodes the latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), is a conserved gamma-2-herpesvirus gene. The murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) LANA (mLANA) is critical for efficient virus replication and the establishment of latent infection following intranasal inoculation. To test whether the initial host immune response limits the capacity of mLANA-null virus to traffic to and establish latency in the spleen, we infected type I interferon receptor knockout (IFN-alpha/beta R(-/-)) mice via intranasal inoculation and observed the presence of viral genome-positive splenocytes at day 18 postinfection at approximately 10-fold-lower levels than in the genetically repaired marker rescue-infected mice. However, no mLANA-null virus reactivation from infected IFN-alpha/beta R(-/-) splenocytes was observed. To more thoroughly define a role of mLANA in MHV68 infection, we evaluated the capacity of an mLANA-null virus to establish and maintain infection apart from restriction in the lungs of immunocompetent mice. At day 18 following intraperitoneal infection of C57BL/6 mice, the mLANA-null virus was able to establish a chronic infection in the spleen albeit at a 5-fold-reduced level. However, as in IFN-alpha/beta R(-/-) mice, little or no virus reactivation could be detected from mLANA-null virus-infected splenocytes upon explant. An examination of peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) following intraperitoneal inoculation revealed nearly equivalent frequencies of PECs harboring the mLANA-null virus relative to the marker rescue virus. Furthermore, although significantly compromised, mLANA-null virus reactivation from PECs was detected upon explant. Notably, at later times postinfection, the frequency of mLANA-null genome-positive splenocytes was indistinguishable from that of marker rescue virus-infected animals. Analyses of viral genome-positive splenocytes revealed the absence of viral episomes in mLANA-null infected mice, suggesting that the viral genome is integrated or maintained in a linear state. Thus, these data provide the first evidence that a LANA homolog is directly involved in the formation and/or maintenance of an extrachromosomal viral episome in vivo, which is likely required for the reactivation of MHV68.

Murine Norovirus Infection Has No Significant Effect on Adaptive Immunity to Vaccinia Virus or Influenza A Virus								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				83	14			7357	7360		10.1128/JVI.00623-09				JUL 15 2009	2009	Murine norovirus (MNV) is endemic in many research mouse colonies. Although MNV infections are typically asymptomatic in immunocompetent mice, the effects of MNV infection on subsequent experimental viral infections are poorly documented. Here, we infected C57BL/6 mice with MNV and then with either vaccinia virus or influenza A virus. MNV infection had no effect on CD8(+) T-cell or antibody responses to secondary viruses or to secondary virus-induced morbidity or mortality. While our findings suggest that MNV has little influence on host immunity in immunocompetent mice, we would urge caution regarding the potential effects of MNV on immune responses to viruses and other pathogens, which must be determined on a system-by-system basis.

However, other cellular processes may also produce dsRNA and there are other receptors for dsRNA. The role of TLR3 in protective immunity to viruses has been investigated in mice and humans with genetically impaired TLR3 responses. TLR3-deficient mice responded to experimental challenge with 16 different viruses in various ways. They were susceptible to eight viruses, normally resistant to three other viruses, and their survival rates were higher than those of wild-type mice following infection with four other viruses. Conflicting results were obtained for the other virus tested. These data are difficult to understand in terms of a simple pattern based on virus structure or tissue tropism. Surprisingly, the known human patients with inborn errors of the TLR3 pathway have remained healthy or developed encephalitis in the course of natural primary infection with HSV-1. These patients display no clear susceptibility to other infections, including viral infections, such as other forms of viral encephalitis and other HSV-1 diseases in particular. This restricted susceptibility to viruses seems to result from impaired TLR3-dependent IFN-alpha/beta production by central nervous system (CNS)-resident non-hematopoietic cells infected with HSV-1. These studies neatly illustrate the value of combining genetic studies of experimental infections in mice and natural infections in humans, to elucidate the biological function of host molecules in protective immunity.

Here, we analyzed the role of the nuclear import factor importin-alpha 7 in H1N1 influenza virus pulmonary tropism by using various ex vivo imaging techniques (magnetic resonance imaging, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and correlative light-electron microscopy). We infected importin-alpha 7 gene-deficient (alpha 7(-/-)) mice with a recombinant H1N1 influenza virus and compared the in vivo viral kinetics with those in wild-type (WT) mice. In WT mice, influenza virus replication in the bronchial and alveolar epithelium already occurred a few days after infection. Accordingly, extensive mononuclear infiltration and alveolar destruction were present in the lungs of infected WT mice, followed by 100% lethality. Conversely, in alpha 7(-/-) mice, virus replication was restricted mostly to the bronchial epithelium with marginal alveolar infection, resulting in significantly reduced lung damage and enhanced animal survival. To investigate the host immune response during alveolar virus replication, we studied the role of primary macrophages in virus propagation and clearance. The ability of macrophages to support or clear the virus infection, as well as the host cellular immune responses, did not significantly differ between WT and alpha 7(-/-) mice. However, cytokine and chemokine responses were generally elevated in WT mice, likely reflective of increased viral replication in the lung. In summary, these data show that a cellular factor, importin-alpha 7, is required for enhanced virus replication in the alveolar epithelium, resulting in elevated cytokine and chemokine levels, extensive mononuclear infiltration, and thus, severe pneumonia and enhanced virulence in mice.IMPORTANCEInfluenza A viruses are respiratory pathogens that may cause pneumonia in humans. Viral infection and replication in the alveoli of the respiratory tract are believed to be crucial for the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with fatal outcomes in influenza virus-infected patients. Here, we report the requirement of a cellular factor, importin-alpha 7, for efficient virus replication in the alveolar epithelium of mice. Using complementary ex vivo imaging approaches, we show that influenza virus replication is restricted to the bronchial epithelium, followed by enhanced survival in importin-alpha 7-deficient mice. In contrast, the presence of this gene results in enhanced virus replication in the alveoli, elevated cytokine and chemokine responses, mononuclear infiltration, alveolar destruction, and 100% lethality in wild-type mice. Taken together, our results show that importin-alpha 7 is particularly required for virus replication in the alveolar epithelium in association with severe pneumonia and death in mice.

Preparation and evaluation of vaccines in laboratory animals is an important preliminary step toward prevention and control of the disease. Here, virus-like particles (VLPs) of APPV were prepared and VLPs vaccine was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Purified E-rns and E2 proteins expressed in E. coli were allowed to self-assemble into VLPs, which had the appearance of hollow spherical particles with a diameter of about 100 nm by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The VLPs induced strong antibody responses and reduced the viral load in tissues of BALB/c mice. The data from animal challenge experiments, RT-PCR, and immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that BALB/c mice are an appropriate laboratory model for APPV. These results suggest the feasibility of using VLPs as a vaccine for the prevention and control of APPV and provide useful information for further study of APPV in laboratory animals.

The mice examined were of two kinds: (i) thymus-deficient BALB/c nu/nu nice and (ii) BALB/c mice experimentally depleted of T cells by systemic infusions of a monoclonal antibody to the CD4 or CD8 cell surface molecules. These mice were infected intranasally with a single dose of replication-competent VSV. Brain tissue homogenates were analyzed for the presence of infectious virus. For each population of mice, infection-related mortality was assessed. In histological sections of brain, the distribution of viral antigens (Ags) was examined by immunocytochemistry. We found that recovery of infectious virus from homogenates of tissues obtained from athymic nu/nu animals was more than 10 times greater than that from samples from their euthymic littermates. With a single exception in a BALB/c nu/nu mouse, virus was not isolated from the spleen when it was administered intranasally. In these experimental infections, athymic mice succumbed 1 to 2 days before their euthymic littermates. A dose of virus that resulted in half of the nu/+ survival rate was uniformly lethal to nu/nu mice. In experiments with BALB/c mice depleted of either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells by in vivo antibody treatment, histological analysis revealed an increase in viral Ag distribution in comparison with control (medium-infused) infected mice. Necrosis and inflammation paralleled the extent of viral Ag expression. Viral Ags were detected in discrete areas that usually remain uninfected in immunocompetent mice. These areas include the neocortex and caudate putamen nuclei, the piriform cortex, and the lateral olfactory tract. Neuronal loss and necrosis were consistently found in the olfactory bulb and the horizontal/vertical band of Broca. In some of the T-cell depleted mice, necrosis was also evident in the hippocampus, fimbria, mammillary bodies, and hypothalamic nuclei. In the brain stem, perivascular cuffing was evident, but with little necrosis. Collectively, these data suggest that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells make only a minor contribution to the development of histopathology but rather function together to limit viral replication and transsynaptic or ventricular spread of virus, thus promoting recovery. The primary effectors of histopathology appear to be related more to the cytopathologic nature of the virus infection and non-T-cell-mediated mechanisms.

ARVO Annual Meeting Abstract Search and Program Planner				2002				30	Abstract No. 30						2002	2002	Purpose: To better define the role that specific T cell subsets play during primary herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK). Methods: We infected the corneas of BALB/c, BALB-CD4 KO, BALB-CD8 KO and anti-CD8 treated BALB/c and anti-CD4 treated BALB/c with HSV-1, KOS strain virus. We also infected the corneas of C57BL/6 (B6), B6-CD4 KO, and B6-CD8 KO mice with HSV-1, McKrae strain virus. These mice were then evaluated for HSK disease, spread of viral infection, and viral load in the trigeminal ganglia. Results: Mice that lack CD8+ T cells demonstrated significantly more disease than did either BALB/c or B6 parental strains. In contrast mice without CD4+ T cells had less disease than parental controls. Infectious virus persisted slightly longer in the cornea, trigeminal ganglia, and periocular tissue in mice without CD4 or CD8 T cells. There were no significant differences in viral genome copies in trigeminal ganglia with latent viral infection. Interestingly, the incidence of viral encephalitis was greatest in mice without CD8 T cells, and virtually non-existent in mice without CD4 T cells. Conclusion: These data support the thesis that CD4+ T cells are not required for resistence to infection with HSV-1. However, they likely are the primary mediators for the development of HSK. They also suggest that CD8+ T cells play a protective role, either in controlling the viral disease, or in regulating the inflammatory immune response that mediates HSK.

However, little is known about disease progression, behavioral changes, CNS cytokine concentration, and neuropathology in limbic encephalitis in experimental models. Using Cocal virus, we infected C57Bl6 adult mice and studied the neuroanatomical distribution of viral antigens in correlation with the microglial morphological response, measured the CNS cytokine concentration, and assessed behavioral changes. C57Bl6 adult mice were maintained in an impoverished environment (IE) or enriched environment (EE) for four months and then subjected to the open field test. Afterwards, an equal volume of normal or virus-infected brain homogenate was nasally instilled. The brains were processed to detect viral antigens and microglial morphological changes using selective immunolabeling. We demonstrated earlier significant weight loss and higher mortality in IE mice. Additionally, behavioral analysis revealed a significant influence of the environment on locomotor and exploratory activity that was associated with less neuroinvasion and a reduced microglial response. Thus, environmental enrichment was associated with a more effective immune response in a mouse model of limbic encephalitis, allowing faster viral clearance/decreased viral dissemination, reduced disease progression, and less CNS damage.

J	Weingartl, Hana M.; Berhane, Yohannes; Czub, Markus								Animal models of henipavirus infection: A review								VETERINARY JOURNAL				181	3			211	220		10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.10.016				SEP 2009	2009	Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) form a separate genus Henipavirus within the family Paramyxoviridae, and are classified as biosafety level four pathogens due to their high case fatality rate following human infection and because of the lack of effective vaccines or therapy. Both viruses emerged from their natural reservoir during the last decade of the 20th century, causing severe disease in humans, horses and swine, and infecting a number of other mammalian species. The current review summarises current published data relating to experimental infection of small and large animals, including the natural reservoir species, the Pteropus bat, with HeV or NiV. Susceptibility to infection and virus distribution in the individual species is discussed, along with the pathogenesis, pathological changes, and potential routes of transmission.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the cell-entry receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)(2). Here we infected transgenic mice that express human ACE2 (hereafter, hACE2 mice) with SARS-CoV-2 and studied the pathogenicity of the virus. We observed weight loss as well as virus replication in the lungs of hACE2 mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. The typical histopathology was interstitial pneumonia with infiltration of considerable numbers of macrophages and lymphocytes into the alveolar interstitium, and the accumulation of macrophages in alveolar cavities. We observed viral antigens in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages and alveolar epithelia. These phenomena were not found in wild-type mice infected with SARS-CoV-2. Notably, we have confirmed the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in hACE2 mice. This mouse model of SARS-CoV-2 infection will be valuable for evaluating antiviral therapeutic agents and vaccines, as well as understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19.Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes interstitial pneumonia and viral replication in the lungs of transgenic mice that express a human version of ACE2, confirming the pathogenicity of the virus in this model.

J	NETTER, HJ; KAJINO, K; TAYLOR, JM								EXPERIMENTAL TRANSMISSION OF HUMAN HEPATITIS-DELTA VIRUS TO THE LABORATORY MOUSE								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				67	6			3357	3362		10.1128/JVI.67.6.3357-3362.1993				JUN 1993	1993	Human hepatitis delta virus (HDV), obtained from the serum of an experimentally infected woodchuck, was injected into either the peritoneal cavity or the tail vein of both adult CB17 mice and mice with a severe combined immunodeficiency (CB17-scid mice). Three lines of evidence indicated that the virus was able to reach the liver and infect hepatocytes: (i) the amount of HDV genomic RNA detected in the liver by Northern (RNA) analysis increased during the first 5 to 10 days postinoculation, reaching a peak that was about threefold the amount in the original inoculum; (ii) also detected in the liver was the viral antigenomic RNA, which is complementary to the genomic RNA found in virions, and is diagnostic for vims replication; and (iii) by immunoperoxidase staining of liver sections, the delta antigen was detected in the nuclei of scattered cells identifiable as hepatocytes. In all of the mice, clearance of the infection occurred between 10 and 20 days after inoculation. The half-life for clearance was about 3 days in CB17-scid mice, indicating that clearance of infection did not involve a T- and B-cell-dependent immune response. Cell-to-cell spread of the initial infection was not detected. One possible interpretation of our results is that HDV infection of hepatocytes is directly cytopathic. Also, the results imply that chronic infection of the liver in humans may require continuous spread of virus within the liver. Alternatively, HDV in the absence of helper virus may be unable to cause a chronic infection of hepatocytes in vivo.																					WOS:A1993LB79400048	8497056

These altered ultrastructures serve as sites for viral replication. In this study, we used transmission electron microscopy to investigate whether such structures were present in the liver of fatal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) autopsy cases. In parallel, electron microscopic examination of suckling mouse brains experimentally infected with DV was performed as an in vivo model of acute DV infection. Typical features of ER changes containing abundance of replicative virions were observed in neurons and microglia of DV-infected suckling mouse brains (SMB). This indicated that the in vivo DV infection could induce similar viral replication structures as previously described in the in vitro DV-infected cell model. Nevertheless, liver tissues from autopsy of patients who died of DHF showed scant changes of ER membrane structures and rare particles of virions in hepatocytes, despite overwhelming evidence for the presence of viral antigens and RNA-indicating active virus replication. Instead hepatocytes contained an abundance of steatotic vesicles and structural damages. This lack of structural changes indicative of virus replication in human hepatocytes is discussed.																					WOS:000549497200009	31013708

The experimental subunit vaccine was prepared from purified glycoprotein subunits isolated from outer envelopes of the influenza viruses, types A/Singapore/6/86 H1N1, A1/Peking/353/89 H3N2 and B/Hamagota/45/90. Antigens were adsorbed on the adjuvant A1(OH)3, dissolved in 100 mmol/l of PBS. The finalconcentration of the adjuvant in the vaccine was 5 mg/ml. The haemagglutinating activity of isolated glycoprotein subunits: in the vaccine was 128 HJ/0.1 ml. The samples of purified glycoprotein antigens, isolated from the above mentioned influenza viruses, with fetal protein concentrations of 0.20, 0.154 and 0.20 mg/ml, had significant haemagglutinating activities of 256 - 512 HJ/0.1 ml. The samples of nondisrupted and purified influenza virions (before the isolation of glycoprotein subunits), with higher total protein concentrations of 0.44, 0.30 and 0.53 mg/ml had haemagglutinating titres from 128 - 256 HJ/0.1 ml. One group of 10 experimental rabbits was immunized with 0.5 ml subunit vaccine (s/c per animal) and revaccinated with the same dose 24 days after the first vaccination. The mean geometric titres of HI antibodies (GMT) log 2/25 mu l) against influenza viruses A/H1N1/, A1/H3N2/ and B in the sera of these experimental rabbits on day 7 after vaccination were 2.5; 2.0 and 2.5; on day 14: 3.5; 3.0 and 3.0; on day 21: 4.0; 3.5 and 3.0; on day 28: 4.5; 4.0 and 3.5. In ?he blood sera of 5 control nonvaccinated rabbits, virusneutralizing HI antibodies were not detected. A group of 12 mice was immunized with 0.5 ml of the polyvalent influenza subunit vaccine (sie per animal). The mean geometric titres of HI antibodies (GMT log 2/25 mu l) against influenza viruses type A/H1/N1/, A1/H3/N2/ and B in the sera of immunized mice, on day 21 after vaccination were 4.6; 4.3 and 3.5. In the sera of 7 nonimmunized mice, virusneutralizing HI antibodies were no defected. Seven experimental mice were artificially infected 21 days after vaccination with a suspension (I mi) of the above mentioned types of influenza viruses adapted to mice, with the titre EID 50 = 10-8.5 (for each type) intraperitoneally (i/p) and paranasally (pin). An 7 vaccinated and artificially infected mice survived this infection without any symptoms. A second group of 7 nonvaccinated control mice was artificially infected in the same way. All the animal were taken ill with acute respiratory infection 7 days later and 3 animale died on day 10 of the experiment.																					WOS:000071601400008

Chinese Journal of Veterinary Science				37	6			984	988						2017	2017	Samples suspiciously infected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) were collected from several regions in Henan and detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifteen PRV isolates were successfully isolated by inoculating the PRV-positive samples into the swine testicular (ST) cells. The cells infected with these viruses displayed stable cytopathic effect after 3 passages, and the isolates reached to 105.6 TCID50/0.1 mL-109 TCID50/0.1 mL at the seventh generation. The specific gE gene fragment (429 bp) was amplified by PCR. The 15 isolates were highly pathogenic in Kunming mice, causing skin inflammation and death in all experimentally-infected mice at 120 h after challenge. The NY strain was sensitive to chloroform and trypsin, but resistant to acid, alkali and hot, because it was killed until treated with pH3.0 acid or pH11.0 NaOH for 1 h or heated at 80°C for 1 h, and viral infectivity was not impaired by UV treating for 30 min. The virus was observed to be visible round with a diameter of 110-150 nm by electron microscopy, capsule surface has the fiber protrusion with radiate arrage. All these confirmed that the isolated viruses were PRV.																					CABI:20173224639

T Cells Facilitate Recovery from Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus-Induced Encephalomyelitis in the Absence of Antibody								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				84	9			4556	4568		10.1128/JVI.02545-09				MAY 2010	2010	Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a mosquito-borne RNA virus of the genus Alphavirus that is responsible for a significant disease burden in Central and South America through sporadic outbreaks into human and equid populations. For humans, 2 to 4% of cases are associated with encephalitis, and there is an overall case mortality rate of approximately 1%. In mice, replication of the virus within neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to paralyzing, invariably lethal encephalomyelitis. However, mice infected with certain attenuated mutants of the virus are able to control the infection within the CNS and recover. To better define what role T cell responses might be playing in this process, we infected B cell-deficient mu MT mice with a VEEV mutant that induces mild, sublethal illness in immune competent mice. Infected mu MT mice rapidly developed the clinical signs of severe paralyzing encephalomyelitis but were eventually able to control the infection and recover fully from clinical illness. Recovery in this system was T cell dependent and associated with a dramatic reduction in viral titers within the CNS, followed by viral persistence in the brain. Further comparison of the relative roles of T cell subpopulations within this system revealed that CD4(+) T cells were better producers of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) than CD8(+/-) T cells and were more effective at controlling VEEV within the CNS. Overall, these results suggest that T cells, especially CD4(+) T cells, can successfully control VEEV infection within the CNS and facilitate recovery from a severe viral encephalomyelitis.

J	Main, A. J., Jr.								The epizootiology of some tick-borne arboviral diseases.								Journal of the New York Entomological Society				85				209	211						1977	1977	Knowledge on the epizootiology of Powassan encephalitis, a rare but sometimes fatal infection, is reviewed. It is caused by a virus that was first isolated in Powassan, Ontario, in 1958, and virus isolations from ticks and rodents and antibody in man and wildlife indicate that it is widespread across Canada and the northern USA. Isolations of the virus from Haemaphysalis longicornis Neum. have recently been reported from the USSR. In North America the main vertebrate reservoirs appear to be rodents and carnivores. Research has led to the conclusion that several enzootic cycles occur in the field: arboreal squirrels and Ixodes marxi Banks in the east; medium-sized rodents and carnivores and I. cookei Pack. in the east and midwest; and small and medium-sized mammals and I. spinipalpis Nutt. in the north-west. Trans-stadial but not transovarial passage has been demonstrated in experimentally infected examples of Dermacentor andersoni Stiles.Brief mention is made of Colorado tick fever (the principal vector of which in North America is D. andersoni), the only other known tick-borne disease affecting man in the USA. Data that support suspicions that Lyme arthritis is caused by a virus with an arthropod vector are briefly outlined.

The mouse adaption of human influenza A virus can result in mutations in the HA and other proteins, which is associated with increased virulence in mouse lungs. In this study, a mouse-adapted seasonal H1N1 virus was obtained through serial lung-to-lung passages and had significantly increased virulence and pathogenicity in mice. Genetic analysis indicated that the increased virulence of the mouse-adapted virus was attributed to incremental acquisition of three mutations in the HA protein (T89I, N125T, and D221G). However, the mouse adaption of influenza A virus did not change the specificity and affinity of receptor binding and the pH-dependent membrane fusion of HA, as well as the in vitro replication in MDCK cells. Notably, infection with the mouse adapted virus induced severe lymphopenia and modulated cytokine and chemokine responses in mice. Apparently, mouse adaption of human influenza A virus may change the ability to replicate in mouse lungs, which induces strong immune responses and inflammation in mice. Therefore, our findings may provide new insights into understanding the mechanisms underlying the mouse adaption and pathogenicity of highly virulent influenza viruses.

Intra-thoracically inoculated mosquitoes with confirmed positivity were killed by quick freezing at -80 degrees C, applied to sticky tape, and stored at 28 degrees C with 80 +/- 5% relative humidity (RH). At weekly intervals, five mosquitoes were removed from the tape randomly and assayed individually for detection of viral RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). CHIKV RNA was detected up to 12 weeks in dry mosquitoes by RT-PCR. Virus could not be isolated either in cell culture or in the suckling Swiss-albino mouse system at any stage. This study demonstrated the persistence of CHIKV viral RNA up to 12 weeks when stored at 28 degrees C with RH 80 +/- 5%. This finding will have significance in CHIKV surveillance programs in mosquito populations or field-based studies in countries where maintenance of a cold chain is a concern.

J	Balakrishnan Anukumar; Prajakta Shahir								Chandipura virus infection in mice: the role of toll like receptor 4 in pathogenesis.								BMC Infectious Diseases				12	125			(29 May 2012)	(29 May 2012)						2012	2012	Background: The susceptibility of mice and humans to Chandipura virus infection is age-dependent. Upon experimental infection, mice secrete significant amounts of proinflammatory cytokines. Similarly, children who recover from natural infection with the virus show significant amounts of TNF-alpha production, suggesting that innate immunity plays a major role in the response to Chandipura virus. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are key host molecules involved in innate immune responses in infections. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the role of TLR in the response to Chandipura virus infection. Methods: The mouse monocyte-macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7, and C3H/HeJ mice were used as models. Micro array techniques were used to identify the type of TLR involved in the response to infection. The results were validated by examining TLR expression using flow cytometry and by measuring the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide (NO) in the culture supernatants using bead assays and the Griess method, respectively. The pathogenic role of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was studied in a TLR4 mutant strain of mice-C3H/HeJ and the results compared with those from wild-type mice-C3H/CaJ. The pathogenic effects of NO were studied by treating experimentally infected mice with the NO inhibitor, aminoguanidine (AG). Results: The micro array results showed that TLR4 was regulated after Chandipura virus infection. At high multiplicities of infection (10 MOI), RAW cells up-regulated cell surface expression of TLR4 and secreted significant amounts of TNF-alpha, MCP-1, IL-10 and IL-12 and NO. The survival rate of C3H/HeJ mice was higher than those of wild-type C3H/CaJ mice. The survived C3H/HeJ mice secreted significant quantity of MCP-1 and IFN-gamma cytokines and cleared virus from brain. Similarly, the survival rate of AG-treated mice was higher than those of the untreated controls. Conclusions: Chandipura virus regulates TLR4, which leads to the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and NO by infected RAW cells. Difference in survival rate in TLR4 mutant mice and nitric oxide inhibitor treated mice, confirmed the role of these molecules in disease pathogenesis. The result is significant in clinical management and designing antiviral intervention for Chandipura virus infection.																					CABI:20123204886

The effects of inoculation with L. infantum in different species.-The parasite is transmissible by inoculation to the dog, monkey, mouse, rat, and with less ease to the guineapig and rabbit. It is preferable to inoculate into either the peritoneum or the liver; a considerable dose should be given. Subcutaneous inoculation generally fails. Inoculations with cultures containing the flagellate stage of the parasite are less successful than inoculations with the parasite as it occurs in the body. The parasites lose virulence under cultivation. Although young dogs are generally more easily infected than old ones, this is not always the case. The parasite can be carried on in series in dogs. The symptoms in dogs may be very slight, and a diagnosis can only be made by the discovery of the parasite. Spontaneous recovery may occur and immunity may be thereby acquired, but if a dog be re-inoculated before recovery is complete, a more severe infection often results.The author gives a summary of 25 successful inoculations, some of which were made in Tunis by NICOLLE and some by himself in Paris.In infected dogs the spleen is enlarged, the bone marrow is often red and diffluent, but the liver presents a normal appearance. The parasites are generally more numerous in the bone marrow than in the spleen.The facts with regard to the experimental infection of monkeys closely resemble those already referred to in the dog. Contrary to what might be supposed, passage through monkeys produces no exaltation of virulence but a rapid attenuation. In monkeys the symptoms are more pronounced than in dogs.In mice inoculated intraperitoneally the infection sometimes remains restricted to the peritoneum, but in other cases it becomes generalized. As with the other species referred to, inoculation with cultures of the flagellate generally fails, the parasites being promptly destroyed by phagocytes.Inoculation of guineapigs fails more generally than it succeeds, and the same holds good for the rabbit.A single natural case of the infection in the cat has been published, but experimental infection has up to the present failed completely.Birds, lizards, and frogs have also resisted experimental inoculation.

The disease was characterised by a respiratory disorder of variable severity ranging from mild upper respiratory tract illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome, severe interstitial pneumonia and death. The source of the virus is yet to be confirmed but wild animals sold at wholesale seafood and exotic animal markets of Wuhan were implicated. The virus was called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease designated as Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). As of the 13 January 2021, the WHO had reported 90 335 008 cases and 1 954 336 deaths in 216 countries. The isolation of related coronaviruses from bats suggests that they may be a potential host species. This paper is a review of the current literature on SARS-CoV-2 infections of animals and the animal challenge models for the in-vivo evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics.

The infected animals were sacrificed at different times and spleen non-adherent cells were obtained through ficoll-hypaque gradient and depletion of glass-adherent cells. Immunosuppression was observed in rabies virus infected mice correlated with lower NK activity in clinically ill animals. Higher NK activity and percentual of survival were observed in the group submitted to P. acnes. The increased survival correlated with higher NK activity induced by P. acnes suggests a protective role of this natural barrier against rabies virus infection in mice. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Despite a host range restricted to primates, experimental infection of rodents with certain genetically well defined poliovirus strains produces neurological disease. The outcome of infection of mice with mouse-adapted poliovirus strains has been described previously mainly in terms of paralysis and death, and it was generally assumed that these strains produce the same disease syndromes in normal mice and in mice transgenic for the human poliovirus receptor (hPVR-tg mice). We report a comparison of the clinical course and the histopathological features of neurological disease resulting from intracerebral virus inoculation in normal mice with those of murine poliomyelitis in hPVR-tg mice. The consistent pattern of clinical deficits in poliomyelitic transgenic mice contrasted with highly variable neurologic disease that developed in mice infected with different mouse-adapted polioviruses. Histopathological analysis showed a diffuse encephalomyelitis induced by specific poliovirus serotype 2 isolates in normal mice, that affected neuronal cell populations without discrimination, whereas in hPVR-tg animals, damage was restricted to spinal motor neurons. Mouse neurovirulent strains of poliovirus type 2 differed from mouse neurovirulent poliovirus type 1 derivatives in their ability to induce CNS lesions. Our findings indicate that the characteristic clinical appearance and highly specific histopathological features of poliomyelitis are mediated by the hPVR. Our data lead us to conclude that the tissue tropism of mouse-adapted poliovirus strains in normal mice is fundamentally different from that of poliovirus in hPVR-tg mice and primates, and that this is indicative of an as yet unknown mechanism of adsorption and uptake of the virus into cells of the murine CNS.

While fruit bats are considered a natural reservoir, the involvement of other species in the EBOV transmission cycle is unclear, especially for domesticated animals. Dogs and pigs are so far the only domestic animals identified as species that can be infected with EBOV. In 2009 Reston-EBOV was the first EBOV reported to infect swine with indicated transmission to humans; and a survey in Gabon found over 30% seroprevalence for EBOV in dogs during the Ebola outbreak in 2001-2002. While infections in dogs appear to be asymptomatic, pigs experimentally infected with EBOV can develop clinical disease, depending on the virus species and possibly the age of the infected animals. In the experimental settings, pigs can transmit Zaire-Ebola virus to naive pigs and macaques; however, their role during Ebola outbreaks in Africa needs to be clarified. Attempts at virus and antibody detection require as a prerequisite validation of viral RNA and antibody detection methods especially for pigs, as well as the development of a sampling strategy. Significant issues about disease development remain to be resolved for EBOV. Evaluation of current human vaccine candidates or development of veterinary vaccines de novo for EBOV might need to be considered, especially if pigs or dogs are implicated in the transmission of an African species of EBOV to humans.

Experimental Encephalomyocarditis Virus Infection in Small Laboratory Rodents								JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PATHOLOGY				144	1			25	40		10.1016/j.jcpa.2010.05.001				JAN 2011	2011	Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) is a cardiovirus that belongs to the family Picornaviridac. EMCV is an important cause of acute myocarditis in piglets and of fetal death or abortion in pregnant sows. Small rodents, especially rats, have been suspected to be reservoir hosts or carriers. This virus also induces type 1 diabetes mellitus, encephalomyelitis, myocarditis, orchitis and/or sialodacryoadenitis in small laboratory rodents. This paper reviews the pathology and pathogenesis of experimental infection with EMCV in small laboratory rodents. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

When compared with virus isolation, the antigen detection EIA was both sensitive and specific: 44 of 45 (97.7%) liver homogenates and 38 of 41 (92.7%) spleen homogenates that were culture positive and tested by both techniques were positive for viral antigen, while 85 of 87 (97.7%) culture-negative liver homogenates and 66 of 66 culture-negative spleen homogenates were found to be antigen negative. The assay, initially developed to detect antigens of prototype African strains of Ebola virus, reliably detected related strains of Ebola virus found during two recent outbreaks of Ebola virus infection among imported, quarantined Macaca fascicularis monkeys in the United States. The assay allows economical and rapid testing of large numbers of tissue specimens. Antigen was found in homogenates of spleen and liver and in serum.

Mosquitoes were experimentally infected by feeding on viraemic mice or on infected mouse brain suspended in defibrinated chick blood. Normal infant mice were exposed to infected mosquitoes after predetermined extrinsic incubation period. Ife virus persisted for only 1 day in mosquitoes that fed on viraemic mice and for 5 days in those that fed on infected brain/blood suspension. Virus was not recovered in infant mice exposed to infected mosquitoes. However, there was serological evidence of virus transmission manifested as the presence of complement fixing antibody against Ife virus in mice exposed after 2 days and 2-5 days extrinsic incubation periods to mosquitoes infected by feeding on viraemic mice and by feeding on infected brain/blood suspension respectively. This transmission was considered mechanical in view of the short virus persistence and extrinsic incubation periods.																					WOS:A1993LV02100014

An accompanying paper describes the pathologic findings. Following intraperitoneal inoculation of a virulent strain of YF virus, hamsters developed a high-titered viremia (up to 109/mL) lasting 5-6 days and abnormal liver function tests. YF hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies appeared 4 or 5 days after infection, often while viremia was still present. The mortality rate in YF-infected hamsters was variable, depending on the virus strain and the age of the animals. Clinical and pathologic changes in the infected hamsters were very similar to those described in experimentally infected macaques and in fatal human cases of YF, which indicates that the golden hamster may be an excellent alternative animal model, in place of nonhuman primates, for research on the pathogenesis and treatment of YF and other viscerotropic flavivirus diseases.					49th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene49th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Tropical-Medicine-and-Hygiene	OCT 29-NOV 02, 2000OCT 29-NOV 02, 2000	Amer Soc Trop Med & HygAmer Soc Trop Med & Hyg	HOUSTON, TEXASHOUSTON, TEXAS													WOS:000168284200001	11319679

The mortality rate for piglets under 3 weeks old is 100%, but they are usually protected by maternal antibodies. Recently, the risk of an HEV outbreak has increased in the pig industry, because of widely using specific pathogen-free pigs that have no antibodies to HEV. We developed reverse transcription (RT) PCR and nested PCR to detect HEV. Primer sets of polymerase, non-structural protein, and spike protein were designed for RT-PCR and nested PCR based on the nucleotide sequences of the HEV 67N strain. The PCR designated primer sets of spike protein detected only HEV viral RNA among other related nidoviruses. Detection of HEV viral RNA by nested PCR was more sensitive than virus isolation in cell cultures. Nested PCR detected HEV viral RNA from experimentally infected samples of mice and field samples of piglets. The RT-PCR and nested PCR methods to detect HEV is considered a good way to show the HEV etiology on pig farms.																					WOS:000221160000004	15133265	
J	Homberger, FR; Zhang, LN; Barthold, SW								Prevalence of enterotropic and polytropic mouse hepatitis virus in enzootically infected mouse colonies								LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE				48	1			50	54						FEB 1998	1998	Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes the most prevalent viral infection in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies, According to their primary replication site, different strains of MHV segregate into two overlapping biotypes, enterotropic and polytropic. These two groups vary greatly in disease pattern, patho-genicity, immune response, and duration of infection, Historically, the polytropic Mh-Wi strains represent the extensively studied prototype strains that have minimal enterotropism, whereas enterotropic MHV strains have been Ices characterized. Anecdotal reports suggest that most MHV strains encountered today belong to the enterotropic biotype. We have identified 15 isolates of MHV from 19 independent enzootically infected mouse colonies, Sequencing of a variable region of the nucleoprotein (N) gene of each isolate confirmed that all were independent genetic variants. The principal tissue tropism of the new isolates was determined by experimental inoculation of infant mice and examination of intestine, liver, spleen, and brain for lesions. Nine isolates infected only intestine; four isolates infected intestine and liver; one isolate infected intestine, liver, and brain; and one isolate infected liver. These results confirm that the enterotropic MHV biotype is predominant in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies. The MHV biotype features need to he taken into consideration when dealing with MPN infections.																					WOS:000072196000010	9517890

Concurrently, emerging viral diseases, particularly those that are mosquito-borne, have spread dramatically in the past several decades, culminating in outbreaks of several viruses worldwide. Both forms of malnourishment are known to lead to an aberrant immune response, which can worsen disease outcomes and reduce vaccination efficacy for viral pathogens such as influenza and measles. Given the increasing rates of malnutrition and spread of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses), there is an urgent need to understand the role of host nutrition on the infection, virulence, and transmission of these viruses. To address this gap in knowledge, we infected lean, obese, and undernourished mice with arthritogenic arboviruses from the genus Alphavirus and assessed morbidity, virus replication, transmission, and evolution. Obesity and undernourishment did not consistently influence virus replication in the blood of infected animals except for reductions in virus in obese mice late in infection. However, morbidity was increased in obese mice under all conditions. Using Mayaro virus (MAYV) as a model arthritogenic alphavirus, we determined that both obese and undernourished mice transmit virus less efficiently to mosquitoes than control (lean) mice. In addition, viral genetic diversity and replicative fitness were reduced in virus isolated from obese compared to lean controls. Taken together, nutrition appears to alter the course of alphavirus infection and should be considered as a critical environmental factor during outbreaks.

Influenza virus infections prevail worldwide and have been implicated in congenital defects. Infections acquired during gestation may disrupt eye morphogenesis. We investigated the effects of influenza B virus infection on eye malformations during early embryogenesis.Methods: Chick embryos were exposed to influenza B virus at Hamburger-Hamilton stage 9. Maternal infection was conducted by exposing pregnant ICR mice to influenza B virus at the embryonic gestation stage E 5.0. After infection, virus RNA distribution was detected by in situ hybridization at various developmental stages. The distribution of periocular neural crest cells and the extent of apoptosis were examined by immunohistochemical staining, in correlation with eye malformations.Results: Microphthalmos and anophthalmos, together with neural tube defects, were found in the chick and mouse embryos following the infections. The viral RNA was detected in the head neuroepithelium, optic vesicle, periocular mesenchyme, and the forming ventricles of the developing brain. Immunohistochemical staining revealed aberrant neural crest distribution and extensive apoptosis in the head surface ectoderm, periocular mesenchyme, and optic vesicle in the chick embryos. Furthermore, transplacental infection was confirmed by the presence of viral RNA in the mouse fetuses, with eye and neural tube defects similar to those found in the chick embryos after experimental infections.Conclusions: Influenza B virus may act as a teratogen to cause aberrant periocular neural crest cell contribution to eye development and extensive apoptosis, resulting in congenital eye malformations.

Molecular characterization of double-stranded RNA virus in Trichomonas vaginalis Egyptian isolates and its association with pathogenicity								PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH				115	10			4027	4036		10.1007/s00436-016-5174-3				OCT 2016	2016	Trichomoniasis is a common human sexually transmitted infection caused by Trichomonas vaginalis. The parasite can be infected with double-stranded RNA viruses (TVV). This viral infection may have important implications on trichomonal virulence and disease pathogenesis. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of T. vaginalis virus among isolates obtained from infected (symptomatic and asymptomatic) women in Ismailia City, Egypt, and to correlate the virus-infected isolates with the clinical manifestations of patients. In addition, the pathogenicity of TVV infected isolates on mice was also evaluated. T. vaginalis isolates were obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic female patients followed by axenic cultivation in Diamond's TYM medium. The presence of T. vaginalis virus was determined from total extraction of nucleic acids (DNA-RNA) followed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Representative samples were inoculated intraperitoneally in female albino/BALB mice to assess the pathogenicity of different isolates. A total of 110 women were examined; 40 (36.3 %) samples were positive for T. vaginalis infection. Of these 40 isolates, 8 (20 %) were infected by TVV. Five isolates contained TVV-2 virus species, and the remaining three isolates were infected with TVV-4 variant. A significant association was found between the presence of TVV and particular clinical manifestations of trichomoniasis. Experimental mice infection showed varying degrees of pathogenicity. This is the first report on T. vaginalis infection by TVV in Egypt. The strong association detected between TVV and particular clinical features of trichomoniasis and also the degree of pathogenicity in experimentally infected mice may indicate a possible clinical significance of TVV infection of T. vaginalis isolates.

Study of antiviral activity of moraprenil phosphates (MPP) against herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV1) in vitro and during experimental infection caused by HSV1 in mice. Materials and methods. Activity of MPP in vitro was tested by the ability to suppress formation of symplasts in VERO cells infected with HSV1, strain VR-3. A series of MPP that suppress virus-induced symplast-formation by 30 times was selected for in vivo experiments. Anti-viral activity of M PP in vivo was studied in HSV-1 infected mice after administration of either prophylaxis or therapy regimens. Results. MPP at the dose of 20 mu g/mice during s/c administration exhibited a pronounced prophylactic-therapeutic effect. Effectiveness of MPP during clinically evident herpes against the background of developing neurologic symptoms was demonstrated for the first time. Visual observation of the mice, that had received MPP as the first clinical symptoms of the disease appeared, has shown that against the background of preparation injection the clinical signs have ceased after 2 - 3 days and did not registered at least for the whole duration of the observation period (14 days). Conclusion. Active herpes infection is accompanied by the increase of FoxP3 expression in thymus was shown. Possible mechanisms of anti-viral effect of M PP are discussed.

A Pandemic Influenza H1N1 Live Vaccine Based on Modified Vaccinia Ankara Is Highly Immunogenic and Protects Mice in Active and Passive Immunizations								PLOS ONE				5	8					e12217	10.1371/journal.pone.0012217				AUG 16 2010	2010	Background: The development of novel influenza vaccines inducing a broad immune response is an important objective. The aim of this study was to evaluate live vaccines which induce both strong humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against the novel human pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, and to show protection in a lethal animal challenge model.Methodology/Principal Findings: For this purpose, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes of the influenza A/California/07/2009 (H1N1) strain (CA/07) were inserted into the replication-deficient modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) virus - a safe poxviral live vector - resulting in MVA-H1-Ca and MVA-N1-Ca vectors. These live vaccines, together with an inactivated whole virus vaccine, were assessed in a lung infection model using immune competent Balb/c mice, and in a lethal challenge model using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice after passive serum transfer from immunized mice. Balb/c mice vaccinated with the MVA-H1-Ca virus or the inactivated vaccine were fully protected from lung infection after challenge with the influenza H1N1 wild-type strain, while the neuraminidase virus MVA-N1-Ca induced only partial protection. The live vaccines were already protective after a single dose and induced substantial amounts of neutralizing antibodies and of interferon-gamma-secreting (IFN-gamma) CD4- and CD8 T-cells in lungs and spleens. In the lungs, a rapid increase of HA-specific CD4- and CD8 T cells was observed in vaccinated mice shortly after challenge with influenza swine flu virus, which probably contributes to the strong inhibition of pulmonary viral replication observed. In addition, passive transfer of antisera raised in MVA-H1-Ca vaccinated immune-competent mice protected SCID mice from lethal challenge with the CA/07 wild-type virus.Conclusions/Significance: The non-replicating MVA-based H1N1 live vaccines induce a broad protective immune response and are promising vaccine candidates for pandemic influenza.

We previously demonstrated major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I-deficient (beta 2m-deficient) mice with an otherwise resistant genotype develop severe demyelination with minimal neurologic disease when chronically infected with TMEV. These studies implicate CD8(+) T cells as the pathogenic cell in the induction of neurologic disease after demyelination. To determine which effector mechanisms of CD8(+) T cells, granule exocytosis or Fas ligand expression, play a role in the development of demyelination and clinical disease, we infected perforin-deficient, lpr (Fas mutation), and gld (Fas ligand mutation) mice with TMEV. Perforin-deficient mice showed viral persistence in the CNS, chronic brain pathology, and demyelination in the spinal cord white matter. Perforin-deficient mice demonstrated severely impaired MHC class I-restricted cytotoxicity against viral epitopes, but normal MHC class II-restricted delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to virus antigen. Despite demyelination, virus-infected perforin-deficient mice showed only minimal neurologic deficits as indicated by clinical disease score, activity monitoring, and footprint analysis. Perforin- and MHC class II-deficient mice (with functional CD8(+) T cells and perforin molecules and an H-2(b) haplotype) had comparable demyelination and genotype, however, only the latter showed severe clinical disease. Gld and lpr mice demonstrated normal TMEV-specific cytotoxicity and maintained resistance to TMEV-induced demyelinating disease. These studies implicate perforin release by CD8(+) T cells as a potential mechanism by which neurologic deficits are induced after demyelination.																					WOS:000075893000024	9736651

Among them, six diaryl ethers (20e, 27e, 28e, 29e, 33e and 35e) demonstrated high in vitro activity (SI > 50) towards at least one of the tested viruses and very low cytotoxicity against human cells. Compound 27e possesses the broadest spectrum of activity towards all tested viruses in the same way as MDL-860 does. The most active derivatives (27e, 29e and 35e) against coxsackievirus B1 were tested in vivo in newborn mice experimentally infected with 20 MLD50, of coxsackievirus B1. Compound 29e showed promising in vivo activity (protection index 26% and 4 days lengthening of mean survival time). QSAR analysis of the sub-stituent effects on the in vitro cytotoxicity (CC50) and anti-viral activity of the nitrobenzonitrile derivatives was carried out and adequate QSAR models for the anti-viral activity of the compounds against poliovirus 1 and coxsackievirus B1 were constructed.

J	Martinat, C; Mena, I; Brahic, M								Theiler's virus infection of primary cultures of bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				76	24			12823	12833		10.1128/JVI.76.24.12823-12833.2002				DEC 2002	2002	Theiler's virus, a murine picornavirus, causes a persistent infection of macrophage/microglial cells in the central nervous systems of SJL/J mice. Viral replication is restricted in the majority of infected cells, whereas a minority of them contain large amounts of viral RNA and antigens. For the present work, we infected primary cultures of bone marrow monocytes/macrophages from SJL/J mice with Theiler's virus. During the first 10 h postinfection (p.i.), infected monocytes/macrophages were round and covered with filopodia and contained large amounts of viral antigens throughout their cytoplasm. Later on, they were large, flat, and devoid of filopodia and they contained only small amounts of viral antigens distributed in discrete inclusions. These two types of infected cells were very reminiscent of the two types of infected macrophages found in the spinal cords of SJL/J mice. At the peak of virus production, the viral yield per cell was approximately 200 times lower than that for BHK-21 cells. Cell death occurred in the culture during the first 24 h p.i. but not thereafter. No infected cells could be detected after 4 days p.i., and the infection never spread to 100% of the cells. This restriction was unchanged by treating the medium at pH 2 but was abolished by treating it with a neutralizing alpha/beta interferon antiserum, indicating a role for this cytokine in limiting virus expression in monocyte/macrophage cultures. The role of alpha/beta interferon was confirmed by the observation that monocytes/macrophages from IFNA/BR-/- mice were fully permissive.																					WOS:000179344800042	12438607

Summaries of Reports of the All-union Conference of Workers in Microbiology, Epidemiology and infectious Diseases. Moscow, 25th-31st January 1939.								142 pp.	142 pp.						1939	1939	One section of these reports (pp. 91-138) is devoted to diseases transmitted by Arthropods. Localities are not mentioned in those dealing with the vectors of the so-called taiga or spring-summer encephalitis, but there is some evidence in clinical papers of this series that it is confined to the Russian Far East [cf. also R.A.E., B 27 69]. The taiga is the type of primeval forest that occurs in Siberia. In The Role of the Parasitological Factor in the Epidemiology of the Spring and Summer Encephalitis (pp. 94-95), E. N. Pavlovskii states that recent investigations by various workers, including those mentioned below, have shown that three ticks, Ixodes persukatus Schulze, Dermacentor silvarum Olen., and Haemaphysalis concinna Koch, are vectors of this disease [cf. 27 70]. Naturally infected ticks were taken in localities in which cases of the disease occurred, and some of them were collected on rodents, domestic animals and a thrush. In experiments, nymphs and adults of D. silvarum that had fed in the larval stage on infected mice transmitted the disease by biting, and the virus was present in larvae of D. silvarum and J. persulcatus that were the offspring of naturally infected females. Experiments with suspensions of different organs of H. concinna showed that the virus circulates in the body of the tick and concentrates in the salivary glands, being probably transmitted to man through the saliva.In The Tick Ixodes persulcatus as Transmitter of the Taiga Encephalitis (pp. 100-101), A. K. Shubladze & G. V. Serdyukova state that in experiments in which 38 groups of naturally infected examples of this tick collected in endemic foci were fed on mice, encephalitis resulted in five cases after the ticks had fed for at least two days. The disease was also transmitted to mice by artificially infected ticks. Ticks that had fed for two or three days on mice infected with a large dose of the virus conserved it for over 60 days. Infection was also produced in mice by injection of a suspension of larvae that hatched from eggs laid by females collected in an endemic focus.In The Identity of the Virus present in Pasture Ticks with the Virus of Taiga (Spring-Summer) epidemic Encephalitis (pp. 101-102), N. V. Ruizhov states that a virus isolated by him in 1937 from mice on which ticks taken in the field were allowed to feed proved to be identical with the virus of human taiga encephalitis. Seven strains isolated in 1938 by intracerebral inoculation of mice with a suspension of naturally infected ticks did not differ from the virus isolated in the preceding year.In The Tick Dermacentor silvarum as Transmitter of the Taiga Encephalitis (pp. 109-110), N. V. Ruizhov & A. N. Skruinnik record experiments on transmission of the disease by artificially infected examples of this tick that were the offspring of females collected in the field or on cattle. The virus was detected in, and transmitted to mice by, both nymphs and adult females that had fed as larvae on infected mice, and was also detected in adult females that had been fed on healthy mice in the larval and infected mice in the nymphal stage. When infected by nymphs, the duration of the incubation period in mice was inversel)' proportionate to the number of ticks that fed on them.In The Tick-borne Spotted Typhus (pp. 114-118), M. K. Yatzimirs-kaya-Krontovskaya gives a brief survey of the different types of typhus-group fevers and states that outbreaks of diseases, of which some had the clinical characters of the group of tropical typhus and others those of the group of spotted fevers [cf. 24 154], occurred in 1935-38 in the south and east of the Russian Union. The symptoms of a disease studied by the author, which was apparently a form of tropical typhus of the type of tsutsugamushi disease, are outlined; it was prevalent in spring and early summer, though isolated cases were observed in August-September. Investigations showed that the tick, Dermacenior nuttalli Olen., the adults of which attack cattle, was a vector, and that the peak of the infection coincided with the maximum abundance of this tick in nature. It was the only species present in a focus of the disease, where it was found in a part of the steppe used for grazing cattle. Most of the persons infected had worked in the field or the steppe, and evidence of tick-bites was invariably present. In transmission experiments, infection was produced in healthy animals by the bites of infected larvae or adult ticks. Different strains of the virus were obtained from ticks taken in the field and on man, as well as on Citellus and rats. These strains have been maintained by passages through ticks for a period of over 7 months. Evidence has been obtained that the virus may be preserved in rats for over 60 days.In Marseilles Spotted Fever in the Crimea (pp. 118-119), A. Ya. Aluimov states that the first cases of Marseilles fever in the Russian Union were observed by him in the Crimea in 1936, and that the disease has since occurred sporadically in a number of localities. The virus has been isolated from patients and from examples of the tick, Rhipi-cephalus sanguineus Latr., collected in different localities. This species, which usually attacks dogs, is widely distributed in the Crimea. In the course of a study of the blood of dogs, a positive Weil-Felix reaction was obtained. Since R. sanguineus is also present in various parts of the Caucasus and Central Asia, it is possible that Marseilles fever also occurs in these areas.In The Excreta of Lice infected with Spotted Typhus as a Source of the Transmission of the Virus per os from diseased to healthy Lice (pp. 124-125), A. V. Pshenichnov states that, in laboratory experiments, the virus of typhus was present in the excreta of lice [Peaiculus humanus L.] 7 days after infection, and was particularly virulent 2-5 days later. In excreta of infected lice occurring on the underwear and skin of people immune from the disease, the virus preserved its virulence for at least 10 days. It appears that lice are as likely to become infected by feeding on skin soiled with virulent excreta as by feeding on persons suffering from the disease. In previous experiments by the author, healthy lice became infected after feeding on skin that had been contaminated with crushed infected lice. The author suggests that the excreta of lice may preserve the virus in nature between epidemics [cf. 27 60].In The Role of the Parasitological Factor in the Epidemiology of Tularaemia (pp. 132-134), N. G. Olsuf'ev points out that recent investigations in the Russian Union have shown that the ticks of the genus Ixodes are among the chief vectors of tularaemia. If infected with Bacterium tularense they harbour it throughout their life, they transmit it easily to rodents, sheep, camels and pigs, and they have been found infected in nature. Infected fleas (Ctenophthalmus) and Gamasid mites have been found in nests of rodents [cf. 23 85], and in preliminary experiments mites that had fed on diseased mice preserved the bacterium for 30 hours. Other experimental vectors are Cimex lectulariits L. [24 146], lice of thegenus Hoplopleura [25 176] and Tabanids [26 11]. Tabanids were able to transmit the disease for 48-72 hours after feeding on a diseased animal or its carcass; they also transmitted it after they had had contact with water in which the decomposing carcass of a diseased rodent had been kept for a lengthy period. Spontaneously infected Tabanids occurred in the field. Stomoxys calcitrans L., was able to transmit the disease for 24-48 hours after the infecting feed, and the bacterium was preserved in its internal organs for up to a week. In other experiments, mosquitos of the genera Ae'des, Anopheles and Mansonia were able to harbour the infection for periods of over a month [cf. 23 290; 25 275] and readily transmitted it by biting to sheep and rodents. The latter also contracted the disease when infected mosquitos were crushed on their unscarified skin.

J	Alber, DG; Vallance, P; Powell, KL								Enhanced atherogenesis is not an obligatory response to systemic herpesvirus infection in the ApoE-deficient mouse - Comparison of murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 and herpes simplex virus-1								ARTERIOSCLEROSIS THROMBOSIS AND VASCULAR BIOLOGY				22	5			793	798		10.1161/01.ATV.0000016046.94521.68				MAY 2002	2002	Viral and bacterial infectious agents have been implicated in the etiology of atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that a gamma-herpesvirus can accelerate atherosclerosis in the apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mouse. To address whether a virally induced systemic immune response is sufficient to trigger enhanced atheroma formation, we infected apoE-/- mice with murine gamma-herpesvirus-68 (MHV-68) or herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). In this study, we show that both viruses were able to induce a cell-mediated and humoral immune response in the apoE-/- mouse, which was sustained over a period of 24 weeks. Although intranasal or intraperitoneal infection with MHV-68 induced similar levels Of virus-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies in the serum of apoE-/- mice, those infected with HSV-1 showed higher anti-HSV-1 IgG2a compared with IgG1 antibody levels. In addition, viral message was not detected in the aortas of HSV-1-infected animals, whereas we have shown previously that MHV-68 mRNA can be detected in the aortas of infected mice as early as 5 days after infection. Compared with control mice, apoE-/- mice infected with MHV-68 showed accelerated atherosclerosis, whereas mice infected with HSV-1 did not. These data indicate that a systemic immune response to any particular infectious agent is insufficient to induce enhanced atherosclerosis in the apoE-/- mouse and point to specific infections or immune mechanisms that might be essential for virally enhanced atherogenesis.

Tula Virus Infections in the Eurasian Water Vole in Central Europe								VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES				12	6			503	513		10.1089/vbz.2011.0784				JUN 2012	2012	Recent reports of novel hantaviruses in shrews and moles and the detection of rodent-borne hantaviruses in different rodent species raise important questions about their host range and specificity, evolution, and host adaptation. Tula virus (TULV), a European hantavirus, is believed to be slightly or non-pathogenic in humans and was initially detected in the common vole Microtus arvalis, the East European vole M. levis (formerly rossiaemeridionalis), and subsequently in other Microtus species. Here we report the first multiple RT-PCR detection and sequence analyses of TULV in the Eurasian water vole Arvicola amphibius from different regions in Germany and Switzerland. Additional novel TULV S-, M-, and L-segment sequences were obtained from M. arvalis and M. agrestis trapped in Germany at sites close to trapping sites of TULV-RT-PCR-positive water voles. Serological investigations using a recombinant TULV nucleocapsid protein revealed the presence of TULV-reactive antibodies in RT-PCR-positive and a few RT-PCR-negative water voles. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a geographical clustering of the novel S-, M-, and L-segment sequences from A. amphibius with those of M. arvalis- and M. agrestis-derived TULV lineages, and may suggest multiple TULV spillover or a potential host switch to A. amphibius. Future longitudinal studies of sympatric Microtus and Arvicola populations and experimental infection studies have to prove the potential of A. amphibius as an additional TULV reservoir host.

It is not entirely clear whether CD4+ T-cell help is necessary for establishing anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses that successfully control liver infection. To address the role of CD4+ T cells in acute viral hepatitis, we infected mice with Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV) of the strain WE; LCMV-WE causes acute hepatitis in mice and is cleared from the liver by CD8+ T cells within about two weeks. The role of CD4+ T-cell help was studied in CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice, which were either induced by genetic deficiency of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) in CIITA&#8722;/&#8722; mice, or by antibody-mediated CD4+ cell depletion. We found that CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice developed protracted viral liver infection, which seemed to be a consequence of reduced virus-specific CD8+ T-cell numbers in the liver. Moreover, the anti-viral effector functions of the liver-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in response to stimulation with LCMV peptide, notably the IFN-&#947; production and degranulation capacity were impaired in CIITA&#8722;/&#8722; mice. The impaired CD8+ T-cell function in CIITA&#8722;/&#8722; mice was not associated with increased expression of the exhaustion marker PD-1. Our findings indicate that CD4+ T-cell help is required to establish an effective antiviral CD8+ T-cell response in the liver during acute viral infection. Insufficient virus control and protracted viral hepatitis may be consequences of impaired initial CD4+ T-cell help.																					DRCI:DATA2016093008796019

Impaired Clearance of Influenza A Virus in Obese, Leptin Receptor Deficient Mice Is Independent of Leptin Signaling in the Lung Epithelium and Macrophages								PLOS ONE				9	9					e108138	10.1371/journal.pone.0108138				SEP 18 2014	2014	Rationale: During the recent H1N1 outbreak, obese patients had worsened lung injury and increased mortality. We used a murine model of influenza A pneumonia to test the hypothesis that leptin receptor deficiency might explain the enhanced mortality in obese patients.Methods: We infected wild-type, obese mice globally deficient in the leptin receptor (db/db) and non-obese mice with tissue specific deletion of the leptin receptor in the lung epithelium (SPC-Cre/LepR(fl/fl)) or macrophages and alveolar type II cells (LysM-Cre/Lepr(fl/fl)) with influenza A virus (A/WSN/33 [H1N1]) (500 and 1500 pfu/mouse) and measured mortality, viral clearance and several markers of lung injury severity.Results: The clearance of influenza A virus from the lungs of mice was impaired in obese mice globally deficient in the leptin receptor (db/db) compared to normal weight wild-type mice. In contrast, non-obese, SP-C-Cre(+/+)/LepR(fl/fl) and LysM-Cre(+/+)/LepR(fl/fl) had improved viral clearance after influenza A infection. In obese mice, mortality was increased compared with wildtype mice, while the SP-C-Cre(+/+)/LepR(fl/fl) and LysM-Cre(+/+)/LepR(fl/fl) mice exhibited improved survival.Conclusions: Global loss of the leptin receptor results in reduced viral clearance and worse outcomes following influenza A infection. These findings are not the result of the loss of leptin signaling in lung epithelial cells or macrophages. Our results suggest that factors associated with obesity or with leptin signaling in non-myeloid populations such as natural killer and T cells may be associated with worsened outcomes following influenza A infection.

Experimental infection of laboratory rats with a rodent hepacivirus isolated from Rar(us norvegicus (RHV) is a promising surrogate model due to its recapitulation of HCV-like chronicity. However, several aspects of rat RHV infection remain unclear, for instance, how RHV evades host adaptive immunity to establish persistent infection. Here, we analyzed the induction, differentiation, and functionality of RHV-specific CD8 T cell responses that are essential for protection against viral persistence. Virus-specific CD8 T cells targeting dominant and subdominant major histocompatibility complex class I epitopes proliferated considerably in liver after RHV infection. These populations endured long term yet never acquired antiviral effector functions or selected for viral escape mutations. This was accompanied by the persistent upregulation of programmed cell death-1 and absent memory cell formation, consistent with a dysfunctional phenotype. Remarkably, transient suppression of RHV viremia with a direct-acting antiviral led to the priming of CD8 T cells with partial effector function, driving the selection of a viral escape variant. These data demonstrate an intrinsic abnormality within CD8 T cells primed by rat RHV infection, an effect that is governed at least partially by the magnitude of early virus replication. Thus, this model could be useful in investigating mechanisms of CD8 T cell subversion, leading to the persistence of hepatotropic pathogens such as HCV.IMPORTANCE Development of vaccines against hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of cirrhosis and cancer, has been stymied by a lack of animal models. The recent discovery of an HCV-like rodent hepacivirus (RHV) enabled the development of such a model in rats. This platform recapitulates HCV hepatotropism and viral chronicity necessary for vaccine testing. Currently, there are few descriptions of RHV-specific responses and why they fail to prevent persistent infection in this model. Here, we show that RHV-specific CD8 T cells, while induced early at high magnitude, do not develop into functional effectors capable of controlling virus. This defect was partially alleviated by short-term treatment with an HCV antiviral. Thus, like HCV, RHV triggers dysfunction of virus-specific CD8 T cells that are vital for infection resolution. Additional study of this evasion strategy and how to mitigate it could enhance our understanding of hepatotropic viral infections and lead to improved vaccines and therapeutics.

It has also been found that virus is highly concentrated in the central nervous system, whilst intracranial infection has proved to be a satisfactory route of experimental infection.Virus was recovered from rats one to two weeks after intraperitoneal infection, though the animals showed no visible reaction. Guinea pigs, similarly treated, sometimes showed a febrile reaction whilst rabbits usually showed a noticeable fever, particularly with " passaged " virus. Fresh sheep virus was less effective in this respect.Following inoculation with heart-water virus, rats and guineapigs invariably gave negative Weil-Felix reactions [i.e. agglutination of Proteus (X19), a phenomenon diagnostic for the rickettsial infection of human typhus].Virus was preserved in a virulent state for as long as 22 days by storing infected brain tissue at -15°C.-E.

Animals which have recovered from the disease display a state of immunity which may persist for a long period (over 2 years in some animals) but will not last indefinitely. All of the guinea-pigs were found to resist a challenging inoculation performed 1-5 months after the disease. The spontaneous occurrence of typhus in the guinea-pig has not been recorded. When kept together with guinea-pigs in which typhus has been induced experimentally, normal animals do not contract the disease. The disease could not be induced by experimental traumatization or inoculation of virulent germs to guinea-pigs which had suffered from the disease 60-90 days previously. Out of several thousand inoculated guinea-pigs, only three had relapses 24-48 hours after the subsidence of fever. The distribution of Rickettsia prowazeki in the body of experimentally infected guinea-pigs was investigated. Various viscera were collected from animals sacrificed during the feverish period, and their infectiousness was separately tested. The lung was found to display the highest degree of infectiousness. Guinea-pigs subjected to dietary imbalance do not acquire immunity against experimental typhus. Such animals were repeatedly liable to contract the disease (three times). Guinea-pigs fed on a complete diet were immune to re-inoculation of the virus once they had recovered from the first infection. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19613600017876

Isolation and preliminary characterization of a virus from natural and experimentally produced cases of bovine emphemeral fever								ONDESTEPOORT J VET RES				34	(1)			29	40						1967	1967	Five immunologically identical strains of virus were isolated from naturally and experimentally produced cases of ephemeral fever, by the intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice with infective buffy coat suspension. The prototype strain was sodium desoxycholate and ether sensitive. Specific neutralizing antibodies were demonstrated in the convalescent sera of both naturally and experimentally infected cattle. Serial passage of the virus in suckling mice resulted in a very rapid loss of pathogenicity for cattle with a corresponding loss of immunogenicity. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19684900063443	4963884

Recently, a H9N2 bat influenza A virus was found in Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus), raising the question of whether this bat species is a suitable host for IAV. Here, we studied the susceptibility, pathogenesis and transmission of avian and bat-related H9N2 viruses in this new host. In a first experiment, we oronasally inoculated six Egyptian fruit bats with an avian-related H9N2 virus (A/layer chicken/Bangladesh/VP02-plaque/2016 (H9N2)). In a second experiment, six Egyptian fruit bats were inoculated with the newly discovered bat-related H9N2 virus (A/bat/Egypt/381OP/2017 (H9N2)). While R. aegyptiacus turned out to be refractory to an infection with H9N2 avian-type, inoculation with the bat H9N2 subtype established a productive infection in all inoculated animals with a detectable seroconversion at day 21 post-infection. In conclusion, Egyptian fruit bats are most likely not susceptible to the avian H9N2 subtype, but can be infected with fruit bat-derived H9N2. H9-specific sero-reactivities in fruit bats in the field are therefore more likely the result of contact with a bat-adapted H9N2 strain.																					WOS:000643769900001	33919890

Histomorphological changes in the structure of different organs such as hyperplasia of vessel walls, lymphohistiocytic infiltrations are revealed. The detection of the infectious HFRS virus in the lungs, salivary glands, kidneys, intestine during 90-360 days confirms the duration and shows ways of virus excretion into the environment. The infection course is wavy and virus excretion to the environment is different in various periods. The experiments on the combined maintenance of the naturally induced red mice have shown that infection of rodents may follow the contact and air-drop ways. The vertical transmission way is, evidently, insignificant. The role of ectoparasites in the HFRS infection transmission is not revealed.																					BCI:BCI198784120202	2907924

Infection with the virus is a fatal disease; no vaccine is available and prevention depends on interruption of the chain of transmission. The study of dengue viral transmission by mosquitoes is hindered due to the lack of an affordable animal model. In general, immuno-competent mice are used as a simple and inexpensive animal model, but mice are not susceptible to dengue virus infection and therefore viremia will not occur following the inoculation of the virus in such mice. Here, we report a method for creating artificial viremia in immuno-competent mice, and further demonstrate the use of viremic mice to simultaneously infect a large number of Aedes aegypti.Methods: We infected K562 cells with DENV-2 in the presence of an antibody against DENV-4. We then incubated the cells for 2 d before injecting the infected cells into C3H mice. After 5 h incubation, we allowed 100-150 female Aedes aegypti to feed on blood from the mice directly. We collected blood samples from the mice and from randomly selected Ae. aegypti at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-blood meal and screened the samples for DENV-2 genome as well as for virus concentration.Results: Our procedure provided high virus concentrations in the mice for at least 7 h after viral inoculation. We found that 13 out of 14 randomly picked mosquitoes were infected with DENV-2. High concentrations of virus were detected in the mosquitoes until at least 12 h post-infection.Conclusions: Using the viremic immuno-competent mouse, we show that mass infection of Ae. aegypti is achievable. Compared to other infection techniques using direct inoculation, membrane-feeding, or immuno-deficient/humanized mice, we are confident that this method will provide a simpler and more efficient infection technique.

Deficient IFN Signaling by Myeloid Cells Leads to MAVS-Dependent Virus-Induced Sepsis								PLOS PATHOGENS				10	4					e1004086	10.1371/journal.ppat.1004086				APR 2014	2014	The type I interferon (IFN) signaling response limits infection of many RNA and DNA viruses. To define key cell types that require type I IFN signaling to orchestrate immunity against West Nile virus (WNV), we infected mice with conditional deletions of the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) gene. Deletion of the Ifnar gene in subsets of myeloid cells resulted in uncontrolled WNV replication, vasoactive cytokine production, sepsis, organ damage, and death that were remarkably similar to infection of Ifnar(-/-) mice completely lacking type I IFN signaling. In Mavs(-/-) xIfnar(-/-) myeloid cells and mice lacking both Ifnar and the RIG-I-like receptor adaptor gene Mavs, cytokine production was muted despite high levels of WNV infection. Thus, in myeloid cells, viral infection triggers signaling through MAVS to induce proinflammatory cytokines that can result in sepsis and organ damage. Viral pathogenesis was caused in part by massive complement activation, as liver damage was minimized in animals lacking complement components C3 or factor B or treated with neutralizing anti-C5 antibodies. Disease in Ifnar(-/-) and CD11c Cre(+)Ifnar(f/f) mice also was facilitated by the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha, as blocking antibodies diminished complement activation and prolonged survival without altering viral burden. Collectively, our findings establish the dominant role of type I IFN signaling in myeloid cells in restricting virus infection and controlling pathological inflammation and tissue injury.

First published September 11, 2009; doi: 10.1152/ajplung.00150.2009.-Viral infection is associated with approximately one-half of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which in turn, accelerate disease progression. In this study, we infected mice exposed to a combination of elastase and LPS, a constituent of cigarette smoke and a risk factor for development of COPD, with rhinovirus serotype 1B, and examined animals for viral persistence, airway resistance, lung volume, and cytokine responses. Mice exposed to elastase and LPS once a week for 4 wk showed features of COPD such as airway inflammation and obstruction, goblet cell metaplasia, reduced lung elastance, increased total lung volume, and increased alveolar chord length. In general, mice exposed to elastase or LPS alone showed intermediate effects. Compared with rhinovirus (RV)-infected PBS-exposed mice, RV-infected elastase/LPS-exposed mice showed persistence of viral RNA, airway hyperresponsiveness, increased lung volume, and sustained increases in expression of TNF alpha, IL-5, IL-13, and muc5AC (up to 14 days postinfection). Furthermore, virus-induced IFNs, interferon response factor-7, and IL-10 were deficient in elastase/LPS-treated mice. Mice exposed to LPS or elastase alone cleared virus similar to PBS-treated control mice. We conclude that limited exposure of mice to elastase/LPS produces a COPD-like condition including increased persistence of RV, likely due to skewing of the immune response towards a Th2 phenotype. Similar mechanisms may be operative in COPD.																					WOS:000271141600017	19748999

Recently we infected newborn mice by inoculating HTLV-1-producing human cells, and found that T-cells, B-cells and granulocytes were infected in vivo. To understand the mechanism of viral-cell interaction and the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 using the mouse model, it is important to clarify the cellular tropism using a cell-free HTLV-1 transmission system. We employed a highly transmissible cell-free HTLV-1 produced by a feline kidney cell line, c77, and studied the susceptibility of 9 kinds of mouse cell lines, EL4, RLm1, CTLL-2, J774.1, DA-1, Ba/F3, WEHI-3, NIH3T3 and B1, and two kinds of human cell lines, Molt-4 and Hut78, HTLV-1 proviral sequence was found by PCR in all 9 mouse cell lines as well as in 2 human cell lines and viral entry was blocked with sera from an HTLV-1 carrier and an adult T-cell leukemia patient. Unexpectedly, mouse cell lines EL4 and RLm1 and human cell lines Molt-4 and Hut78 showed similar efficiency for viral entry. These results suggest a,vide distribution of HTLV-1 receptor in mouse cells.																					WOS:000168309600006	11346463

Compared efficacy of local passive immunoprophylaxis and chemioprophylaxis against influenza A virus pneumonia in mice								Abstracts of the General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology				101				28	29						2001	2001	Influenza is one of the main viral diseases in human. The whole communities are concerned by this virus, with an increased incidence in elderly and in immunocompromised patients. Chemical anti viral compounds, as amantadine and zanamivir, are available for treatment. The main risk of these treatments is the emergence of resistant strains. Local passive immunoprophylaxis with human polyclonal or human monoclonal antibodies could be an alternative way of prevention. The aim of this work was to evaluate and to compare the efficacy of passive local immunoprophylaxis with polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies and chemioprophylaxis in mice infected with a lethal dose of influenza A virus. The viral strain used was influenza A virus ((A/Scotland/74 (H3N2)) adapted to mice by serial lung passages. For immunoprophylaxis: Groups of 10 BALB/c mice received respectively a single dose of: - IvIg at the regimen of 3.7, 7.5, 15, 30 or 60 mg/kg, - F(ab')2 fragments (3, 6, 15 or 30 mg/kg), - One mg/kg of human monoclonal antibodies. For chemioprophylaxis, Zanamivir (GlaxoWellcome laboratories, France) was administered twice a day intranasally, since one day before experimental infection to five days after, at the dose of 25 mg/kg. Amantadine (Du Pont Merck Pharma, Quebec) was administered orally, since one day before experimental infection to five days after, at the dose of 600 mg/kg, once a day. Mice were fully protected by a single dose of 500 mug of IvIg administered 3 days before challenge. Identical result was obtained with 150 mug of F(ab')2 fragments but only when administered 24 hours before challenge. Human monoclonal antibodies protected 83% of the animals. Zanamivir or Amantadine were successful only with daily repeated drugs administration. These results show the interest of local passive immunoprophylaxis to protect non immunized mice against a lethal viral infection. This easy way of administration could be evaluated in humans and considered as a complement for vaccination in case of outbreaks in human population.					101st General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology101st General Meeting of the American Society for Microbiology	May 20-24, 2001May 20-24, 2001	American Society for MicrobiologyAmerican Society for Microbiology	Orlando, FL, USAOrlando, FL, USA													BCI:BCI200200176226

Treatment of immunocompromised, influenza virus-infected patients with the viral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir often leads to the emergence of drug-resistant variants. Combination therapy with compounds that target different steps in the viral life cycle may improve treatment outcomes and reduce the emergence of drug-resistant variants.Methods. Here, we infected immunocompromised nude mice with an influenza A virus and treated them with neuraminidase (oseltamivir, laninamivir) or viral polymerase (favipiravir) inhibitors, or combinations thereof.Results. Combination therapy for 28 days increased survival times compared with monotherapy, but the animals died after treatment was terminated. Mono-and combination therapies did not consistently reduce lung virus titers. Prolonged viral replication led to the emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant variants, although viruses remained sensitive to favipiravir. Overall, favipiravir provided greater benefit than neuraminidase inhibitors.Conclusions. Collectively, our data demonstrate that combination therapy in immunocompromised hosts increases survival times, but does not suppress the emergence of neuraminidase inhibitor-resistant variants.

We have utilized commercially available oligo-tagged microspheres (Luminex MagPlex-TAG) to construct and evaluate multiplexed assays for the detection and differentiation of Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV). Both these agents are bat-borne zoonotic paramyxoviruses of increasing concern for veterinary and human health. Assays were developed targeting multiple sites within the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) encoding genes. The relative specificities and sensitivities of the assays were determined using reference isolates of each virus type, samples from experimentally infected horses, and archival veterinary diagnostic submissions. Results were assessed in direct comparison with an established qPCR. The microsphere array assays achieved unequivocal differentiation of HeV and NiV and the sensitivity of HeV detection was comparable to qPCR, indicating high analytical and diagnostic specificity and sensitivity.

Characterization of non-lethal West Nile Virus (WNV) infection in horses: Subclinical pathology and innate immune response								MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS				103				71	79		10.1016/j.micpath.2016.12.018				FEB 2017	2017	Most natural West Nile virus (WNV) infections in humans and horses are subclinical or sub-lethal and non-encephalitic. Yet, the main focus of WNV research remains on the pathogenesis of encephalitic disease, mainly conducted in mouse models. We characterized host responses during subclinical WNV infection in horses and compared outcomes with those obtained in a novel rabbit model of subclinical WNV infection (Suen et al. 2015. Pathogens, 4: 529). Experimental infection of 10 horses with the newly emerging WNV-strain, WNVNSW2011, did not result in neurological disease in any animal but transcriptional upregulation of both type I and II interferon (IFN) was seen in peripheral blood leukocytes prior to or at the time of viremia. Likewise, transcript upregulation for IFNs, TNF alpha, IL1 beta, CXCL10, TLRs, and MyD88 was detected in lymphoid tissues, while IFN alpha, CXCL10, TLR3, ISG15 and IRF7 mRNA was upregulated in brains with. histopathological evidence of mild encephalitis, but absence of detectable viral RNA or antigen. These responses were reproduced in the New Zealand White rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) experimentally infected with WNVNSW2011, by intradermal footpad inoculation. Kinetics of the anti-WNV antibody response was similar in horses and rabbits, which for both species may be explained by the early IFN and cytokine responses evident in circulating leukocytes and lymphoid organs. Given the similarities to the majority of equine infection outcomes, immunocompetent rabbits appear to represent a valuable small-animal model for investigating aspects of non-lethal WNV infections, notably mechanisms involved in abrogating morbidity.

Detailed studies of these aspects were hampered mostly by the lack of accessible animal models, since only nonhuman primates are susceptible to experimental infections. An alternative animal model would also be of interest to assess the primary replication site and for the evaluation of the safety and efficacy of vaccines. A study was undertaken to determine whether HAV can infect guinea pigs and whether they are useful as a model for studying aspects of HAV pathogenesis and for the evaluation of vaccines. HAV variants adapted to primate or guinea pig tissue culture were used to inoculate guinea pigs intraperitoneally and by the oral route. The animals were observed for clinical disease, shedding of HAV in stools, viremia, seroconversion, evidence for liver damage by biochemical liver function tests, virus presence in the liver, development of hepatic histopathological changes, and occurrence of HAV in extrahepatic organs. The animals developed an active, clinically inapparent infection with specific histopathological changes in the liver. Although virus replication occurred, as shown by RT-PCR and isolation of infectious virus from feces and serum, it seems unlikely that guinea pigs are suitable for studying the clinical features of hepatitis A, because the clinical and laboratory parameters remained normal. However, guinea pigs appear useful for studying some aspects of HAV pathogenesis and for testing the safety of vaccines. J. Med. Virol. 64:402-409, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Mice were inoculated with either T. cruzi, 0.1 median lethal dose (LD50) of coronavirus (mouse hepatitis virus [MHV-3] or virus X), or both pathogens. Levels of parasitemia, mortality, and the extent of pathologic alterations in lymphoid organs were determined. Mice inoculated with T. cruzi had mild alterations in their lymphoid organs and survived infection. In contrast, mice inoculated with both pathogens died, and had significantly higher levels of parasitemia and profound alterations in lymphoid organs. These results indicate that the pathologic profile of T. cruzi infection can be profoundly altered by subclinical infection with coronaviruses.																					WOS:000079087000006	10090092	
J	Sullivan, Christopher S.; Sung, Chang K.; Pack, Christopher D.; Grundhoff, Adam; Lukacher, Aron E.; Benjamin, Thomas L.; Ganem, Don								Murine Polyomavirus encodes a microRNA that cleaves early RNA transcripts but is not essential for experimental infection								VIROLOGY				387	1			157	167		10.1016/j.virol.2009.02.017				APR 25 2009	2009	MicroRNAs are small regulatory RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression and can be encoded by viral as well as cellular genomes. The functions Of most Viral miRNAs are unknown and few have been studied in an in vivo context. Here we show that the murine polyomavirus (PyV) encodes a precursor microRNA that is processed into two mature microRNAs, both of which are active at directing the cleavage of the early PyV mRNAs. Furthermore, we identify a deletion mutant of polyomavirus that is defective in encoding the microRNAs. This mutant replicates normally and transforms Cultured cells with efficiencies comparable to wildtype PyV. The miRNA mutant is competent to establish a transient infection of mice following parenteral inoculation, and is cleared post infection at approximately the same rate as the wildtype virus. In addition, under these laboratory conditions, we observe no differences in anti-viral CD8 T cell responses. These results indicate that PyV miRNA expression is not essential for infection of cultured cells or experimentally inoculated mice, and raise the possibility that its role in natural infection might involve aspects Of acquisition or spread that are not recapitulated by experimental inoculation.

The commitment of infected neurons toward the viral lytic or latent transcriptional program is likely to depend on both viral and cellular factors, and to differ among individual neurons. In this study, we used a mouse model of HSV-1 infection to investigate the relationship between viral genomes and the nuclear environment in terms of the establishment of latency. During acute infection, viral genomes show two major patterns: replication compartments or multiple spots distributed in the nucleoplasm ( namely "multiple-acute"). Viral genomes in the "multiple-acute" pattern are systematically associated with the promyelocytic leukemia ( PML) protein in structures designated viral DNA-containing PML nuclear bodies ( vDCP-NBs). To investigate the viral and cellular features that favor the acquisition of the latency-associated viral genome patterns, we infected mouse primary TG neurons from wild type ( wt) mice or knock-out mice for type 1 interferon ( IFN) receptor with wt or a mutant HSV-1, which is unable to replicate due to the synthesis of a non-functional ICP4, the major virus transactivator. We found that the inability of the virus to initiate the lytic program combined to its inability to synthesize a functional ICP0, are the two viral features leading to the formation of vDCP-NBs. The formation of the "multiple-latency" pattern is favored by the type 1 IFN signaling pathway in the context of neurons infected by a virus able to replicate through the expression of a functional ICP4 but unable to express functional VP16 and ICP0. Analyses of TGs harvested from HSV-1 latently infected humans showed that viral genomes and PML occupy similar nuclear areas in infected neurons, eventually forming vDCP-NB-like structures. Overall our study designates PML protein and PML-NBs to be major cellular components involved in the control of HSV-1 latency, probably during the entire life of an individual.

The animals were sacrificed at different times,when the different tissues were collected and submitted to fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and mouse inoculation test (MIT). The group submitted to vaccination and P. acnes treatment presented a percentage of survival superior to that observed in infected mice only treated with P. acnes. Control infected animals had the lowest survival rates. The distribution of rabies virus in spleen of infected mice, vaccinated and submitted to P. acnes was superior to that verified in infected mice not treated with P. acnes. The increased survival correlated with the distribution of rabies virus in lymphoid tissues, could be interpreted as the consequence of P. acnes activity on macrophages. The results suggest the role of macrophages against rabies virus infection in mice and the importance of vaccination in the post expositive treatment of rabies.

Despite the annual high morbidity and mortality caused by LASF, very little is known about the pathophysiology of the disease. Basic research on LASF has been precluded due to the lack of relevant small animal models that reproduce the human disease. Immunocompetent laboratory mice are resistant to infection with Lassa virus (LASV) and, to date, only immunodeficient mice, or mice expressing human HLA, have shown some degree of susceptibility to experimental infection. Here, transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells into irradiated type I interferon receptor knockout mice (IFNAR(-/-)) was used to generate chimeric mice that reproduced important features of severe LASF in humans. This included high lethality, liver damage, vascular leakage and systemic virus dissemination. In addition, this model indicated that T cell-mediated immunopathology was an important component of LASF pathogenesis that was directly correlated with vascular leakage. Our strategy allows easy generation of a suitable small animal model to test new vaccines and antivirals and to dissect the basic components of LASF pathophysiology.

J	Carty, AJ; Franklin, CL; Riley, LK; Besch-Williford, C								Diagnostic polymerase chain reaction assays for identification of murine polyomaviruses in biological samples								COMPARATIVE MEDICINE				51	2			145	149						APR 2001	2001	Purpose: Mouse polyoma virus and K virus are murine polyomaviruses frequently used in carcinogenicity and cellular biology studies in mice. These viruses can cause persistent infections, which increase the likelihood of transmission through transplantation of cells from infected mice. To identify polyomavirus-infected biological samples, several diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were developed.Methods: Polyomavirus-family and virus-specific PCR assays were designed and optimized for specificity and sensitivity. The generic (polyomavirus-family) PCR assay and mouse polyoma virus-specific assays were compared with the mouse bioassay for diagnosis of infected cellular samples.Results: Specificity of the PCR assays was confirmed by testing a battery of other murine viruses. The mouse polyoma virus PCR test was the most sensitive assay, detecting as few as 2,000 copies of homologous virus. The K virus PCR assay was about eightfold less sensitive, and the generic PCR test was the least sensitive. Mouse polyoma virus and generic PCR assays amplified mouse polyoma virus in the inoculum and tissues from experimentally infected mice, and performed better than did the mouse bioassay,Conclusions: Results of this study confirm that PCR is a specific and sensitive method for detection of murine polyomaviruses in biological samples.

Zhongguo Yufang Shouyi Xuebao				37	1			6	9						Jan 2015	2015	An H10N7 subtype avian influenza virus (AIV) WSP/QHD/660-662/2013 (H10N7) was isolated from life Wood Sandpiper in Qinhuangdao, Hebei province in 2013, and the virus was subject to whole genomic sequencing and pathogenic test in mammalian model of BALB/c mice. The sequence analysis of HA showed that the virus possessed a motif of 334PELMQGRGL343 at the cleavage site of HA protein which categorized the isolate as a low pathogenic Ant. In addition, the HA gene of the isolate shared the highest homologous (97.90%) to that of the AIV A/Duck/Hunan/S11205/2012(H10N3), but the identity of NA gene was the highest (97.46%) to the AIV A/Domestic Duck/Republic of Georgia/1/2010 (H10N7). While, the internal genes of the isolate were higher identity to H9N2 and the other subtype AIVs, respectively. The sequence alignment revealed that the isolate probably was a natural reassortant from different subtype AIVs. Pathogenic study displayed that the artificially infected mice did not show any clinical symptoms and weight gain loss. However, the virus could be only detected in lungs and turbinates of the infected mice. These data demonstrated that the virus was also low pathogenic to mice.

In this study, we evaluated the pathogenicity of two clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 viruses in pigeons and the potential viral transmissibility to specific-pathogen-free chickens in direct close contact with experimentally infected pigeons. No pigeons from the A/goose/Eastern China/Xin/2015 (GS/Xin) group exhibited clinical signs or mortality, and the virus was only detected in a few organs. However, 3 of 12 pigeons inoculated with the A/goose/Eastern China/0326/2015 (GS/0326) virus died, and 7 of 12 showed neurological symptoms and efficient viral replication in multiple organs. In both groups, viral shedding occurred in only some of the pigeons, the shedding period was relatively short, and the infection was not transmitted to the chickens. We also used chicken, duck, and BALB/c mouse models to evaluate the pathogenicity of the two H5N6 isolates. Both H5N6 isolates showed highly pathogenic to chickens but different degrees of pathogenicity in mice. Interestingly, in ducks, the intravenous pathogenicity index indicated that the GS/Xin isolate was low pathogenic, and the GS/0326 isolate was highly pathogenic, corresponding to the pathogenicity in pigeons. Our results indicated that the pathogenicity of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 virus is diverse in pigeons, and pigeons contribute little to its transmission among poultry. However, pigeons may still be potential healthy reservoirs of the H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.																					WOS:000558156400041	32768222

Antibody-mediated enhancement aggravates chikungunya virus infection and disease severity								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				8						1860	10.1038/s41598-018-20305-4				JAN 30 2018	2018	The arthropod-transmitted chikungunya virus (CHIKV) causes a flu-like disease that is characterized by incapacitating arthralgia. The re-emergence of CHIKV and the continual risk of new epidemics have reignited research in CHIKV pathogenesis. Virus-specific antibodies have been shown to control virus clearance, but antibodies present at sub-neutralizing concentrations can also augment virus infection that exacerbates disease severity. To explore this occurrence, CHIKV infection was investigated in the presence of CHIKV-specific antibodies in both primary human cells and a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. Enhanced attachment of CHIKV to the primary human monocytes and B cells was observed while increased viral replication was detected in RAW264.7 cells. Blocking of specific Fc receptors (Fc gamma Rs) led to the abrogation of these observations. Furthermore, experimental infection in adult mice showed that animals had higher viral RNA loads and endured more severe joint inflammation in the presence of sub-neutralizing concentrations of CHIKV-specific antibodies. In addition, CHIKV infection in 11 days old mice under enhancing condition resulted in higher muscles viral RNA load detected and death. These observations provide the first evidence of antibody-mediated enhancement in CHIKV infection and pathogenesis and could also be relevant for other important arboviruses such as Zika virus.

SBV mainly infects ruminants and closely related viruses such as Sabo virus (SABOV), Simbu virus (SIMBUV) and Sathuperi virus (SATV) have been isolated from their insect-vectors or putative ruminant hosts. However, information about their pathogenesis and in vivo studies with SABOV, SIMBUV, and SATV are scarce. As experimental infections of ruminants are comprehensive and time-consuming, an SBV small animal model was assessed regarding its suitability for studying Simbu viruses. Adult type I interferon deficient mice (IFNAR-/-) were subcutaneously infected with the Simbu serogroup members SABOV, SIMV and SATV, respectively, and compared to SBV-infected mice. All animals were clinically, virologically, serologically, and pathologically examined. The clinical signs were mainly characterised by the loss of body weight and by paralysis. In blood, and samples from the spleen and brain, high loads of viral genome were detected using newly developed real-time PCR assays. The most common histologic lesions included meningo-encephalomyelitis, perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes and macrophages, neuronal degeneration and gliosis. These lesions have also been described in foetuses after transplacental infection with SBV. In-situ hybridisation signals were widely distributed in multiple neurons of the brain and spinal cord in all examined, inoculated mice. In conclusion, IFNAR-/- mice are a suitable animal model for pathogenesis studies of a broad range of Simbu serogroup viruses since all the viruses examined displayed a common pattern of viral organ and tissue distribution in this mouse model.

In this study, we constructed a transgene expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets the noncoding region of the IAV RNA gene encoding nucleoprotein (NP). To investigate the antiviral effects of the shRNA, we generated two transgenic mouse lines with this transgene. Unfortunately, there was no apparent difference in IAV resistance between transgenic and non-transgenic littermates. To further investigate the antiviral effects of the shRNA, we prepared mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from transgenic and non-transgenic mice. In experimental infections using these MEFs, virus production of mouse-adapted IAV strain A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (PR8) in the transgenic MEFs was suppressed by means of the down-regulation of the viral RNA gene transcription in the early stages of infection in comparison with non-transgenic MEFs. These results indicated that expression of the shRNA was able to confer antiviral properties against IAVs to MEFs, although the effects were limited. Our findings suggest that the shRNA targeting the noncoding region of the viral RNA (vRNA) of NP might be a supporting tool in developing influenza-resistant poultry.

The tests included the hemagglutination-inhibition test (HIT), immunoglobulin M (IgM)-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with WNV-infected mouse brain antigen, immunoglobulin G (IgG) indirect ELISA with tickborne encephalitis viral antigen, the microtitre virus neutralization test, the standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), and the microtitre PRNT (micro-PRNT). Thirty adult chickens, intravenously and intramuscularly inoculated with 101 plaque-forming units (PFU) of WNV strain Egypt 101, were bled and given a booster of 10(7) PFU at 7,15, and 21 d postinoculation; the final blood collection was on day 28. Although the micro-PRNT is capable of detecting the highest antibody titres during both early and late infection, because of the technical complexity and time requirements of this test a combination of IgM and IgG ELISAs is recommended for serologic screening. Serum samples that give positive results in the ELISAs can then be tested by the micro-PRNT to determine the specificity of antibodies to WNV.																					WOS:000182666300008	12760478

Because of a lack of appropriate animal models, not much is known about their potential viral etiology. Infection by liver-tropic viruses is one possibility for the breakdown of self-tolerance. Therefore, we infected mice with adenovirus Ad5 expressing human cytochrome P450 2D6 (Ad-2D6). Ad-2D6-infected mice developed persistent autoimmune liver disease, apparent by cellular infiltration, hepatic fibrosis, "fused" liver lobules, and necrosis. Similar to type 2 AIH patients, Ad-2D6 infected mice generated type 1 liver kidney microsomal-like antibodies recognizing the immunodominant epitope WDPAQPPRD of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Interestingly, Ad-2D6-infected wild-type FVB/N mice displayed exacerbated liver damage when compared with transgenic mice expressing the identical human CYP2D6 protein in the liver, indicating the presence of a stronger immunological tolerance in CYP2D6 mice. We demonstrate for the first time that infection with a virus expressing a natural human autoantigen breaks tolerance, resulting in a chronic form of severe, autoimmune liver damage. Our novel model system should be instrumental for studying mechanisms involved in the initiation, propagation, and precipitation of virus-induced autoimmune liver diseases.

The disease is characterized by interactions between B cells and CD4(+) T cells resulting in polyclonal activation of both cell types. It is known that BM5def is expressed at highest levels in B cells and that B cells serve as viral APC. The CD19-CD21 complex and CD22 on the surface of B cells play critical roles as regulators of B cell responses to a variety of stimuli, influencing cell activation, differentiation, and survival. CD19 integrates positive signals induced by B cell receptor ligation by interacting with the protooncogene Vav, which leads to subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of this molecule. In contrast, CD22 negatively regulates Vav phosphorylation. To analyze the role of CD19, CD21, Vav, and CD22 in MAIDS, we infected mice deficient in CD19, CD21 (CR2), Vav-1, or CD22 with LP-BM5 murine leukemia viruses. Infected CR2(-/-) mice developed MAIDS with a time course and severity indistinguishable from that of wildtype mice. In contrast, CD19 as well as Vav-1 deficiency restricted viral replication and suppressed the development of typical signs of MAIDS including splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and hypergammaglobulinemia. Finally, CD22 deficiency was found to accelerate MAIDS development. These results provide novel insights into the B cell signaling pathways required for normal induction and progression of MAIDS.																					WOS:000179170300032	12421939	
J	GOMBOLD, JL; SUTHERLAND, RM; LAVI, E; PATERSON, Y; WEISS, SR								MOUSE HEPATITIS-VIRUS A59-INDUCED DEMYELINATION CAN OCCUR IN THE ABSENCE OF CD8(+) T-CELLS								MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS				18	3			211	221		10.1016/S0882-4010(95)90058-6				MAR 1995	1995	Mouse hepatitis virus causes a chronic demyelinating disease in C57BL/6 mice. While early studies suggested demyelination is due to direct cytolytic effects of virus on oligodendrocytes, there is increasing evidence for the involvement of the immune system in the mechanism of demyelination. In this study we have asked whether demyelination can occur in the absence of functional MHC class I expression and CD8(+) T cells. We infected transgenic mice lacking expression of beta(2) microglobulin (beta(2)M(-/-) mice) with MHV-A59. In beta(2)M(-/-) mice, virus was much more lethal than in either of the parental strains used to produce the mice; furthermore, while clearance from the CNS did occur in beta(2)M(-/-) mice, it was slower than in C57BL/6 mice. This is consistent with the importance of CD8(+) cells in viral clearance. Because of the increased sensitivity of the beta(2)M(-/-) mice to infection, only low levels of virus could be used to evaluate chronic disease. Even at these low levels, demyelination did occur in some animals. To compare infection in beta(2)M(-/-) and C57BL/6 mice we used a higher dose of an attenuated variant of MHV-A59, C12. The attenuated variant induced less demyelination in C57BL/6 mice compared to wild type A59, but the levels observed were not significantly different from those seen in beta(2)M(-/-) mice. Thus, MHV-induced demyelination can occur in some animals in the absence of MHC class I and CD8(+) cells.																					WOS:A1995RE66300006	7565015

Since the first experimental infection of primates with poliovirus (PV), tonsils and the Peyer's patches (PPs) have been believed to be the primary replication sites of EVs. Our aim was to localize different viral markers in the small intestines (SI) of coxsackievirus B (CVB) orally and intraperitoneally (i.p.) infected mice. Methods: Transverse sections of SIs of both infected and control male outbred mice were collected at different intervals post-infection (p.i) and analyzed for presence of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and viral protein VP1 by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization (ISH). Fluorescent marker, eGFP, was identified in cryosections of mice infected with eGFP-CVB3. Results: In the infected SIs, we observed enlarged germinating centers (GCs) in the PPs; IFN-alpha was detected in the PPs and mucosal layer of the SIs. However, VP1, viral RNA and the eGFP were absent in the GCs of PPs at all stages of infection irrespective of the virus strains used. Conclusions: Virus was present in the epithelial cells but not in GCs of the PPs of the murine SIs. Our results do not support the hypothesis of EV replication in the PP especially in the GCs.																					WOS:000735561900001	34946201

Such CPMV-peptide chimeras can be easily and inexpensively produced in large quantities from experimentally infected plants. This study utilized the CPMV chimera platform to create an antiviral against measles virus (NV) by displaying a peptide known to inhibit W infection. This peptide sequence corresponds to a portion of the MV binding site on the human MV receptor CD46. The CPMV-CD46 chimera efficiently inhibited MV infection of HeLa cells in vitro, while wild-type CPMV did not. Furthermore, CPMV-CD46 protected mice from mortality induced by an intracranial challenge with MV. Our results indicate that the inhibitory CD46 peptide expressed on the surface of CPMV retains virus-binding activity and is capable of inhibiting viral entry both in vitro and in vivo. The CD46 peptide presented in the context of CPMV is also up to 100-fold more effective than the soluble CD46 peptide at inhibiting MV infection in vitro. To our knowledge, this study represents the first utilization of a plant virus chimera as an antiviral agent.																					WOS:000174966700029	11932408

Detection of High Levels of European Bat Lyssavirus Type-1 Viral RNA in the Thyroid Gland of Experimentally-Infected Eptesicus fuscus Bats								ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH				56	6-7			270	277		10.1111/j.1863-2378.2008.01203.x				AUG 2009	2009	P>Two common bat lyssavirus species have been identified in many European countries: European bat lyssavirus type-1 and -2 (EBLV-1 and EBLV-2). Only limited knowledge on the susceptibility of the natural EBLV-hosts, insectivorous bats, to lyssavirus infection is available. Our study was undertaken to evaluate the susceptibility and pathology associated with an EBLV-1 infection in Eptesicus fuscus following different routes of virus inoculation including intracranial (n = 6), intramuscular (n = 14), oral (n = 7) and intranasal (n = 7). Blood and saliva samples were collected from all bats on a monthly basis. Four bats inoculated intracranially developed rabies with a mean of 11 days to death, whilst seven bats inoculated intramuscularly developed rabies, with an extended incubation period prior to death. We did not observe any mortality in the oral (p.o.) or intranasal (i.n.) groups and both groups had detectable levels of virus neutralizing antibodies (data not shown). Virus shedding was demonstrated in the saliva by virus isolation and the detection of viral RNA in ill bats, particularly immediately prior to the development of disease. In addition, the presence of virus and viral RNA was detected in the thyroid gland in bats challenged experimentally with EBLV-1, which exceeded that detected in all other extra-neural tissue. The significance of detecting EBLV-1 in the thyroid gland of rabid bats is not well understood. We speculate that the infection of the thyroid gland may cause subacute thyroiditis, a transient form of thyroiditis causing hyperthyroidism, resulting in changes in adrenocortical activity that could lead to hormonal dysfunction, thereby distinguishing the clinical presentation of rabies in the rabid host.

Among various laboratory tests used for this purpose, the study of attenuated strains under conditions of persistent infection in vitro is of particular importance. Experiments were made of a model of a persistent infection caused by attenuated strains of tick-borne encephalitus virus in Syrian hamsters. The strains used were: Elantsev and TP-21, clone 5 of the Langat virus. S. c. administration of these strains to Syrian hamsters led to the development of a persistent infection; virus-specific antigen was detected in the infected animals up to the 94th day by the immunofluorescence method in the absence of any clinical signs of experimental infection. When organ cultures prepared from the brain of a clinically healthy hamster infected with the strain TP-21, clone 5 of the Langat virus were used, a virus designated A-206 was isolated on the 65th day. Some of its characteristics (pathogeneity for mice, cytodestruction in chick embryo cells) distinguished this strain from the clone 5 of TP-21 strain of Langat virus which was administered to Syrian hamsters.

Viral-induced CD28 loss evokes costimulation independent alloimmunity								JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH				196	2			241	246		10.1016/j.jss.2015.02.033				JUN 15 2015	2015	Background: Belatacept, a B7-specific fusion protein, blocks CD28-B7 costimulation and prevents kidney allograft rejection. However, it is ineffective in a sizable minority of patients. Although T-cell receptor and CD28 engagement are known to initiate T-cell activation, many human antigen-experienced T-cells lose CD28, and can be activated independent of CD28 signals. We posit that these cells are central drivers of costimulation blockade resistant rejection (CoBRR) and propose that CoBRR might relate to an accumulation of CD28(-) T-cells resulting from viral antigen exposure.Materials and methods: We infected C57BL/6 mice with polyomavirus (a BK virus analog), murine cytomegalovirus (a human cytomegalovirus analog), and gammaherpesvirus (HV68; an Epsteine-Barr virus analog) and assessed for CD28 expression relative to mock infection controls. We then used mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays to assess the alloreactive response of these mice against major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells.Results: We demonstrated that infection with polyomavirus, murine CMV, and HV68 can induce CD28 downregulation in mice. We showed that these analogs of clinically relevant human viruses enable lymphocytes from infected mice to launch an anamnestic, costimulation blockade resistant, alloreactive response against major histocompatibility complex-mismatched cells without prior alloantigen exposure. Further analysis revealed that gammherpesvirus-induced oligoclonal T-cell expansion is required for the increased alloreactivity.Conclusions: Virus exposure results in reduced T-cell expression of CD28, the target of costimulation blockade therapy. These viruses also contribute to increased alloreactivity. Thus, CD28 downregulation after viral infection may play a seminal role in driving CoBRR. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Susceptibility to acetaminophen (APAP) toxicity unexpectedly is decreased during acute viral hepatitis in mice								BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY				79	9			1363	1371		10.1016/j.bcp.2009.12.019				MAY 1 2010	2010	Acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity results from cytochrome P450 metabolism of APAP to the toxic metabolite, n-acety 1-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI), which reacts with cysteinyl residues to form APAP adducts and initiates cell injury. As APAP is commonly used during viral illnesses there has been concern that APAP injury may be additive to that of viral hepatitis, leading physicians to advise against its use in such patients; this has not been investigated experimentally. We infected C57BL/6 male mice with replication-deficient adenovirus to produce moderately severe acute viral hepatitis and observed that APAP doses that were hepatotoxic or lethal in control mice produced neither death nor additional increase in serum ALT when administered to infected mice at the peak of virus-induced liver injury. Moreover, the concentration of hepatic APAP-protein adducts formed in these mice was only 10% that in control mice. Protection from APAP hepatotoxicity also was observed earlier in the course of infection, prior to the peak virus-induced ALT rise. Hepatic glutathione limits APAP-protein adduct formation but glutathione levels were similar in control and infected mice. Cyp1a2 (E.C. 1.14.14.1) and Cyp2el (E.C. 1.14.13.0) m RNA expression decreased by 3 days post-infection and hepatic Cyp2e1 protein levels were reduced almost 90% at 7 days, when adduct formation was maximally inhibited. In vitro, hepatocytes from vitally infected mice also were resistant to APAP-induced injury but sensitive to NAPQI. Rather than potentiating APAP-induced liver injury, acute viral hepatitis in this model resulted in selective downregulation of APAP metabolizing P450s in liver and decreased the risk of APAP hepatotoxicity.

J	Major, AS; Cuff, CF								Effects of the route of infection on immunoglobulin G subclasses and specificity of the reovirus-specific humoral immune response								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				70	9			5968	5974		10.1128/JVI.70.9.5968-5974.1996				SEP 1996	1996	Reovirus serotype 1, strain Lang (T1/L), a well characterized enteric virus, elicits humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, Although orally and intradermally induced infections generate comparable reovirus-specific serum antibody titers, little is known about the effects of the route of infection on the systemic immunoglobulin G (IgG) response, To assess whether the route of exposure affects virus-specific humoral immunity, we infected various strains of mice with reovirus T1/L by the oral or intradermal routes, At day 10 following infection, virus-specific serum antibody titers and Ige subclasses were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Serum IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies were detected in all mouse strains independent of the route of infection, Mice of the H-2(d) haplotype that received an intradermal infection also had high levels of reovirus-specific serum IgG1. This dichotomy of responses was not associated with differences in the types of cytokine produced by draining peripheral lymph nodes, However, peripheral lymph node lymphocytes from C3H mice produced significantly higher levels of gamma interferon than did BALB/c, C57BL/6, and B10.D2 mice, Additionally, peripheral lymph node lymphocytes from all strains of mice produced only low levels of interleukin-5, with no detectable level of interleukin-4 or interleukin-6. Analysis of specific antibody at inductive sites of the immune response showed that orally infected Peyer's patches produced predominately IgA and intradermally infected peripheral lymph nodes produced predominately IgG2a. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis showed that virus-specific IgA, IgG1, and IgG2a reacted with reovirus structural proteins, These data suggest that the route of infection affects the isotype and IgG subclasses, but not the antigen specificity, of the local antibody response, In addition, virus-specific IgG1 generated following an intradermally induced infection is linked to the H-2(d) major histocompatibility complex haplotype.

We previously showed that mice could be infected by BVDV. In the present study, we infected mice intraperitoneally with non-cytopathic (ncp) BVDV1 or ncp BVDV2, harvested the blood and organs of the infected mice at days 4, 7, 10 and 14 postinfection (pi), and performed immunohistochemical analyses to confirm BVDV infection. Viral antigens were detected in the spleens of all infected mice from days 4 through 14 and were also found in the mesenteric lymph nodes, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), heart, kidney, intestine, and bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) of some infected mice. In ncp BVDV2-infected mice, flow cytometric analysis revealed markedly fewer CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and lower expression of costimulatory molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (I-A/I-E) than those in ncp BVDV1-infected mice. Production of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-6 and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 was higher in the plasma of ncp BVDV2-infected mice than that in that of ncp BVDV1-infected mice. Our results demonstrate that ncp BVDV1 and ncp BVDV2 interact differently with the host innate immune response in vivo. These findings highlight an important distinction between ncp BVDV1 and ncp BVDV2 and suggest that ncp BVDV2 impairs the host's ability to control the infection and enhances virus dissemination.

J	Hati, R.; Sarkar, P.								Dissemination of rabies street virus in experimentally infected mice.								Indian Journal of Virology				3	1-2			18	25						1987, publ. 1988	1987	Following inoculation of 30 mice with rabies street virus by intracerebaral (IC) route examination of brain, facial skin and cornea showed that only the brain tissues of 12.5% of the mice were rabies positive in the preclinical stage. In the post-clinical stage, however, all these tissues were positive for rabies virus. While the brain and spinal cord of all these infected mice were involved, the salivary gland, facial skin and cornea of 66.3, 72.2 and 33.3%, respectively, of these mice were rabies positive. Combined test of facial skin and cornea exhibited 83.3% positivity. The first appearance of the virus in the brain was observed on the 3rd day after inoculation (PI) compared with 4 days in the spinal cord and salivary gland. With the advancement of the disease, there was enhancement of the intensity of fluorescence as well as the virus titre in these tissues, highest infectivity titre being 105.8 MLD50 in both brain and spinal cord and 104.8 MLD50 in the salivary gland. The intraplantar route of virus inoculation revealed the first appearance of the virus in both brain and cervical cord after 5 days and in the lumbar cord after 4 days. By this route of inoculation the salivary gland and the cornea, however, exhibited the first appearance of the virus on the 5th and 6th day, repectively, thus showing that the intraplantar route of inoculation takes longer for the spread of the infection in the central nervous system.

BPP-III had no effect on antibody production, but increased populations of CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cells, CTL levels and proliferation activities of splenic T-lymphocytes. BPP-V increased the level of antibodies (HI, IgG and its subtype IgG1) and the cytokine IL-4, as well as the ratio of CD3(+) T cells and its subsets CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, BPP-V also increased CTL level and promoted the proliferation activity of T- and B-lymphocyte. Furthermore, in animal challenge experiment, BPP-III and BPP-V reduced viral RNA copies and viral titers, and reduced inflammatory cell infiltration.Conclusion: In summary, BPP-IV did not have an effect on specific immune responses, therefore it could not reduce pathological damage in mice lungs; BPP-III provided resistance to the antigen through the cell-mediated immune response; BPP-V enhanced both humoral and cellular immune responses, therefore provided protections against the H9N2 Avian Influenza Virus (AIV). Altogether, BPP-III and BPP-V could be adjuvant candidates for the H9N2 avian influenza vaccine.																					WOS:000446672500007	30081784

Serologlc evidence of California encephalitis virus and western equine encephalitis virus in snowshoe hares								ZOONOSES RES				3	(3)			153	164						1964	1964	Attempts to isolate viruses from, and neutralization tests on, serum samples from Alberta snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were carried out in 1961 through 1963. Attempted isolations were unsuccessful, but neutralizing antibodies to Western equine encephalitis (WEEV) and California encephalitis virus (CEV) were found, The incidence of CEV neutralizing antibodies in adult hares ranged from 63% to 97%. There appeared to be a period of virus activity in May and early June 1962. Complement fixation tests with serum from the field found CEV positive by the neutralization test indicated that the virus present in the study area was more closely related to the Montana snowehoe hare CEV strain than to the California BFS 283 strain or the North Dakota Trivitattus virus. Up to 104-0 suckling mouse LD50 of virus (per ml whole blood) was detected in hares experimentally infected with CEV (Montana), Virus was recovered up to three successive days following exposure. WEEV antibodies were found in 0% to 18% of the adult hare population from June 1961 through April 1963. By June 1963 the incidence had abruptly risen to 95%. The incidence of WEEV neutralizing antibodies in juvenile hares also pointed to May as the time of WEEV activity. Serum from 12 of 18 Franklin's ground squirrels (Citellus franklin) was also found to contain WEEV antibodies. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Author																					BCI:BCI19674800030204	5895901

The ferret will develop febrile illness when infected with influenza A viruses and has successfully been used for study of influenza virus inhibitors. Evaluation parameters commonly include temperature elevation, virus recovery from respiratory tissues and nasal washes and pneumonia-associated mortality. The mouse is often chosen because of its lower cost, ready availability, and ease of handling. Disease parameters using this model include pneumonia-associated mortality, decline in arterial oxygen saturation, lung consolidation, lung virus titers, host weight loss, and increase in serum alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein. Antiviral data using both animal models are usually comparable; based on studies with amantadine, rimantadine, zanamivir, and oseltamivir, they are predictive for efficacy in the clinic. Rapid development of viral resistance to amantadine and rimantadine and a failure to observe resistance development to the influenza neuraminidase inhibitors has been demonstrated in the murine model. Immunocompromised mice have been used in studies with the latter compounds to demonstrate that their disease-inhibitory effect is not dependent upon the host's immune system. The concepts in the utilization of animal models for study of antiviral drugs will be reviewed.

J	Verhoeven, David; Perry, Sheldon; Pryharski, Karin								Control of influenza infection is impaired by diminished interferon-gamma secretion by CD4 T cells in the lungs of toddler mice								JOURNAL OF LEUKOCYTE BIOLOGY				100	1			203	212		10.1189/jlb.4A1014-497RR				JUL 2016	2016	Respiratory viral infections, such as influenza, can lead to delayed viral clearance in toddlers, possibly exacerbating disease morbidity. We hypothesized that defective CD4 T cells in toddlers may contribute to a failure to clear virus at a similar rate to adults. Thus, we developed a young mouse model to examine potential divergent responses between toddlers and adults. We determined that young mice (toddler mice, 21 d old) were actively generating and recruiting effector/memory T cells, whereas memory populations were firmly established in older, adult mice (8-10 wk old). We infected toddler and adult mice with influenza A/PR8/34 (H1N1) and found young mice had elevated morbidity, asmeasured by enhancedweight loss and lower partial pressure of oxygen levels, throughout the infection, thus, modeling the higher morbidity observed in children (<2 y old) during infection. Early viral loads were comparable to adult mice, but toddler mice failed to clear virus by 10 d postinfection. This delayed clearance corresponded to poor lung recruitment of CD4 T cells, lower antiviral T cell responses, and lower B cell/antibodies in the lungs. Mechanistically, diminished interferon-gamma was detected in the lungs of toddler mice throughout the infection and corresponded to intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, CD4 T cell limitations in interferon-gamma transcription. Moreover, defects in interferon-gamma production appeared downstream from signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 in the interleukin-12 signaling pathway, suggesting maturational delays different from neonates. Importantly, recombinant interferon-gamma supplementation rescued CD4 T cell numbers in the lungs and influenza-specific antibody formation. This study highlights the intrinsic limitations in CD4 T cell effector functions that may arise in toddlers and contribute to disease pathology.																					WOS:000379738200021	26823488

Soiled-bedding sentinel detection of murine norovirus 4								JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE				47	3			31	36						MAY 2008	2008	According to serologic surveys, murine norovirus (MNV) is the most prevalent viral pathogen infecting mice used in biomedical research. However, the use of sentinel mice to detect MNV infected mouse populations has not been evaluated thoroughly. To this end, an experimental method of soiled bedding transfer was created to mimic a quarterly sentinel monitoring program. Soiled bedding (15 or 30 cm(3)) from ICR mice experimentally infected with MNV4 was transferred weekly to cages of pair-housed 4-wk-old ICR mice. After 12 wk, both mice in 80% (4 of 5) of cages receiving either 15 or 30 cm3 of soiled bedding were seropositive for MNV and were shedding virus in feces. To evaluate the stability of MNV RNA in mouse feces, fecal pellets from MNV infected sentinel mice were stored at room temperature for as long as 14 d. After storage, all fecal samples tested positive for MNV by RT-PCR. To determine whether fecal samples could be pooled for MNV detection, 1 MNV positive fecal pellet was combined with either 9 or 19 MNV negative fecal pellets. All pooled fecal samples were positive for MNV by RT-PCR at both dilutions. These data indicate that although MNV infected mouse populations can be detected by exposing sentinel mice to MNV contaminated bedding, detection failures can occur. In addition, there was high agreement in the MNV infection status of cohoused sentinel mice. These data also demonstrate that MNV is readily detectable in pooled fecal samples and in mouse feces stored at room temperature for 2 wk.																					WOS:000255968800005	18459710

Tick-Borne Transmission of Murine Gammaherpesvirus 68								FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY				7						458	10.3389/fcimb.2017.00458				OCT 31 2017	2017	Herpesviruses are a large group of DNA viruses infecting mainly vertebrates. Murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) is often used as a model in studies of the pathogenesis of clinically important human gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus. This rodent virus appears to be geographically widespread; however, its natural transmission cycle is unknown. Following detection of MHV68 in field-collected ticks, including isolation of the virus from tick salivary glands and ovaries, we investigated whether MHV68 is a tick-borne virus. Uninfected Ixodes ricinus ticks were shown to acquire the virus by feeding on experimentally infected laboratory mice. The virus survived tick molting, and the molted ticks transmitted the virus to uninfected laboratory mice on which they subsequently fed. MHV68 was isolated from the tick salivary glands, consistent with transmission via tick saliva. The virus survived in ticks without loss of infectivity for at least 120 days, and subsequently was transmitted vertically from one tick generation to the next, surviving more than 500 days. Furthermore, the F1 generation (derived from F0 infected females) transmitted MHV68 to uninfected mice on which they fed, with MHV68 M3 gene transcripts detected in blood, lung, and spleen tissue of mice on which F1 nymphs and F1 adults engorged. These experimental data fulfill the transmission criteria that define an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus), the largest biological group of viruses. Currently, African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the only DNA virus recognized as an arbovirus. Like ASFV, MHV68 showed evidence of pathogenesis in ticks. Previous studies have reported MHV68 in free-living ticks and in mammals commonly infested with I. ricinus, and neutralizing antibodies to MHV68 have been detected in large mammals (e.g., deer) including humans. Further studies are needed to determine if these reports are the result of tick-borne transmission of MHV68 in nature, and whether humans are at risk of infection.

J	Van Reeth, K								Cytokines in the pathogenesis of influenza								VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY				74	1-2			109	116		10.1016/S0378-1135(00)00171-1				MAY 22 2000	2000	Uncomplicated influenza in humans, horses or swine is characterized by massive virus replication in respiratory epithelial cells, inflammation and an abrupt onset of general and respiratory disease. There is now growing evidence that the so-called early cytokines produced at the site of infection mediate many of the clinical and pathological manifestations. Among these cytokines are interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta, interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte-attracting chemokines. This paper reviews: (1) in vivo examinations of the cytokine profiles during influenza in mice, humans or swine; (2) in vivo data on the probable role of these cytokines; and (3) selected in vitro data on cytokine induction by the influenza virus. Examination of respiratory secretions of experimentally infected humans or animals revealed a brisk and concurrent rise in several of the cytokines mentioned. Moreover, peak cytokine levels directly correlated with virus replication and disease. In the mouse model, specific anticytokine strategies have further confirmed the role of cytokines in body temperature changes, anorexia and lung inflammation. However, cytokines were clearly not the only factor contributing to disease, and they seemed to be essential for resolution of the infection. Though influenza virus was shown to induce cytokines in cell culture, in vitro experiments have also revealed conflicting data. Furthermore, the viral genes or products that are responsible for cytokine induction are unknown. Exactly this information would make important contributions to our understanding of the genetic basis of viral virulence. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In a previous study, we found that a strain of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) serially passaged in tissue culture (termed SBVp32) unexpectedly displayed increased pathogenicity in suckling mice compared to wild-type SBV. In this study, we mapped the determinants of SBVp32 virulence to the viral genome M segment. SBVp32 virulence is associated with the capacity of this virus to reach high titers in the brains of experimentally infected suckling mice. We also found that the Gc glycoprotein, encoded by the M segment of SBVp32, facilitates host cell protein shutoff in vitro. Interestingly, while the M segment of SBVp32 is a virulence factor, we found that the S segment of the same virus confers by itself an attenuated phenotype to wild-type SBV, as it has lost the ability to block the innate immune system of the host. Single mutations present in the Gc glycoprotein of SBVp32 are sufficient to compensate for both the attenuated phenotype of the SBVp32 S segment and the attenuated phenotype of NSs deletion mutants. Our data also indicate that the SBV p32 M segment does not act as an interferon (IFN) antagonist. Therefore, SBV mutants can retain pathogenicity even when they are unable to fully control the production of IFN by infected cells. Overall, this study suggests that the viral glycoprotein of orthobunyaviruses can compensate, at least in part, for the function of NSs. In addition, we also provide evidence that the induction of total cellular protein shutoff by SBV is determined by multiple viral proteins, while the ability to control the production of IFN maps to the NSs protein.IMPORTANCEThe identification of viral determinants of pathogenesis is key to the development of prophylactic and intervention measures. In this study, we found that the bunyavirus Gc glycoprotein is a virulence factor. Importantly, we show that mutations in the Gc glycoprotein can restore the pathogenicity of attenuated mutants resulting from deletions or mutations in the nonstructural protein NSs. Our findings highlight the fact that careful consideration should be taken when designing live attenuated vaccines based on deletions of nonstructural proteins since single mutations in the viral glycoproteins appear to revert attenuated mutants to virulent phenotypes.

J	Kaleta, EF								Foot-and-mouth disease: susceptibility of domestic poultry and free-living birds to infection and to disease - a review of the historical and current literature concerning the role of birds in spread of foot-and-mouth disease viruses								DEUTSCHE TIERARZTLICHE WOCHENSCHRIFT				109	9			391	399						SEP 2002	2002	Ruminants and pigs are the dominant natural hosts of food-and-mouth disease (FMD) viruses. Approximately 70 additional mammalian species are found to be susceptible under natural or experimental conditions. Reptilia, amphibia, and fish are probably naturally resistant to infection. According to the reviewed literature, domestic birds (chickens, turkeys, guinea fowl, ducks and geese) have been experimentally infected with some strains of FMD viruses and may develop lesions suggestive of FMD such as vesicular lesions on the comb, wattles, eye lids, and feet. Since chickens are to some extent coprophagous, chickens get infected by ingestion of virus under conditions of natural exposure or their plumage gets contaminated in an infectious environment. Thus, domestic birds kept in free-run systems may serve as virus vectors for short distances. Free-living birds, especially starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), sea gulls (Larus canus), house-sparrows (Passer domesticus) have been successfully experimentally infected and developed vesicular lesions on the skin and mucosal membrans of the mouth. During epizootics of FMD the plumage of these free-living birds can be contaminated with FMD viruses and the virus is spread over long distances during migration periods in spring and autumn. Thus migrating birds may assume an active role in long distance dissemination of FMD viruses.																					WOS:000178358200003	12395578

The expression of hBD-2 increases upon stimulation of numerous cell types with LPS and proinflammatory cytokines. In contrast, hBD-1 remains constitutively expressed in most cells in spite of cytokine or LPS stimulation; however, its presence in human PDC suggests it plays a role in viral host defense. To examine this, we characterized the expression of hBD-1 in innate immune cells in response to viral challenge. PDC and monocytes increased production of hBD-1 peptide and mRNA as early as 2 h following infection of purified cells and PBMCs with PR8, HSV-1, and Sendai virus. However, treatment of primary NHBE cells with influenza resulted in a 50% decrease in hBD-1 mRNA levels, as measured by qRT-PCR at 3 h following infection. A similar inhibition occurred with HSV-1 challenge of human gingival epithelial cells. Studies with HSV-1 showed that replication occurred in epithelial cells but not in PDC. Together, these results suggest that hBD-1 may play a role in preventing viral replication in immune cells. To test this, we infected C57BL/6 WT mice and mBD-1((-/-)) mice with mouse-adapted HK18 (300 PFU/mouse). mBD-1((-/-)) mice lost weight earlier and died sooner than WT mice (P=0.0276), suggesting that BD-1 plays a role in early innate immune responses against influenza in vivo. However, lung virus titers were equal between the two mouse strains. Histopathology showed a greater inflammatory influx in the lungs of mBD-1((-/-)) mice at Day 3 postinfection compared with WT C57BL/6 mice. The results suggest that BD-1 protects mice from influenza pathogenesis with a mechanism other than inhibition of viral replication. J. Leukoc. Biol. 90: 343-356; 2011.

Experimental Zika virus infection in Aedes aegypti: Susceptibility, transmission & co-infection with dengue & chikungunya viruses								INDIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH				147				88	96		10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1142_17				JAN 2018	2018	Background & objectives: There are reports about the susceptibility of Aedes mosquitoes to ZIKV from various countries, however, no such information is available from Indian sub-continent, although, high level of group cross-reactivity of ZIKV with other flaviviruses has been reported. During outbreak situations, many cases of Dengue (DEN) and Chikungunya (CHIK) are reported. In such scenario, vector mosquitoes are likely to get co-infection/secondary-infection with one or other virus. The present study was carried out to determine the susceptibility of Indian strain of Aedes aegypti to Zika virus (ZIKV) strain (MR-766) and the effect of co-infection/super-infection with either dengue virus (serotype-2) (DENV) or chikungunya virus (CHIKV) on ZIKV replication.Methods: Ae. aegypti mosquitoes used in this study were reared for many generations since 1980 at laboratory colony maintained at the ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune, India. Transmissibility of ZIKV from infected mosquitoes to suckling mice was also studied. Mosquitoes were experimentally infected with ZIKV and super-infected with either DENV or CHIKV via membrane-feeding route and incubated for 14 days at 28 +/- 2 degrees C and humidity of 85 +/- 5 per cent. Replication of these viruses in mosquitoes was confirmed using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence assay. Twenty infected mosquitoes were allowed to feed upon four suckling CD1 mice for about 30 min. Transmission of the ZIKV by infected mosquitoes to suckling mice was confirmed by the appearance of clinical signs and the presence of viral RNA in different organs.Results: Concomitant infection of mosquitoes with all the three viruses showed simultaneous propagation of all three viruses, confirmed by real time RT-PCR and IFA. Infection of mosquitoes with CHIKV followed by ZIKV showed positivity in individual head squashes (7%) for both viruses using IFA; only 8.3 per cent showed dual positivity with primary infection of ZIKV followed by DENV; 8.3 per cent dual infection positivity was observed when infected with DENV followed by ZIKV; 5 per cent showed dual infection was observed when infected with ZIKV followed by CHIKV. Ae. aegypti was found to be susceptible to ZIKV strain as ZIKV could be detected from the second post-infection day (PID) in infected mosquitoes. Transmission of ZIKV to mice by the bite of infected Ae. aegypti establishes this species as a potential vector.Interpretation & conclusions: From super-infection experiments, it was concluded that ZIKV might have a relative advantage in replication dynamics over DENV. Vertical transmission was not observed for ZIKV in experimentally infected mosquitoes (n= 920 larvae). Further studies are required to understand the possibility of silently circulating ZIKV in India, which remain non-detected because of lack of surveillance.

Lack of correlation between rabies virus replication in the brain and antibody isotype profile in genetically modified mice								JOURNAL OF VENOMOUS ANIMALS AND TOXINS INCLUDING TROPICAL DISEASES				12	3			423	434						2006	2006	The relationship among the phenotypes resistance to infection, virus replication in the brain and isotype production was investigated in genetically modified High (H) or Low (L) antibody responder mouse lines. Although they express the same innate susceptibility to rabies infection, these lines differ as to different viral replication rates in the central nervous system and L mice showed a higher permissible state. After intramuscular infection with the Pasteur rabies strain (PV), the H-L interline differences on the earlier stage of virus replication were 1000 and 80 folds on days 5 and 6, respectively. The isotype profile in sera of the experimentally infected mice reflected an interline difference of 25 folds for IgG2a throughout the infection period, and for the IgE production the H-L difference was highly significant only at the beginning of the process. These results confirm the multi-specific effect of antibody immune responsiveness and the general isotype distribution of antibodies in these genetically selected mice. Contrary to the clear correlation between antibody responsiveness and the acquired resistance to rabies infection, the present study demonstrates that the constitutive genetic character of High and Low responder individuals does not intervene in the degree of resistance following infection. Altogether, this study contributes to the knowledge of the protective role of the general innate responsiveness on the pathological pattern to rabies virus infection.

Viral RNA was extracted from tissue samples and amplified by reverse transcriptase PCR in the presence of an internal standard RNA. The ratio of PCR product derived from viral RNA and internal;standard RNA was then determined using specific probes in a post-PCR electrochemiluminescent hybridization assay. This provided an estimate of the viral RNA copy number in the original sample, and detection of PCR product derived from internal standard RNA validated sample processing and amplification procedures. RNA copy number correlated with viral infectivity of cell culture-derived virus, and one tissue culture infective dose was found to contain approximately 10(3) genome equivalents. The ratio of RNA copy number to infectivity in myocardial tissue taken from mice during the acute phase of coxsackievirus B3 myocarditis was more variable ranging from 10(4)-10(7), and was dependent on the stage of infection, reflecting differential rates of clearance for viral RNA and viral infectivity. The assay is rapid, and could facilitate investigations which currently rely upon enterovirus quantitation by titration in cell culture. This would be useful for experimental studies of viral pathogenesis, prophylaxis and antiviral therapy. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

After intracerebral challenge of newborn Balb/c mice with 10-3.5 TCID-50, no signs of neurological disease appeared in the animals, but large amounts of antigen were detected in situ in several tissues and organs by immunohistochemical staining. Reference Coxsackie A9 virus (Griggs strain, from ATCC) inoculated in mice showed a typical picture of paralysis. Rabbit antisera developed against C-47 or A9 cross-detected viral antigens in situ. In a second set of experiments, rabbits were infected with the C-47 isolate by injection of the virus in the vitreous humor or in the retrobulbar cavity of the eye. Viremia was detected in the infected animals; antigen in tissue sections was revealed by immunohistochemical staining using human immune serum. The virus was detected in the cerebra spinal fluid of rabbits inoculated in the vitreous humor, but not when inoculated in the retrobulbar cavity. Two isolates and a reference A9 Griggs strain were intrathecally inoculated in the monkeys and none developed either meningitis, or illness. It was concluded that the C-47 isolate caused subclinical infection in mice and rabbits experimentally infected, but did not cause encephalitis like the reference Cox A9 virus.

Predicting the Outcome of Infectious Diseases: Variability among Inbred Mice as a New and Powerful Tool for Biomarker Discovery								MBIO				3	5					e00199-12	10.1128/mBio.00199-12				SEP-OCT 2012	2012	Individuals respond differently to infectious diseases. Even among inbred mice that are presumed to be genetically identical, the response to a microbial pathogen is variable, which is generally thought to reflect experimental inconsistencies, technical errors, and stochastic processes. Here we describe the remarkable observation that the variability of Helicobacter pylori colonization density in the stomachs of experimentally infected C57BL/6J mice is tightly correlated with weight loss and viral load after a challenge with influenza virus, though H. pylori infection per se does not affect influenza and vice versa. Since these two infectious agents are found in different tissue compartments and are detected using unrelated methods, the correlation in microbial burden must represent a biological measure of disease susceptibility among genetically nearly identical individuals and not technical or stochastic factors. We hypothesize that inbred mice represent a powerful new tool for the identification of biomarkers to predict the outcome of infectious diseases.																					WOS:000310585000004	23073762

Respiratory and neurological disease in rabbits experimentally infected with equid herpesvirus 1								MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS				87				45	50		10.1016/j.micpath.2015.07.007				OCT 2015	2015	Equid herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) is an important pathogen of horses worldwide, associated with respiratory, reproductive and/or neurological disease. A mouse model for EHV-1 infection has been established but fails to reproduce some important aspects of the viral pathogenesis. Then, we investigated the susceptibility of rabbits to EHV-1 aiming at proposing this species as an alternative model for EHV-1 infection. Weanling rabbits inoculated intranasal with EHV-1 Kentucky D (10(7) TCID50/animal) shed virus in nasal secretions up to day 8-10 post-inoculation (pi), presented viremia up to day 14 pi and seroconverted to EHV-1 (virus neutralizing titers 4 to 64). Most rabbits (75%) developed respiratory disease, characterized by serous to hemorrhagic nasal discharge and mild to severe dyspnea. Some animals (20%) presented neurological signs as circling, bruxism and opisthotonus. Six animals died during acute disease (days 3-6); infectious virus and/or viral DNA were detected in the lungs, trigeminal ganglia (TG), olfactory bulbs (OBs) and cerebral cortex/brain (CC). Histological examination showed necrohemorrhagic, multifocal to coalescent bronchointerstitial pneumonia and diffuse alveolar edema. In two rabbits euthanized at day 50 pi, latent EHV-1 DNA was detected in the OBs. Dexamethasone administration at day 50 pi resulted in virus reactivation, demonstrated by virus shedding, viremia, clinical signs, and increase in VN titers and/or by detection of virus DNA in lungs, OBs, TGs and/or CC. These results demonstrate that rabbits are susceptible to EHV-1 infection and develop respiratory and neurological signs upon experimental inoculation. Thus, rabbits may be used to study selected aspects of EHV-1 biology and pathogenesis, extending and complementing the mouse model. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

HCV particles in the blood of infected patients are characterized by heterogeneous buoyant densities, likely owing to HCV association with lipoproteins. However, clinical isolates are not infectious in vitro and the relative infectivity of the particles with respect to their buoyant density therefore cannot be determined, pointing to the need for better in vivo model systems.METHODS: To analyze the evolution of the buoyant density of in vivo-derived infectious HCV particles over time, we infected immunodeficient human liver chimeric fumaryl acetoacetate hydrolase-/- mice with J6/JFH1 and performed ultracentrifugation of infectious mouse sera on isopicnic iodixanol gradients. We also evaluated the impact of a high sucrose diet, which has been shown to increase very-low-density lipoprotein secretion by the liver in rodents, on lipoprotein and HCV particle characteristics.RESULTS: Similar to the severe combined immunodeficiency disease/Albumin-urokinase plasminogen activator human liver chimeric mouse model, density fractionation of infectious mouse serum showed higher infectivity in the low-density fractions early after infection. However, over the course of the infection, viral particle heterogeneity increased and the overall in vitro infectivity diminished without loss of the human liver graft over time. In mice provided with a sucrose-rich diet we observed a minor shift in HCV infectivity toward lower density that correlated with a redistribution of triglycerides and cholesterol among lipoproteins.CONCLUSIONS: Our work indicates that the heterogeneity in buoyant density of infectious HCV particles evolves over the course of infection and can be influenced by diet.

The aim of the present study was to identify topographical differences of TMEV spread and demyelination in the brain of experimentally infected susceptible SJL/J mice and resistant C57BL/6 mice. Methods: Demyelination was confirmed by Luxol fast blue and cresyl violet staining and axonal damage by neurofilament-specific and beta-amyloid precursor protein-specific immunohistochemistry. Viral dissemination within the central nervous system (CNS) was quantified by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Further, the phenotype of infected cells was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Results: An early transient infection of periventricular cells followed by demyelination and axonopathies around the fourth ventricle in SJL/J mice was noticed. Periventricular and brain stem demyelination was associated with a predominant infection of microglia/macrophages and oligodendrocytes. Conclusions: Summarized, the demonstration of ependymal infection and subjacent spread into the brain parenchyma as well as regional virus clearance despite ongoing demyelination and axonal damage in other CNS compartments allows new insights into TME pathogenesis. This novel aspect of TMEV CNS interaction will enhance the understanding of region-specific susceptibilities to injury and regenerative capacities of the brain in this MS model.

J	LeBon, A; Desaymard, C; Papiernik, M								Neonatal impaired response to viral superantigen encoded by MMTV(SW) and mtv-7								INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOLOGY				7	12			1897	1903						DEC 1995	1995	MMTV(SW) is an exogenous mouse mammary tumor virus that codes for a superantigen sharing the same V-beta specificity as Mtv-7 (Mls-1(a)). Neonatal mice infected by suckling-infected milk show a deletion of the CD4(+) V(beta)6(+) T cell subset within 8 weeks. In contrast, adult mice infected by injection of the virus in the footpad have a much faster deletion, which occurs within 2 weeks. In the present work, we investigated possible mechanisms for the different kinetics of deletion in the adult and newborn mice. To find out if the route of infection could be responsible for this discrepancy, we infected 5-day-old and adult mice by injection in the footpad. Our results demonstrate that the route of infection is not responsible for the delayed kinetics of reactive T cell deletion since newborn mice injected with the virus show similar kinetics to neonates infected by maternal milk. To exclude differences in viral spreading between the two models, we used a PCR assay to detect proviral DNA. Spreading of the virus was shown to occur at a similar rate or even more rapidly in neonates than in adults. We also compared the activation induced by MMTV(SW) or Mls-1(a) spleen cells in the draining lymph node in neonatal and adult mice and showed that a poor local activation is induced in neonates compared with adults. In vitro, neonatal T cell reactivity to anti-V(beta)6 antibody was also impaired. Thus, the delay in clonal deletion could be linked to impaired expression, presentation and/or response to the viral superantigen. Our results suggest that the initial response to MMTV(SW) could be of importance for the kinetics of reactive T cell deletion.																					WOS:A1995TL63300002	8746559

Bioluminescent Imaging Reveals Divergent Viral Pathogenesis in Two Strains of Stat1-Deficient Mice, and in alpha beta gamma Interferon Receptor-Deficient Mice								PLOS ONE				6	9					e24018	10.1371/journal.pone.0024018				SEP 7 2011	2011	Pivotal components of the IFN response to virus infection include the IFN receptors (IFNR), and the downstream factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1). Mice deficient for Stat1 and IFNR (Stat1(-/-) and IFN alpha beta gamma R-/- mice) lack responsiveness to IFN and exhibit high sensitivity to various pathogens. Here we examined herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) pathogenesis in Stat1(-/-) mice and in IFN alpha beta gamma R-/- mice following corneal infection and bioluminescent imaging. Two divergent and paradoxical patterns of infection were observed. Mice with an N-terminal deletion in Stat1 (129Stat1(-/-) (N-term)) had transient infection of the liver and spleen, but succumbed to encephalitis by day 10 post-infection. In stark contrast, infection of IFN alpha beta gamma R-/- mice was rapidly fatal, with associated viremia and fulminant infection of the liver and spleen, with infected infiltrating cells being primarily of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. To resolve the surprising difference between Stat1(-/-) and IFN alpha beta gamma R-/- mice, we infected an additional Stat1(-/-) strain deleted in the DNA-binding domain (129Stat1(-/-) (DBD)). These 129Stat1(-/-) (DBD) mice recapitulated the lethal pattern of liver and spleen infection seen following infection of IFN alpha beta gamma R-/- mice. This lethal pattern was also observed when 129Stat1(-/-) (N-term) mice were infected and treated with a Type I IFN-blocking antibody, and immune cells derived from 129Stat1(-/-) (N-term) mice were shown to be responsive to Type I IFN. These data therefore show significant differences in viral pathogenesis between two commonly-used Stat1(-/-) mouse strains. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that Stat1 2/2 (N-term) mice have residual Type I IFN receptor-dependent IFN responses. Complete loss of IFN signaling pathways allows viremia and rapid viral spread with a fatal infection of the liver. This study underscores the importance of careful comparisons between knockout mouse strains in viral pathogenesis, and may also be relevant to the causation of HSV hepatitis in humans, a rare but frequently fatal infection.

The assay uses a nonstructural 3D recombinant protein and two polyclonal antisera, one for capture (bovine) and the other for detector (guinea pig). The specificity of the assay was demonstrated by negative results with 101 sera of cattle from the FMD-free zone in Argentina and with bovine and porcine sera raised against various RNA and DNA viruses. The ELISA-3D was able to detect antibodies in cattle after natural or experimental infection with FMDV of A, O, or C types as early as 5 days postinfection and at later stages in persistently infected animals. Comparison of the results with those obtained with the routinely used agar gel immunodiffussion test and a previously described ELISA, both employing a partially purified virus-infection-associated antigen, shows that the ELISA-3D is highly sensitive and specific and gives reproducible results. Its use as a tool for monitoring viral activity and for certification of FMDV-free animals is recommended.																					WOS:A1996UP38800001	8744733

ZEITSCHR INFEKTIONSKR U HYG HAUS 6 TIERE				49	(3)			208	214						1936	1936	Reports of myocardial injury following foot-and-mouth disease in higher animals are common, and were confirmed in the laboratory in artificially infected guinea pigs. The lesions, mostly on the left heart, appear as yellowish-white areas due to degenerative and inflammatory changes. There is some fatty degeneration. This condition was not very common in older guinea pigs (2.7%), except in certain instances of malignant disease in which these areas were the size of a millet seed, with diffuse infiltration of fine fat globules in about 1/3 of the animals. The virus was not demonstrated in these lesions. A large number of young pigs 3-5 weeks of age exhibited heart lesions when injected with highly virulent virus. In these animals there are regressive changes in the muscle fibers following an inflammation. Both granular and fatty degeneration occurred. Since such areas were generally free of bacteria, the virus is considered to be the cause of the degeneration, either directly or indirectly. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: L. D.

We wanted to investigate how viral infections may mediate allergic symptoms in a mouse model; therefore, we infected BALB/C mice with influenza A virus intranasally. Histologic analyses of lung sections and bronchoalveolar lavages were performed. In addition, cells from the mediastinal lymph nodes were restimulated in vitro to analyze which types of cytokines were induced by the flu infection. Furthermore, flu-specific antibody titers were determined and local anaphylaxis was measured after rechallenge with flu antigen. We found that airways inflammation consisted predominately of macrophages and lymphocytes, whereas only a few eosinophils were observed. interferon-gamma but no interleukin-4 and little interleukin-5 could be detected in the culture supernatants from in vitro restimulated T cells from the draining lymph nodes. The antibody response was characterized by high levels of virus-specific IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG1 and, surprisingly, low levels of virus-specific IgE antibodies. Interestingly, flu-infected mice developed active and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis after rechallenge with flu-antigen. As the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction persisted over 48 h and was significantly lower after passive transfer of the serum, which was IgE depleted, local anaphylaxis seemed to be mediated predominately by specific IgE antibodies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that mice infected with flu virus develop virus-specific mast cell degranulation in the skin. Our results may also have implications for the pathogenesis of urticaria or other atopic disorders in humans.																					WOS:000174645200012	11918711

The incidence and mechanisms by which mixed infection occurs in free-living mice are unknown. This study used two approaches to determine whether mixed infection with MCMV could be established in laboratory mice. The first utilized two naturally occurring MCMV strains, N1 and G4, into which the lacZ gene was inserted by homologous recombination. The lacZ gene was used to track recombinant and parental viruses in simultaneously coinfected mice. In the second approach, a real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was used to detect viral immediate-early 1 (ie1) gene sequences in mice successively coinfected with G4 and then with the K181 MCMV strain. In both systems, mixed infection was detected in the salivary glands and lungs of experimentally infected mice. MCMV-specific antibody in sera and G4 IE1-specific cytotoxic lymphocyte responses in the spleens of twice-infected mice did not prevent reinfection. Finally, the prevalence of mixed infection in free-living mice trapped in four Australian locations was investigated using real-time qPCR to detect ie1 DNA sequences of N1, G4 and K181. Mixed infection with MCMVs containing the G4 and K181 ie1 sequences was detected in the salivary glands of 34.2% of trapped mice. The observations that mixed infections are common in free-living M. domesticus and are acquired by immunocompetent mice through simultaneous or successive infections are important for vaccine development.

Nearly 30% of all recently diagnosed cases of myocarditis are attributable to infection with coxsackie B virus (CBV), the most frequently associated pathogen. CBV initially replicates in the pancreas and quickly spreads to the heart, inducing chronic autoimmunity. To determine whether immunosuppressive cytokines could act to limit the extent of autoimmunity to the heart, we infected transgenic mice that express immunosuppressive cytokines in the pancreas. Herein, we demonstrate that transgenic expression of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta) within the pancreatic beta cells prevented mice from developing autoimmune myocarditis after CBV infection. In contrast, transgenic expression of interleukin-4 did not inhibit virus-mediated heart disease. Furthermore, we show that TGF-beta expression reduced viral replication while promoting the recruitment of macrophages into the pancreas. These results illustrate the benefit of TGF-beta in controlling not only viral replication, but also CBV-mediated autoimmunity.																					WOS:000243346600014	17201667

Host kinases link multiple signaling pathways at various stages of infection and are attractive therapeutic target. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, regulates several cellular processes including NFkB and antiviral responses. We investigated how FAK kinase activity regulates IAV pathogenesis. Using a severe infection model, we infected IAV-susceptible DBA/2 J mice with a lethal dose of H1N1 IAV. We observed reduced viral load and pro-inflammatory cytokines, delayed mortality, and increased survival in FAK inhibitor (Y15) treated mice. In vitro IAV-induced NFkB-promoter activity was reduced by Y15 or a dominant negative kinase-dead FAK mutant (FAK-KD) independently of the viral immune modulator, NS1. Finally, we observed reduced IAV-induced nuclear localization of NFkB in FAK-KD expressing cells. Our data suggest a novel mechanism where IAV hijacks FAK to promote viral replication and limit its ability to contribute to innate immune responses.

Here we demonstrate that several strains of adult Mus musculus domesticus (C57BL/6, BALB/c, AKR/J, and SJL/J) were susceptible to Hantaan virus infection when infected intraperitoneally. First clinical signs were loss of weight, ruffled fur, and reduced activity, which were followed by neurological symptoms, such as paralyses and convulsions. Within 2 days of disease onset, the animals died of acute encephalitis. PCR analysis indicated a systemic infection with viral RNA present in all major organs. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization analyses of postmortem material detected viral antigen and RNA in the central nervous system (predominantly brain), liver, and spleen. In the central nervous system, viral antigen and RNA colocalized with perivascular infiltrations, the predominant pathological finding. To investigate the involvement of the interferon system in Hantaan virus pathogenesis, we infected alpha/beta interferon receptor knockout mice. These animals were more susceptible to Hantaan virus infection, indicating an important role of interferon-induced antiviral defense mechanisms in Hantaan virus pathogenesis. The present model may help to overcome shortcomings in the development of therapeutic and prophylactic measurements against hantavirus infections.																					WOS:000177334900039	12163608

The deaths occurred 18-72 h after a parenteral infection and up to 120 h after a contact infection. PM and histopathological examinations showed heavy hypostatic hyperaemia and pulmonary oedema. The virus presence in internal organs was confirmed by haemagglutination test, control infection and electron microscopy. The virus maintained its infection properties after filtration through Millipore filters of a diameter of 0.10 and 0.22 m, after heating at 56°C for 1h, after exposure to 5 and 10% chloroform and after lyophilization. The virus was was killed when treated with 0.4% formalin or diethyleneimine and when heated at 56°C for 4 h. Experimental infection of hares, mice, guineapigs, dogs, cats and attempts to multiplicate the virus in a cell culture gave negative results.																					CABI:19922275690

The capacity of other picornaviruses to express foreign antigens has been extensively reported, however, little is known about FMDV. To explore the potential of FMDV as a viral vector, an 11-amino-acid (aa) HSV epitope and an 8 aa FLAG epitope were introduced into the C-terminal different regions of 3A protein of FMDV full-length infectious cDNA clone. Recombinant viruses expressing the HSV or FLAG epitope were successfully rescued after transfection of both modified constructs. Immunofluorescence assay, Western blot and sequence analysis showed that the recombinant viruses stably maintained the foreign epitopes even after 11 serial passages in BHK-21 cells. The 3A-tagged viruses shared similar plaque phenotypes and replication kinetics to those of the parental virus. In addition, mice experimentally infected with the epitope-tagged viruses could induce tag-specific antibodies. Our results demonstrate that FMDV can be used effectively as a viral vector for the delivery of foreign tags.																					WOS:000306950200066	22848509

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a zoonotic respiratory disease of global public health concern, and dromedary camels are the only proven source of zoonotic infection. More than 70% of MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries are found in East, North, and West Africa, but zoonotic MERS disease is only reported from the Arabian Peninsula. We compared viral replication competence of clade A and B viruses from the Arabian Peninsula with genetically diverse clade C viruses found in East (Egypt, Kenya, and Ethiopia), North (Morocco), and West (Nigeria and Burkina Faso) Africa. Viruses from Africa had lower replication competence in ex vivo cultures of the human lung and in lungs of experimentally infected human-DPP4 (hDPP4) knockin mice. We used lentivirus pseudo types expressing MERS-CoV spike from Saudi Arabian clade A prototype strain (EMC) or African clade C1.1 viruses and demonstrated that clade C1.1 spike was associated with reduced virus entry into the respiratory epithelial cell line Calu-3. Isogenic EMC viruses with spike protein from EMC or clade C1.1 generated by reverse genetics showed that the clade C1.1 spike was associated with reduced virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells in vitro, in ex vivo human bronchus, and in lungs of hDPP4 knockin mice in vivo. These findings may explain why zoonotic MERS disease has not been reported from Africa so far, despite exposure to and infection with MERS-CoV.																					WOS:000672563300021	34099577

Here, we report a new, genetically distinct pegivirus in goose (Anser cygnoides), the first identified in a nonmammalian host species. Goose pegivirus (GPgV) can be propagated in goslings, embryonated goose eggs, and primary goose embryo fibroblasts, and is thus the first pegivirus that can be efficiently cultured in vitro. Experimental infection of GPgV in goslings via intravenous injection revealed robust replication and high lymphotropism. Analysis of the tissue tropism of GPgV revealed that the spleen and thymus were the organs bearing the highest viral loads. Importantly, GPgV could promote clinical manifestations of goose parvovirus infection, including reduced weight gain and 7% mortality. This finding contrasts with the lack of pathogenicity that is characteristic of previously reported pegiviruses.IMPORTANCE Members of the Pegivirus genus, family Flaviviridae, widely infect humans and other mammals, but are described as causing persistent infection and lacking pathogenicity. The efficiency of in vitro replication systems for pegivirus is poor, thus limiting investigation into viral replication steps. Because of that, the pathogenesis, cellular tropism, route of transmission, biology, and epidemiology of pegiviruses remain largely uncovered. Here, we report a phylogenetically distinct goose pegivirus (GPgV) that should be classified as a new species. GPgV proliferated in cell culture in a speciesand cell-type-specific manner. Animal experiments show GPgV lymphotropism and promote goose parvovirus clinical manifestations. This study provides the first cell culture model for pegivirus, opening new possibilities for studies of pegivirus molecular biology. More importantly, our findings stand in contrast to the lack of identified pathogenicity of previously reported pegiviruses, which sheds lights on the pathobiology of pegivirus.

Mice have been widely used to study the pathogenesis of several human and animal viruses, especially herpesviruses. This study aimed to verify whether BALB/c mice are susceptible to FHV-1 infection. The animals were intranasally inoculated with FHV-1 and their clinical signs were observed from 3 days post infection (dpi). At 10 dpi, the animals were euthanized and the lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys were collected for histopathological examination and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that mice were infected with FHV-1 and reproduced several features of the disease observed in its natural host. Histological lesions and viral DNA were found in all sampled tissues, with a higher frequency of FHV-1 DNA copies detected in the lungs. All mice were seroconverted to FHV-1 at 7 dpi. To our knowledge, this is the first report of experimental infection of BALB/c mice with FHV-1. Our findings demonstrate that this murine model can contribute to understanding of FHV-1 pathogenesis and may be useful for trials against this virus.																					WOS:000727409300004

The outcome of viral encephalitis is partially determined by genetically programed immune response patterns of the host. Experimental infection of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) causes diverse neurologic diseases, including TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD), depending on the used mouse strain. The aim of the present study was to compare initial transcriptomic changes occurring in the brain of TMEV-infected SJL (TMEV-IDD susceptible) and C57BL/6 (TMEV-IDD resistant) mice. Animals were infected with TMEV and sacrificed 4, 7, or 14 days post infection. RNA was isolated from brain tissue and analyzed by whole-transcriptome sequencing. Selected differences were confirmed on a protein level by immunohistochemistry. In mock-infected SJL and C57BL/6 mice, >200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected. Following TMEV-infection, the number of DEGs increased to >700. Infected C57BL/6 mice showed a higher expression of transcripts related to antigen presentation via major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I, innate antiviral immune responses and cytotoxicity, compared with infected SJL animals. Expression of many of those genes was weaker or delayed in SJL mice, associated with a failure of viral clearance in this mouse strain. SJL mice showed prolonged elevation of MHC II and chemotactic genes compared with C57BL/6 mice, which presumably facilitates the induction of chronic demyelinating disease. In addition, elevated expression of several genes associated with immunomodulatory or -suppressive functions was observed in SJL mice. The exploratory study confirms previous observations in the model and provides an extensive list of new immunologic parameters potentially contributing to different outcomes of viral encephalitis in two mouse strains.

Murine cytomegalovirus carries a CC (beta) chemokine homolog gene giving rise to two related proteins, murine cytomegalovirus chemokine 1 and 2 (MCK-1 and MCK-2). MCK-1 peptide was found to induce calcium signaling and adherence in murine peritoneal macrophages. Cells bearing human chemokine receptor CCR3 and the human macrophage THP1 cell line were responsive to MCK-1. This pattern suggested that MCK-1 might act as an agonist, promoting leukocyte trafficking during viral infection. Consistent with this prediction, MCK-1/MCK-2 mutant viruses exhibit dramatically reduced peak levels of monocyte-associated viremia in experimentally infected mice. Thus, MCK-1/MCK-2 appears to promote host leukocyte migration to initial sites of infection and may be responsible for attracting monocytes or macrophages that efficiently disseminate virus in the host.

J	Sandra Cuevas-Romero, Julieta; Francisco Rivera-Benitez, Jose; Hernandez-Baumgarten, Eliseo; Hernandez-Jauregui, Pablo; Vega, Marco; Blomstrom, Anne-Lie; Berg, Mikael; Baule, Claudia								Cloning, expression and characterization of potential immunogenic recombinant hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein of Porcine rubulavirus								PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION				128				1	7		10.1016/j.pep.2016.08.002				DEC 2016	2016	Blue eye disease caused by Porcine rubulavirus (PorPV) is an endemic viral infection of swine causing neurological and respiratory disease in piglets, and reproductive failure in sows and boars. The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of PorPV is the most abundant component in the viral envelope and the main target of the immune response in infected animals. In this study, we expressed the HN-PorPV-recombinant (rHN-PorPV) protein in an Escherichia coli system and analyzed the immune responses in mice. The HN gene was cloned from the reference strain PorPV-La Piedad Michoacan Virus (GenBank accession number BK005918), into the pDual expression vector. The expressed protein was identified at a molecular weight of 61.7 kDa. Three-dimensional modeling showed that the main conformational and functional domains of the rHN-PorPV protein were preserved. The antigenicity of the expressed protein was confirmed by Western blot with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the HN, and by testing against serum samples from pigs experimentally infected with PorPV. The immunogenicity of the rHN-PorPV protein was tested by inoculation of BALB/c mice with AbISCO-100 (R) as adjuvant. Analysis of the humoral immune responses in mice showed an increased level of specific antibodies 14 days after the first immunization, compared to the control group (P < 0.0005). The results show the ability of the rHN-PorPV protein to induce an antibody response in mice. Due to its immunogenic potential, the rHN-PorPV protein will be further evaluated in pig trials for its suitability for prevention and control of blue eye disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

However, little is known about how chronic viral infection influences lymphocyte reconstitution after bone marrow transplantation. To address this, we infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and performed bone marrow transplantation to assess lymphocyte reconstitution. Interestingly, we observed that adoptively transferred marrow cells exhibited preferential B cell differentiation in chronically infected mice. Moreover, donor marrow cells that were adoptively transferred into chronically infected mice differentiated into virus-specific CD8 T cells that were able to expand after PD-L1 blockade. Taken together, our data show that chronic viral infection induces a biased differentiation of bone marrow stem cells into B cells, and that exhausted virus-specific CD8 T cells generated de novo in this setting are rescuable by PD-1 blockade. These data contribute to the understanding of how chronic viral infection impacts lymphocyte reconstitution, and may provide valuable information to improve current hematopoietic transplantation regimens in chronically infected hosts.

Expansion and activation of NK cell populations in a gammaherpesvirus infection								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				67	5			489	495		10.1111/j.1365-3083.2008.02100.x				MAY 2008	2008	NK cells are an important component of the innate immune response to many virus infections. In particular, they play a major role in control of alpha and beta herpesvirus infections in humans and mice and there is evidence for a protective role in Epstein-Barr virus infection. MHV-68 has been widely used to study gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis and provides a tractable means of investigating the role of NK cells in gammaherpesvirus infections. We have shown that, following MHV-68 infection of mice, the NK cell population is expanded and activated and capable of cytotoxic killing in vitro. However, depletion of NK cells prior to MHV-68 infection did not affect viral loads in vivo. To investigate the possibility that MHV-68 was downregulating NK cell activity in vivo and evading the NK cell response, we infected NK cell-depleted mice with the related virus, MHV-76, which lacks a 9.5 kb region of the genome known to be involved in modulating the host immune response. Infection of NK cell-depleted mice with MHV-76 did not result in increased viral loads indicating that genes within this region do not encode products which modulate NK cell activity.

Cyclosporin A in various doses exerted on effect on the outcome of the acute infection. The adoptive transfer of splenocytes from mouse donors inoculated intraperitoneally prevented the development of lethal disease symptoms and death of mice-recipients.

Anti-HVJ antibody (Ab) was detected in 35/42 mice in the rack. To specify the strain of Inf.V contaminated with HVJ, experimental infection was performed by using A, B and D strains of Inf.V in each vinyl isolator. Anti-HVJ Ab was detected in all mice infected with A strain at day 28 post-infection. As a result of experimental infection with A strain of Inf.V which was treated with anti-HVJ mouse serum, the virus suspension was determined not to contain HVJ and allowed for experimental use in our facility.

J	DAL CANTO M C; LIPTON H L								ULTRASTRUCTURAL IMMUNO HISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION OF VIRUS IN ACUTE AND CHRONIC DE MYELINATING THEILERS VIRUS INFECTION								American Journal of Pathology				106	1			20	29						1982	1982	Mice experimentally infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) develop a persistent infection of the CNS. The most striking feature of this infection is the occurrence of inflammatory primary demyelination in the spinal cord white matter. The pathogenesis of myelin degeneration in this model has not been clarified, but morphologic and immunologic data suggest that the host immune response plays a major role in the production of myelin injury. Because of low virus titers in infected adult mice and of the small size of TMEV, virus particles have never been observed in this demyelinating model. Yet elucidation of the types of cells in the CNS supporting virus replication would be important for a better understanding of both virus persistence and virus-induced demyelinating pathology. The localization of TMEV in the spinal cord of infected mice by ultrastructural immunohistochemical techniques is described. Virus replication is mainly in neurons during the acute phase of the disease, while in the chronic phase viral inclusions are mainly found in macrophages in and around demyelinating lesions. Other cells are also infected but to a lesser degree. In the neuronal system both axoplasmic and dendritic flow appear to facilitate the spread of virus in the CNS. In macrophages, the presence of virus particles and the association of virus with altered components of the cytoskeleton support active virus production rather than simple internalization. The macrophage appears to play an important role in both the establishment of virus persistence and in the process of demyelination in this animal model.																					BCI:BCI198274018403

The virus that replicated in the human cells was characterized as a mouse virus by immunofluorescence, EM and the presence of a specific RNA-directed DNA polymerase. The cells themselves were human as per the karyotype and isoenzyme migration patterns. Human cells are apparently susceptible to the mouse mammary tumor virus and can, eventually, support its replication.																					BCI:BCI198069038669		
J	LIEOU, Y. C.								Carriers of rabies virus.								Chinese Medical Journal				66				694	699						1948	1948	The author defines a carrier of rabies virus as "one who with all the external signs of good health bears nevertheless in his organism a virus detectable either by experimental inoculation or by microscopical examination." He divides carriers into four categories according to localization of virus, viz., in the brain, blood, saliva and subcutaneous tissues. The following paragraphs summarize his presentation of the subject: -Virus carried in the brain.-Experimentally virus after intracerebral inoculation may lie latent unaltered and without causing symptoms for long periods (90-302 days respectively) in the brain of the fresh water turtle and land tortoise-coldblooded animals refractory to rabies- and for shorter periods up to 23 days in pigeons-warm-blooded and relatively insusceptible to rabies [probably because of their high body temperature] (phenomenon of permanence). In dogs inoculated subdurally the virus may disappear from the brain for several days and then reappear (eclipse phenomenon). Under natural condition's the virus may remain dormant for months even years in the brain of man especially in the inadequately treated until suddenly awakened to action by stimuli such as trauma cold or emotional upset.Virus carried in the blood.-Experimentally the presence of virus in the blood of rabbits 4-5 days after subdural inoculation has been demonstrated by MARIE & URBAIN [V.B. 3. 247]. The present author also has shown that rabbits inoculated intraperitoneally may early contain virus in their blood and remain unaffected throughout a four months' period of observation. In nature, as stated by REMLINGER and by KONRADI, a female animal can transmit rabies to its offspring by way of the placental circulation. [These findings and observations are not generally accepted. Many workers on rabies consider that the blood is non-infectious in man and in experimental animals and that virus cannot be conveyed to the fetus. Other workers believe that, after experimental inoculation, the blood rarely proves infectious, i.e., rarely contains virus; in positive findings the appearance of virus is but momentary.]Virus in the saliva.-Animals generally transmit rabies by their saliva; this group of carriers is, therefore, most important from a practical point of view. A dog in the incubation period of the disease may, when apparently healthy, convey rabies by its bite, inasmuch as it may have virus in its salivary glands as early as 10-11 days before showing first symptoms. [How long virus is present in the saliva before the animals becomes outwardly ill is not established, but it is probably 2-5 days.] Recovery from rabies is relatively frequent in adult birds. Should a dog recover, it remains a carrier of virus. [According to REMLINGER the saliva of a dog remains virulent five days after recovery. Most workers, who have studied experimental rabies in dogs, have noted apparent recovery from paralytic disease. There is no record, however, of isolation of rabies virus from the saliva of a naturally infected dog that eventually recovered. Moreover, with the possible exception of the dog reported by REMLINGER (1907), it has been impossible to isolate the virus from the saliva of experimentally infected dogs that did not succumb. It should be noted that REMLINGER'S findings were in respect of a dog which had been inoculated with fixed virus and that other investigators have failed to isolate virus from the salivary glands of dogs infected with fixed virus.]Virus carried subcutaneously.-All individuals, who receive anti-rabies vaccine prepared according to the method of PASTEUR, HOEGYES or FERMI, must at some time during the course of treatment harbour virus subcutaneously. In dogs immunized with wholly inactivated vaccine, rabies virus, on later introduction by a biting animal, rapidly disappears; such immunized dogs do not, therefore, become virus carriers. [Unlike all other known vectors, which transmit the disease for a limited period of time and then die of the infection, the vampire bat is capable of transmitting rabies over periods of six months as a symptomless carrier. These bats are "carriers, " in that they are infected with the virus and transmit it to others by biting-their saliva is infected- and yet are sufficiently resistant to hold it in check in their tissues without developing the disease and succumbing to it. In rabies, then, as in other infections, their exist healthy carriers of the virus which are capable of transmitting the virus and, consequently, the disease.].

Impairment in reactivation of a latency associated transcript (LAT)-deficient HSV-2 is not solely dependent on the latent viral load or the number of CD8(+) T cells infiltrating the ganglia								VIROLOGY				387	1			193	199		10.1016/j.virol.2009.02.004				APR 25 2009	2009	The HSV latency-associated transcript (LAT) is abundantly expressed during virus latency. Previous studies have shown that the latent viral load and CD8(+) T cells in ganglia influence the rate of reactivation of HSV. While LAT is important for efficient reactivation and establishment of latency, it is uncertain how LAT affects either the HSV latent viral load or CD8(+) T cell infiltration of ganglia. We infected mice with LAT-deficient or LAT-restored HSV-2 at a wide range of inocula. We found that the reduced rate of spontaneous ex-vivo reactivation of the LAT-deficient virus Was not associated with a higher number of CD8(+) T cells in the ganglia. Reactivation rates were lower for LAT-deficient than LAT restored HSV-2 even when the latent viral loads were similar, indicating that differences in reactivation were not solely dependent on the latent viral load. Therefore, LAT likely has additional functions important for reactivation. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.																					WOS:000265561800022	19269661

J	Shin MinNa; Kim JiNi; Park Jeongho; Hahn TaeWook								Clinical profile of Asian and African strains of Zika virus in immunocompetent mice.								Korean Journal of Veterinary Research				61	2						10.14405/kjvr.2021.61.e12				2021	2021	The mosquito-borne pathogen Zika virus may result in neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and microcephaly. The virus is classified as a member of the Flaviviridae family and its wide spread in multiple continents is a significant threat to public health. So, there is a need to develop animal models to examine the pathogenesis of the disease and develop vaccines. To examine the clinical profile during Zika virus infection, we infected neonatal and adult wild-type mice (C57BL/6 and Balb/c) and compared the clinical signs of African-lineage strain (MR766) and Asian-lineage strain (PRVABC59, MEX2-81) of Zika virus. Consistent with previous reports, eight-week-old female Balb/c mice infected with these viral strains showed changes in body weight, survival rate, and no neurologic signs, but demonstrated increases in the weights of spleens and hearts. However, one-day-old neonates showed significantly lower survival rate and body weight with the African-lineage strain than the Asian-lineage strain. These results confirmed the pathogenic differences between Zika virus strains. We also evaluated the clinical responses in neonatal and adult mice of different strains. Our findings suggest that these are useful mouse models for characterization of Zika virus for vaccine development.																					CABI:20210323262

To test for multiple agents, these methods consume large volumes of mouse serum and are laborious and time-consuming. More efficient immunoassays, using small amounts of sample, are therefore needed. Accordingly, we have developed a novel multiplex diagnostic system that employs fluorescent microbeads, coated with purified antigens, for simultaneous serodetection of 10 mouse infectious agents. Individually identifiable, fluorescent microbeads were coated with antigens from Sendai virus, mouse hepatitis virus, Theiler's mouse encephalomyelitis virus/GDVII strain, mouse minute virus, mouse cytomegalovirus, respiratory enteric orphan virus (Reo-3 virus), mouse parvovirus, calf rotavirus for epizootic diarrhea virus of infant mice, vaccinia virus for ectromelia virus, and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Standard sera, singly positive for antibodies to individual infectious agents, were generated by inoculation of BAILB/cj and C57BL/6j mice. Sera from these experimentally infected mice, as well as sera from naturally infected mice, were analyzed using a mixture of microbeads coated with antigens of the 10 infectious agents listed above. Results demonstrated that the multiplex assay was at least as sensitive and specific as ELISA for serodetection. Importantly, the multiplex assay required only 1 microliter of serum for simultaneous serodetection of the 10 mouse infectious agents in one reaction vessel. Thus, this multiplex microbead assay is a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective diagnostic modality that will impact serosurveillance of mice used in research.

We found that 40% of young beta(2)m(-/-) mice were shedding virus from the lung on day 9 (mean titer of 0.3 log(10) TCID50), with a maximal anti-influenza class II CTL activity of 68 +/- 2% on day 7. In contrast, 100% of aged beta(2)m(-/-) mice were still shedding virus (mean titer of 3.0 log(10) TCID50) from the lung on day 9 with a peak CTL activity of 15 +/- 6%, Aged beta(2)m(-/-) mice also had significantly lower pulmonary IFN-gamma levels, serum anti-influenza neutralizing Ab, and anti-influenza mucosal IgA titers, as well as a less intense pulmonary inflammatory response on early days of infection, Th2-mediated cytokines were dysregulated, We conclude that there are multiple mechanisms responsible for the age-related delay in recovery from influenza, These include decreased anti-influenza class Ii-restricted CTL activity, pulmonary IFN-gamma levels, and serum neutralizing Ab, Taken together, these findings show a loss of CD4(+) T cell functions with aging.

The virus, designated a mouse ''orphan'' parvovirus (OPV), was also localized in tissues of experimentally infected random-bred, inbred, and immunodeficient mice by in situ hybridization. Hybridization signal was seen in exocrine and endocrine pancreas, abdominal lymph nodes, mesentery, intestine, and sporadically in other tissues of Sencar, C3H, and DBA mice inoculated as infants. In adult BALB/c severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice, signal was seen in lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and intestine but not in pancreas. Transmission of OPV by Sencar mice inoculated as infants was intermittent, whereas transmission by Sencar mice inoculated as weanlings was consistent during the first 2 weeks both by direct contact and by exposure to soiled bedding. The longest duration of transmission was 6 weeks among mice inoculated as infants. The results implicate a role for urinary, fecal, and perhaps respiratory excretion of virus, depending on host genotype and route of virus exposure. They also suggest that evaluation of pancreatic and immune function during acute infection is warranted.																					WOS:A1993LA76500013	8391610

Menangle virus, a pteropid bat paramyxovirus infectious for pigs and humans, exhibits tropism for secondary lymphoid organs and intestinal epithelium in weaned pigs								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				93				1007	1016		10.1099/vir.0.038448-0				MAY 2012	2012	This study is the first report of experimental infection and transmission of Menangle virus (MenPV) in pigs. Isolated in 1997 from piglets that were stillborn at a large commercial piggery in New South Wales, Australia, MenPV is a recently identified paramyxovirus of bat origin that causes severe reproductive disease in pigs and an influenza-like illness, with a rash, in humans. Although successfully eradicated from the infected piggery, the virus was only isolated from affected fetuses and stillborn piglets during the period of reproductive disease, and thus the mode of transmission between pigs was not established. To investigate the pathogenesis of MenPV, we undertook time-course studies in 6-week-old pigs following intranasal administration of a low-passage, non-plaque-purified isolate from the lung of an infected stillborn piglet. Viraemia was of short duration and low titre, as determined by real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation. Following an incubation period of 2-3 days, virus was shed in nasal and oral secretions, faeces and urine, typically for less than 1 week. Cessation of shedding correlated with the development of neutralizing antibodies in sera. Secondary lymphoid organs and intestine were identified, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, as major sites of viral replication and dissemination, and this was confirmed by positive immunolabelling of viral antigen within various lymphoid tissues and intestinal epithelium. These data provide new insights into the pathogenesis of MenPV in weaned pigs, and will facilitate future control and eradication programmes should it ever re-emerge in the pig population.

Similar activities were observed with anti-gC1 monoclonal antibody B1C1. In addition to HaCaT and L cells, B1C1 antibody neutralized HSV-1 infectivity in simian GMK AH1 cells mildly pre-treated with heparinase III. Human anti-gC1 antibodies efficiently competed with the binding of gC1 to B1C1 antibody whose epitope overlaps a part of the attachment domain of gC1. Human anti-gC1 and B1C1 antibodies extended survival time of mice experimentally infected with HSV-1. We conclude that in HaCaT cells and in cell systems showing restricted expression of glycosaminoglycans, human and some monoclonal anti-gC1 antibodies can target the cell-binding domain of this protein and neutralize viral infectivity.

Goats developed thermal reactions and various lesions after i/d, i/v, intra-testicular, intratracheal, intracorneal, but not s/c, inj. of nodule suspension; after i/v inj., the only lesions seen internally were in lungs and lymph nodes. The virus was passaged in goat testicles.An i/d challenge of a single goat, recovered from experimental infection, failed to produce nodules. Inactivated hyperimmune or immune goat serum had definite neutralizing activity only when mixed with fresh, normal goat serum. This suggested that a heat-labile factor was involved in effective virus-antibody binding. Fatal anaphylactic reactions were observed in all g.pigs given intracardial inj. of 20% nodule suspension 24 hours after i/d inj. of hyperimmune goat serum. Gel diffusion tests in tubes, using 1% Difco agar and 1.5% NaCl, gave two precipitin bands with the homologous system. Antigens reacting in the tube test failed to react in the slide test.-TW.																					CABI:19692203326		
J	Reynaud, Josephine M.; Horvat, Branka								Animal models for human herpesvirus 6 infection								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				4						174	10.3389/fmicb.2013.00174				JUL 4 2013	2013	Human herpesvirus (HHV)-6A and HHV-6B are two enveloped DNA viruses of beta-herpesvirus family, infecting over 90% of the population and associated with several diseases, including exanthema subitum (for HHV-6B), multiple sclerosis and encephalitis, particularly in immunosuppressed patients. Animal models are highly important to better understand the pathogenesis of viral infections. Naturally developed neutralizing antibodies to HHV-6 or a related virus were found in different species of monkeys, suggesting their susceptibility to HHV-6 infection. Both HHV-6 DNA and infectious virus were detected in experimentally infected Cynomolgus and African green monkeys, although most animals remained clinically asymptomatic. Furthermore, HHV-6A infection was shown to accelerate the progression of AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) in macaques and to lead to the development of neurological symptoms in the marmoset model. Humanized SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice efficiently replicated HHV-6 and were also susceptible to coinfection with HHV-6 and HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus 1). As CD46 was identified as a receptor for HHV-6, transgenic mice expressing human CD46 may present a potentially interesting model for study certain aspects of HHV-6 infection and neuroinflammation.

Multidisciplinary Approach to Epizootiology and Pathogenesis of Bat Rabies Viruses in the United States								ZOONOSES AND PUBLIC HEALTH				60	1	SI		46	57		10.1111/zph.12019				FEB 2013	2013	Zoonotic disease surveillance is typically initiated after an animal pathogen has caused disease in humans. Early detection of potentially high-risk pathogens within animal hosts may facilitate medical interventions to cope with an emerging disease. To effectively spillover to a novel host, a pathogen may undergo genetic changes resulting in varying transmission potential in the new host and potentially to humans. Rabies virus (RABV) is one model pathogen to consider for studying the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases under both laboratory and field conditions. The evolutionary history of RABV is characterized by regularly documented spillover infections and a series of notable host shifts. Within this context, enhanced field surveillance to improve detection of spillover infections will require validated techniques to non-invasively differentiate infected from non-infected individuals. In this study, we evaluate the use of infrared thermography to detect thermal changes associated with experimental RABV infection in big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in a captive colony. Our results indicated that 62% of rabid bats had detectable facial temperature decreases (-4.6 degrees C, SD +/- 2.5) compared with pre-inoculation baseline values. These data suggest potential utility for discriminating rabid bats in natural field settings. In addition, focusing upon RABV circulating in the United States between 2008 and 2011, we confirmed spillover events of bat RABV among carnivores and identified cross-species transmission events caused by four lineages of RABV associated with insectivorous bats. Additionally, our analysis of RABV glycoprotein sequences identified substitutions in antigenic sites that may affect neutralizing activity associated with monoclonal antibodies proposed for use in human post-exposure prophylaxis. This study provides a glimpse into RABV pathobiology and spillover dynamics among and between bats and a variety of mesocarnivores.																					WOS:000313487000005	23137052

Dengue transmission model by means of viremic adult immuno-competent mouse.								Parasites and Vectors				7	143			(31 March 2014)	(31 March 2014)						2014	2014	Background: Dengue virus infection manifests in three distinct forms in humans: dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and dengue shock syndrome. Infection with the virus is a fatal disease; no vaccine is available and prevention depends on interruption of the chain of transmission. The study of dengue viral transmission by mosquitoes is hindered due to the lack of an affordable animal model. In general, immuno-competent mice are used as a simple and inexpensive animal model, but mice are not susceptible to dengue virus infection and therefore viremia will not occur following the inoculation of the virus in such mice. Here, we report a method for creating artificial viremia in immuno-competent mice, and further demonstrate the use of viremic mice to simultaneously infect a large number of Aedes aegypti. Methods: We infected K562 cells with DENV-2 in the presence of an antibody against DENV-4. We then incubated the cells for 2 d before injecting the infected cells into C3H mice. After 5 h incubation, we allowed 100-150 female Aedes aegypti to feed on blood from the mice directly. We collected blood samples from the mice and from randomly selected Ae. aegypti at 2, 6, 12, and 24 h post-blood meal and screened the samples for DENV-2 genome as well as for virus concentration. Results: Our procedure provided high virus concentrations in the mice for at least 7 h after viral inoculation. We found that 13 out of 14 randomly picked mosquitoes were infected with DENV-2. High concentrations of virus were detected in the mosquitoes until at least 12 h post-infection. Conclusions: Using the viremic immuno-competent mouse, we show that mass infection of Ae. aegypti is achievable. Compared to other infection techniques using direct inoculation, membrane-feeding, or immuno-deficient/humanized mice, we are confident that this method will provide a simpler and more efficient infection technique.

R	Lee, Myeong Sup; Jeong, Yun Hee; Kim, Young-Joon; Park, Chan Hee; Ha, Sang-Jun								Negative Regulation of Type I IFN Expression by OASL1 Permits Chronic Viral Infection and CD8+ T-Cell Exhaustion								Figshare															2016-01-15	2013	The type I interferons (IFN-Is) are critical not only in early viral control but also in prolonged T-cell immune responses. However, chronic viral infections such as those of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice overcome this early IFN-I barrier and induce viral persistence and exhaustion of T-cell function. Although various T-cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic factors are known to contribute to induction of chronic conditions, the roles of IFN-I negative regulators in chronic viral infections have been largely unexplored. Herein, we explored whether 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthetase-like 1 (OASL1), a recently defined IFN-I negative regulator, plays a key role in the virus-specific T-cell response and viral defense against chronic LCMV. To this end, we infected Oasl1 knockout and wild-type mice with LCMV CL-13 (a chronic virus) and monitored T-cell responses, serum cytokine levels, and viral titers. LCMV CL-13-infected Oasl1 KO mice displayed a sustained level of serum IFN-I, which was primarily produced by splenic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, during the very early phase of infection (2-3 days post-infection). Oasl1 deficiency also led to the accelerated elimination of viremia and induction of a functional antiviral CD8 T-cell response, which critically depended on IFN-I receptor signaling. Together, these results demonstrate that OASL1-mediated negative regulation of IFN-I production at an early phase of infection permits viral persistence and suppresses T-cell function, suggesting that IFN-I negative regulators, including OASL1, could be exciting new targets for preventing chronic viral infection.

We hypothesized that a vasculotropic virus could induce neointimal lesions in the S100A4/Mts1 mouse by facilitating breakdown of elastin and migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. To test this hypothesis, we infected S100A4/Mts1 mice with gammaherpesvirus 68 (gamma HV68). We observed, 6 mo after gamma HV68 [ 4 X 10(3) plaque-forming units (PFU)], perivascular inflammation in 10/15 S100A4/Mts1 mice and occlusive neointimal formation in 3/10 mice, accompanied by striking degradation of elastin. We then compared the early response after high-dose gamma HV68 ( 4 X 10(6) PFU) in C57B1/6 and S100A4/Mts1 mice. In S100A4/Mts1 mice only, significant PAH, muscularization of distal vessels, and elastase activity were observed 6 wk after gamma HV68. These features resolved by 3 mo without neointimal formation. We therefore infected mice with the M1-gamma HV68 strain that reactivates from latency with higher efficiency and observed neointimal lesions at 3 mo in 2/5 C57B1/6 (5-9% of vessels) and in 5/5 S100A4/Mts1 mice (13-40% of vessels) accompanied by mild PAH, heightened lung elastase activity, and intravascular viral expression. This suggested that enhanced generation of elastin peptides in S100A4/Mts1 mice may promote increased viral entry in the vessel wall. Using S100A4/Mts1 PA organ culture, we showed, in response to elastase activity, heightened production of elastin peptides associated with invasion of inflammatory cells and intravascular viral antigen. We therefore propose that early viral access to the vessel wall may be a critical determinant of the extent of vascular pathology following reactivation.

Recovery of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus in Panama: A fatal case in man								AMER J TROP MED HYG				17	(3)			432	440						1966	1966	Venezuelan encephalomyelitis virus (VEE) was isolated for the first time in Panama in 1961, the source of the virus being a young boy who succumbed to a fulminating febrile illness without gross clinical signs of encephalomyelitis. Pathologic changes were similar to those reported in experimentally infected guinea pigs and some horses and dogs. Serologic characterization of the isolate permitted differentiation from 2 recently reported new members of the "VEE complex." Further evidence for the validity of the source of virus was an outbreak of virologically documented VEE infection in laboratory personnel working with the Panama virus in the absence of temporal importation of any potential virus-containing materials from outside the country. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors																					BCI:BCI19684900112256

ZIKV persists in the semen months after the acute viremic phase in humans. To further understand the consequences of ZIKV persistence in males, we infected Ifnar1(-/-) mice via subcutaneous injection of a pathogenic but nonlethal ZIKV strain. ZIKV replication persists within the testes even after clearance from the blood, with interstitial, testosterone-producing Leydig cells supporting virus replication. We found high levels of viral RNA and antigen within the epididymal lumen, where sperm is stored, and within surrounding epithelial cells. Unexpectedly, at 21 days post-infection, the testes of the ZIKV-infected mice were significantly smaller compared to those of mock-infected mice, indicating progressive testicular atrophy. ZIKV infection caused a reduction in serum testosterone, suggesting that male fertility can be affected. Our findings have important implications for nonvector-borne vertical transmission, as well as long-term potential reproductive deficiencies, in ZIKV-infected males.

The optimal condition of RT-PCR was obtained by a serial tests. The results showed that the nuclear acid sequence of the PCR product was similar with those of 71V-1658 strain (Accession no: NC_003408). The lower limit of RT-PCR detection determined using WEEV RNA extracted from serial dilutions of virus in infected mouse brain tissues was approximately 10(-7) dilutions. The RT-PCR assay could be reliably used as an efficient and rapid protocol of detecting WEEV in experimentally infected mosquitoes and Leghorn chicken.																					BCI:BCI200800212852

Antibody Breadth and Protective Efficacy Are Increased by Vaccination with Computationally Optimized Hemagglutinin but Not with Polyvalent Hemagglutinin-Based H5N1 Virus-Like Particle Vaccines								CLINICAL AND VACCINE IMMUNOLOGY				19	2			128	139		10.1128/CVI.05533-11				FEB 2012	2012	One of the challenges for developing an H5N1 influenza vaccine is the diversity of antigenically distinct isolates within this subtype. Previously, our group described a novel hemagglutinin (HA) derived from a methodology termed computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA). This COBRA HA, when used as an immunogen, elicits a broad antibody response against H5N1 isolates from different clades. In this report, the immune responses elicited by the COBRA HA virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine were compared to responses elicited by a mixture of VLPs expressing representative HA molecules from clade 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 primary H5N1 isolates (polyvalent). The COBRA HA VLP vaccine elicited higher-titer antibodies to a panel of H5N1 HA proteins than did the other VLPs. Both COBRA and polyvalent vaccines protected vaccinated mice and ferrets from experimental infection with highly lethal H5N1 influenza viruses, but COBRA-vaccinated animals had decreased viral replication, less inflammation in the lungs of mice, and reduced virus recovery in ferret nasal washes. Both vaccines had similar cellular responses postchallenge, indicating that higher-titer serum antibodies likely restrict the duration of viral replication. Furthermore, passively transferred immune serum from the COBRA HA VLP-vaccinated mice protected recipient animals more efficiently than immune serum from polyvalent-vaccinated mice. This is the first report comparing these two vaccine strategies. The single COBRA HA antigen elicited a broader antibody response and reduced morbidity and viral titers more effectively than a polyvalent mixture of primary H5N1 HA antigens.

We infected chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) with ASLV or HIV and sequenced 863 junctions between host and viral DNA. The relationship with cellular gene activity was analyzed by transcriptional profiling of uninfected or ASLV-infected CEF cells. ASLV weakly favored integration in active transcription units (TUs), and HIV strongly favored active TUs, trends seen previously for integration in human cells. The ERVs, in contrast, accumulated mostly outside TUs, including ERVs related to ASLV. The minority of ERVs present within TUs were mainly in the antisense orientation; consequently, the viral splicing and polyadenylation signals would not disrupt cellular mRNA synthesis. In contrast, de novo ASLV integration sites within TUs showed no orientation bias. Comparing the distribution of de novo ASLV integration sites to ERVs indicated that purifying selection against gene disruption, and not initial integration targeting, probably determined the ERV distribution. Further analysis indicated that ERVs in humans, mice, and rats showed similar distributions, suggesting purifying selection dictated their distributions as well.

Immunocompetent mice infected with VEE exhibited a biphasic illness characterized by an early self-limiting lymphoid phase and a fatal CNS phase, The lymphoid phase of the illness was characterized by extensive viral replication within spleen, thymus, Peyer's patches, and lymph nodes, was accompanied by a high-titered serum viremia, and resolved with the production of VEE-specific ISM class antibody at 72 h postinfection (p.i.). Immunocompetent animals survived an average of 6.8 +/- 1.2 days before succumbing to fulminant encephalitis. In contrast, SCID mice infected with VEE showed a persistent replication of virus throughout all organs tested beginning at 24 h p,i. VEE-infected SCID mice exhibited a severe spongiform encephalopathy with 100% mortality and an average survival time of 8.9 +/- 0.9 days. These studies indicated that the characteristic organ tropism of VEE in the mouse is due in large part to an early anti-viral state, the establishment of which is dependent upon the presence of an intact immune system. Finally, the CNS pathology in a VEE-infected mouse had a significant immunologic component, However, in contrast to other neurovirulent alphaviruses, VEE was directly cytopathic for the cells of the CNS, even in the absence of an immune response.

Remarkably, in contrast to the recombinant wild-type FPV (rFPV), the reassortant virus was able to replicate more efficiently in different human cell lines and primary mouse epithelia cells without prior adaptation. Moreover, FPV NS GD caused disease and death in experimentally infected mice and was detected in mouse lungs; in contrast, rFPV was not able to replicate in mice effectively. These results indicated an altered host range and increased virulence. Furthermore FPV NS GD showed pronounced pathogenicity in chicken embryos. In an attempt to define the molecular basis for the apparent differences, we determined that NS1 proteins of the H5N1 and H7N1 strains bound the antiviral kinase PKR and the F2F3 domain of cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30 (CPSF30) with comparable efficiencies in vitro. However, FPV NS GD infection resulted in (i) increased expression of NS1, (ii) faster and stronger PKR inhibition, and (iii) stronger beta interferon promoter inhibition than rFPV. Taken together, the results shed further light on the importance of the NS segment of an H5N1 strain for viral replication, molecular pathogenicity, and host range of HPAIVs and the possible consequences of a reassortment between naturally occurring H7 and H5 type HPAIVs.

Rhinovirus-Induced Macrophage Cytokine Expression Does Not Require Endocytosis or Replication								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY				50	5			974	984		10.1165/rcmb.2013-0354OC				MAY 2014	2014	Rhinovirus (RV) is responsible for the majority of virus-induced asthma exacerbations. We showed previously that RV infection of ovalbumin-sensitized and -challenged BALB/c mice induces production of type 2 cytokines from M2-polarized macrophages. In the present study, we sought to determine the mechanism of RV-induced cytokine expression. We infected bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) from BALB/c mice with RV serotype 1B, a minor group virus that infects mouse cells. Selected cultures were pretreated with IL-4, a type 2 cytokine increased in allergic asthma. RV infection of untreated cells increased messenger RNA and protein expression of the M1 cytokines TNF-alpha, CXCL1, and IL-6 but failed to induce expression of the M2 cytokines CCL22 and CCL24. Cells pretreated with IL-4 showed decreased expression of M1 cytokines but increased expression of Ym-1, Arg-1 (M2 markers), CCL22, and CCL24. Infection with ultraviolet (UV)-irradiated, replication-deficient RV elicited similar cytokine responses, suggesting that the outcome is replication independent. Consistent with this, viral RNA copy number did not increase in RV-treated BMMs or bronchoalveolar macrophages. RV-induced cytokine expression was not affected when cells were pretreated with cytochalasin D, suggesting that viral endocytosis is not required for the response. Finally, RV-induced cytokine expression and viral attachment were abolished in BMMs from myeloid differentiation factor 88 and Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 KO mice, suggesting a specific requirement of TLR2. We conclude that RV elicits a proinflammatory cytokine response in BMMs through a cell surface-mediated, TLR2-dependent mechanism that does not require viral endocytosis or replication.

Zoonoses Research				3				153	164						1966	1966	Attempts to isolate viruses from, and neutralization tests on, serum samples from Alberta snow-shoe hares (Lepus americanus) were carried out in 1961-1963. Attempted isolations were unsuccessful, but neutralizing antibodies to Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) and California encephalitis virus (CEV) were found. The incidence of CEV neutralizing antibodies in adult hares ranged from 63% to 97%. There appeared to be a period of virus activity in May and early June 1962. Complement fixation tests with serum from the field found CEV positive by the neutralization test indicated that the virus present in the study area was more closely related to the Montana snowshoe hare CEV strain than to the California BFS 283 strain or the North Dakota trivitattus virus. Up to 104.0 unweaned mouse LD50 of virus (per ml whole blood) was detected in hares experimentally infected with CEV (Montana). Virus was recovered for up to three days after exposure. WEEV antibodies were found in 0% to 18% of the adult hare population from June 1961 to April 1963. By June 1963 the incidence had abruptly risen to 95%. The incidence of WEEV neutralizing antibodies in juvenile hares also pointed to May as the time of WEEV activity. Serum from 12 of 18 Franklin's ground squirrels (Citellus franklini) also had WEEV antibodies.																					CABI:19672201233		
J	KITAOKA, MASAMI								Experimental transmission of the West Nile virus by the mosquito								JAPANESE MED JOUR				3	(2)			77	81						1950	1950	Six series of expts. on transmission of the West Nile virus by the mosquitoes Culex tritaeniorhynchus C. pipiens var. pallens and Armigeres obturbans were carried out. When C. tritaeniorhynchus and C. pipiens var. pallens were artificially infected, the LD50 of the virus in the mosquito body immediately after engorgement was 103.5 ; the virus could not be found during an extrinsic incubation period, but the multiplication of virus occurred again 9 or 12 days after engorgement and the mosquitoes became capable of producing typical symptoms in mice. The same results were obtained in 2 series of C. pipiens var. pallens by both the biting expt. and the inoculation of mosquito emulsion. These mosquitoes remained infective at least for 21 days after being artificially infected. The virus so recovered was positively identified with the West Nile virus by the neutralization test. In the 2 other series of mosquito C. pipiens var. pallens and A. obturbans, multiplication of the virus in the mosquito body could not be confirmed by the inoculation of mosquito emulsion or by biting. The opt. temp. for multiplication of the virus in mosquitoes was assumed to be between 33.5[degree] to 25.5[degree]C, and it seems likely that the failure in the 2 expts. was mainly due to the lower temp. (28.5-20.5[degree]C). || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: From auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19532700018194	14794284

Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Activity of Silver Nanoparticles in Experimental RSV Infection								VIRUSES-BASEL				11	8					732	10.3390/v11080732				AUG 2019	2019	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important etiological agent of respiratory infection in children for which no specific treatment option is available. The RSV virion contains two surface glycoproteins (F and G) that are vital for the initial phases of infection, making them critical targets for RSV therapeutics. Recent studies have identified the broad-spectrum antiviral properties of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against respiratory pathogens, such as adenovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza. AgNPs achieve this by attaching to viral glycoproteins, blocking entry into the host cell. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antiviral and immunomodulatory effects of AgNPs in RSV infection. Herein we demonstrate AgNP-mediated reduction in RSV replication, both in epithelial cell lines and in experimentally infected BALB/c mice. Marked reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1 alpha, IL-6, TNF-alpha) and pro-inflammatory chemokines (i.e., CCL2, CCL3, CCL5) was also observed. Conversely, CXCL1, G-CSF, and GM-CSF were increased in RSV-infected mice treated with AgNPs, consistent with an increase of neutrophil recruitment and activation in the lung tissue. Following experimental antibody-dependent depletion of neutrophils, the antiviral effect of AgNPs in mice treated was ablated. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo report demonstrating antiviral activity of AgNPs during RSV infection.																					WOS:000482993900034	31398832

We found Lst1 (leukocyte specific transcript 1) as one of the most promising candidate genes in the Qivr17-2 locus because it is non-functional in DBA/2 J mice. Several studies have proposed that LST1 plays a role in the immune response to inflammatory diseases in humans and has additional immune-regulatory functions. Here, we evaluated the relevance of LST1 for the host response to influenza A infection in B6-Lst1(-/-) mutant mice.Findings: To investigate the role of LST1, we infected B6-Lst1(-/-) mutant and C57BL/6 N wild-type mice with a low-virulent influenza A virus (PR8M; H1N1). Lst1 deficient mice exhibited significantly increased body weight loss at days 5 and 6 after infection and slightly increased lethality compared to infected wild-type mice. Determination of viral loads, histopathological examination and analysis of immune cell composition in bronchoalveolar lavage of infected lungs did not reveal any obvious differences between KO and wild-type mice.Conclusions: The absence of Lst1 leads to a slightly more susceptible phenotype. However, deletion of Lst1 in DBA/2 J mice alone does not explain the high susceptibility of this strain to PR8M influenza infections.																					WOS:000368768400001	26817701

However, CD8(+) T cells, which recognize antigenic peptides in the context of class I MHC molecules, are known to mediate clearance of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from spinal ganglia of experimentally infected mice, leading to the hypothesis that class I expression in the peripheral nervous system must be upregulated in response to HSV infection, In addressing this hypothesis it is shown, in BALB/c (H-2(d)) mice, that normally deficient class I transcripts transiently accumulate in peripheral nerve Schwann cells, ganglionic satellite cells, and primary sensory neurons, indicating that in each of these cell types class I expression is regulated at the transcriptional level in vivo. Furthermore, for 3-4 wk after infection, H-2K(d)/D-d antigens are expressed by satellite and Schwann cells but not neurons, suggesting additional posttranscriptional regulation of class I synthesis in neurons. Alternatively, the class I RNAs induced in neurons may not be derived from classical class I genes. Factors regulating H-2 class I expression emanate from within infected ganglia, probably from infected neurons themselves. However, induction of class I molecules was not maintained during latency, when viral gene expression in neurons is restricted to a single region within the virus repeats. These data have implications for the long-term survival of cells in HSV-infected neural tissue.																					WOS:A1994PC93800007	8064236

In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of TMPRSS2 during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection to investigate the role of TMPRSS2. Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice and TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice were used for SARS-CoV infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice were used for MERS-CoV infection. After experimental infection, TMPRSS2-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of TMPRSS2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, TMPRSS2-KO mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(I center dot C), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and in the resulting immunopathology.IMPORTANCE Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the coronavirus spike protein, making it a potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infections. Here, we examined the role of TMPRSS2 using animal models of SARSCoV and MERS-CoV infection. The results suggest that lack of TMPRSS2 in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Taken together, the results will facilitate development of novel targets for coronavirus therapy.																					WOS:000460292400021	30626688

We describe the characteristics of a pair of oseltamivir-resistant and oseltamivir-susceptible pH1N1 clinical isolates that differed by a single change (H274Y) in the neuraminidase protein. Viral fitness of pH1N1 isolates was assessed in vitro by determining replication kinetics in MDCK alpha 2,6 cells and in vivo by performing experimental infections of BALB/c mice and ferrets. Despite slightly reduced propagation of the mutant isolate in vitro during the first 24 h, the wild-type (WT) and mutant resistant viruses induced similar maximum weight loss in mice and ferrets with an identical pyrexic response in ferrets (AUC of 233.9 and 233.2, P = 0.5156). Similarly, comparable titers were obtained for the WT and the mutant strains on days 1, 3, 6 and 9 post-infection in mouse lungs and on days 1-7 in ferret nasal washes. A more important perivascular (day 6) and pleural (days 6 and 12) inflammation was noted in the lungs of mice infected with the H274Y mutant, which correlated with increased pulmonary levels of IL-6 and KC. Such increased levels of IL-6 were also observed in lymph nodes of ferrets infected with the mutant strain. Furthermore, the H274Y mutant strain was transmitted to ferrets. In conclusion, viral fitness of the H274Y pH1N1 isolate is not substantially altered and has the potential to induce severe disease and to disseminate.

J	Tu, Veronique; Abed, Yacine; Barbeau, Xavier; Carbonneau, Julie; Fage, Clement; Laguee, Patrick; Boivin, Guy								The I427T neuraminidase (NA) substitution, located outside the NA active site of an influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 variant with reduced susceptibility to NA inhibitors, alters NA properties and impairs viral fitness								ANTIVIRAL RESEARCH				137				6	13		10.1016/j.antiviral.2016.11.007				JAN 2017	2017	Emergence of pan neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI)-resistant variants constitutes a serious clinical concern. An influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 variant containing the 1427T/Q313R neuraminidase (NA) substitutions was previously identified in a surveillance study. Although these changes are not part of the NA active site, the variant showed reduced susceptibility to many NAls. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of resistance for the 1427T/Q313R substitution and its impact on the NA enzyme and viral fitness. Recombinant wild-type (WT), 1427T/Q313R and I427T A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were generated by reverse genetics and tested for their drug susceptibilities, enzymatic properties and replication kinetics in vitro as well as their virulence in mice. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for NA structural analysis. The I427T substitution, which was responsible for the resistance phenotype observed in the double (1427T/Q313R) mutant, induced 17-, 56-, 7-, and 14-fold increases in IC50 values against oselta-mivir, zanamivir, peramivir and laninamivir, respectively. The I427T substitution alone or combined to Q313R significantly reduced NA affinity. The 1427T/Q313R and to a lesser extent I427T recombinant viruses displayed reduced viral titers vs WT in vitro. In experimentally-infected mice, the mortality rates were 62.5%, 0% and 14.3% for the WT, 1417T/Q313R and I427T viruses, respectively. There were about 2.5 and 2-Log reductions in mean lung viral titers on day 5 post-infection for the 1427T/Q313R and I427T mutants, respectively, compared to WT. Results from simulations revealed that the I427T change indirectly altered the stability of the catalytic R368 residue of the NA enzyme causing its reduced binding to the substrate/inhibitor. This study demonstrates that the 1427T/Q313R mutant, not only alters NAI susceptibility but also compromises NA properties and viral fitness, which could explain its infrequent detection in clinic.

Dependent upon the site of inoculation and strain of virus, experimental infection of neonatal mice with reoviruses can induce fatal encephalitis or myocarditis. Reovirus-induced apoptosis is a major mechanism of tissue injury, leading to disease development in both the brain and heart. In cultured cells, differences in the capacity of reovirus strains to induce apoptosis are determined by the S1 gene segment, which also plays a major role as a determinant of viral pathogenesis in both the heart and the central nervous system (CNS) in vivo. The S1 gene is bicistronic, encoding both the viral attachment protein sigma-1 and the nonstructural protein sigma-1-small (sigma1s). Although sigma1s is dispensable for viral replication in vitro, we wished to investigate the expression of sigma1s in the infected heart and brain and its potential role in reovirus pathogenesis in vivo. Two-day-old mice were inoculated intramuscularly or intracerebrally with either sigma1s(-) or sigma1s(+) reovirus strains. While viral replication in target organs did not differ between sigma1s(-) and sigma1s(+) viral strains, virus-induced caspase-3 activation and resultant histological tissue injury in both the heart and brain were significantly reduced in sigma1s(-) reovirus-infected animals. These results demonstrate that sigma1s is a determinant of the magnitude and extent of reovirus-induced apoptosis in both the heart and CNS and thereby contributes to reovirus pathogenesis and virulence.

The commitment of infected neurons toward the viral lytic or latent transcriptional program is likely to depend on both viral and cellular factors, and to differ among individual neurons. In this study, we used a mouse model of HSV-1 infection to investigate the relationship between viral genomes and the nuclear environment in terms of the establishment of latency. During acute infection, viral genomes show two major patterns: replication compartments or multiple spots distributed in the nucleoplasm (namely multiple-acute). Viral genomes in the multiple-acute pattern are systematically associated with the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in structures designated viral DNA-containing PML nuclear bodies (vDCP-NBs). To investigate the viral and cellular features that favor the acquisition of the latency-associated viral genome patterns, we infected mouse primary TG neurons from wild type (wt) mice or knock-out mice for type 1 interferon (IFN) receptor with wt or a mutant HSV-1, which is unable to replicate due to the synthesis of a non-functional ICP4, the major virus transactivator. We found that the inability of the virus to initiate the lytic program combined to its inability to synthesize a functional ICP0, are the two viral features leading to the formation of vDCP-NBs. The formation of the multiple-latency pattern is favored by the type 1 IFN signaling pathway in the context of neurons infected by a virus able to replicate through the expression of a functional ICP4 but unable to express functional VP16 and ICP0. Analyses of TGs harvested from HSV-1 latently infected humans showed that viral genomes and PML occupy similar nuclear areas in infected neurons, eventually forming vDCP-NB-like structures. Overall our study designates PML protein and PML-NBs to be major cellular components involved in the control of HSV-1 latency, probably during the entire life of an individual.

Blood				100	11 			449	Abstract No. 449						November 16, 2002	2002	In order to study T-cell lineage commitment, we have generated a mouse strain in which T cells cannot "switch off" CD4. This was achieved by deleting the silencer element in the first intron of the CD4 gene by a combination of homologous recombination and Cre-lox-mediated recombination in embryonic stem cells. The resultant mouse strain developed double positive mature T cells in the periphery. Functional assays revealed that some of these double positive cells were MHC class I-restricted while others were MHC class II-restricted and exhibited cytotoxic T cell (CTL) activity. In order to investigate the relative roles of MHC class I and class II cytotoxicity in anti-viral responses, we have bred these mice to mice deficient in MHC class I expression (beta-2 microglobulin deficient). These mice therefore had CTLs that were exclusively MHC class II-restricted. We infected wild-type mice (bearing class I-restricted CTLs), CD4-silencer-deficient mice (bearing class I- and II-restricted CTLs), CD4-silencer-deficient x beta-2 microglobulin-deficient mice (bearing class II-restricted CTLs) and beta-2 microglobulin-deficient mice (bearing no CTLs) with the non-cytopathic, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) intravenously. beta-2 microglobulin-deficient mice and CD4-silencer-deficient x beta-2 microglobulin deficient were unable to clear the virus. Intracranial injection of LCMV caused immune-mediated neuropathology in wild-type mice and CD4-silencer-deficient mice but not in the double (CD4-silencer x beta-2 microglobulin) deficient or beta-2 microglobulin-deficient mice. This result shows that class I restricted CTLs are necessary for clearance of LCMV after intravenous injection of LCMV, and immune-mediated neuro-pathology after intracranial injection of LCMV. Therefore, for this non-cytopathic virus, viral epitopes are presented to CTLs only in the context of MHC class I.					44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology44th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology	December 06-10, 2002December 06-10, 2002	American Society of HematologyAmerican Society of Hematology	Philadelphia, PA, USAPhiladelphia, PA, USA													BCI:BCI200300356527

The viral variant responsible of this outbreak has been found to share 99.7% identity over the entire genome with the viral variant that caused the epizootic in Israel in 1998 and has been referred as "Isr98/NY99". It has been shown to exhibit an increased neurovirulence in humans, as well as in experimental infections in different animal models. Mouse model has allowed to demonstrate the preferential infection of neurons within the central nervous system and to point out the genetic determinism of host susceptibility to WNV. In murine neural cell cultures, the selective infection of neurons was accompanied by physiopathological changes and a cytopathic effect, showing the direct effect of infection of neurons as one of the causes of WNV neuro pathogenicity.

Despite various mutations that have emerged over time through multiple human-to-human transmission chains, their biological relevance remains questionable. Recently, mutations in the glycoprotein GP and polymerase L, which emerged and stabilized early during the outbreak, have been associated with improved viral fitness in cell culture. Here, we infected mice and rhesus macaques with EBOV-Makona isolates carrying or lacking those mutations. Surprisingly, all isolates behaved very similarly independent of the genotype, causing severe or lethal disease in mice and macaques, respectively. Likewise, we could not detect any evidence for differences in virus shedding. Thus, no specific biological phenotype could be associated with these EBOV-Makona mutations in two animal models.																					WOS:000433292800018	29742435

Intranasal administration of RSV antigen-expressing MCMV elicits robust tissue-resident effector and effector memory CD8+T cells in the lung								MUCOSAL IMMUNOLOGY				10	2			545	554		10.1038/mi.2016.48				MAR 2017	2017	Cytomegalovirus vectors are promising delivery vehicles for vaccine strategies that aim to elicit effector CD8+ T cells. To determinehowthe route of immunization affects CD8+ T-cell responses in the lungs of mice vaccinated with a murine cytomegalovirus vector expressing the respiratory syncytial virus matrix (M) protein, we infected CB6F1 mice via the intranasal or intraperitoneal route and evaluated the M-specific CD8+ T-cell response at early and late time points. We found that intranasal vaccination generated robust and durable tissue-resident effector and effector memory CD8+ T-cell populations that were undetectable after intraperitoneal vaccination. The generation of these antigen-experienced cells by intranasal vaccination resulted in earlier T-cell responses, interferon gamma secretion, and viral clearance after respiratory syncytial virus challenge. Collectively, these findings validate a novel approach to vaccination that emphasizes the route of delivery as a key determinant of immune priming at the site of vulnerability.

To study the contribution of the intracellular viral sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA-5) in the host immune response to Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) we infected C57BL/6 and 129/SvJ mice lacking mda-5. Mice deficient in MDA-5 showed a dramatically increased susceptibility to CVB3 infection. The loss of MDA-5 allowed the virus to replicate faster, resulting in increased liver and pancreas damage and heightened mortality. MDA-5 was not absolutely required for the induction of type 1 interferons (IFNs), but essential for the production of maximal levels of systemic IFN-alpha early after infection. Taken together, our findings indicate that MDA-5 plays an important role in the host immune response to CVB3 by preventing early virus replication and limiting tissue pathology.

J	Fabian, K; Ivanics, R; Terenyi, M; Egyed, L								Detection of bovine herpesvirus 4 in CD11b+ leukocytes of experimentally infected rabbits								ACTA VETERINARIA HUNGARICA				53	2			265	273		10.1556/AVet.53.2005.2.12				2005	2005	The presence and numbers of bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) infected CD11b+ leukocytes were investigated during experimental infections of New Zealand White rabbits by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) analysis. Peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) were collected every second day, and the cells were stained with phycoerythrin-labelled CD11b-specific mouse monoclonal antibody and fluorescein-conjugated bovine herpesvirus 4-specific mouse monoclonal antibody. The numbers of double-stained cells from PBLs of the control and inoculated groups were measured and compared in FACS(TREK) analyser. Double-stained cells were detected in the virus-inoculated group on postinoculation days (PID) 2-5 and 9-12. The results indicated that CD11b+ PBLs were permissive for BoHV-4 infection, and are probably the main reservoir of the virus during the latent period. The data did not indicate production of infectious viral particles, but virus-specific proteins were expressed on the surface of CD11b+PBLs. The two waves of double-stained cells gave similar results to the PCR assays from serum samples, which showed the presence of viral DNA in the serum on the same days when virus-infected CD11b cells were also present. Productive BoHV-4 infection of mast cells or undifferentiated leukocytes in the bone marrow and the antiviral immune response might be responsible for this periodic appearance of the virus in CD11b+ PBLs and in the serum. The paper provides evidence that CD11b+ PBLs are the main target cell populations in the blood for BoHV-4.																					WOS:000229406800012	15959985

Six of seven epitopes, recognized by bank vole monoclonal antibodies, were localized within the amino-terminal region of the protein (aa 1-79). Polyclonal antibodies from wild-trapped or experimentally infected bank voles identified epitopes located over the entire protein. Antibody end-point titers to different N fragments indicated that the amino-terminal region is the major antigenic target in PUU virus-infected bank voles. To investigate the role of PUU virus N in protective immunity, we analyzed the immunogenicity of truncated recombinant N and developed an animal model based on colonized bank voles. No PUU virus N antigen, nor any glycoprotein-specific antibodies, could be detected after virus challenge in animals immunized with an amino-terminal fragment (aa 1-118), a fragment covering two thirds of the protein (aa 1-267), or total N, indicating that a complete protection was evoked by the recombinant proteins. Two of eight animals immunized with shorter N fragments displayed either N antigen, or glycoprotein-specific antibodies, suggestive of partial protection. Prechallenge sera from all groups of immunized animals were found negative or only weakly positive for neutralizing antibodies when assayed by focus reduction neutralization test, which indicated an important role for cell-mediated immunity in protection.

Inhibitory activities of bovine macromolecular whey proteins on rotavirus infections in vitro and in vivo								JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE				90	1			66	74		10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(07)72609-7				JAN 2007	2007	Rotavirus is a major cause of infantile viral gastroenteritis and can lead to severe and sometimes lethal dehydration. Previous studies have shown that breast-fed children are better protected against symptomatic infections, and that the milk fat globule protein lactadherin might be at least partly responsible for this effect. In vitro studies have shown that human lactadherin, in contrast to the bovine ortholog, could inhibit rotavirus infectivity, and that bovine MUC1 and a commercially available bovine macromolecular whey protein (MMWP) fraction proved to be effective. The present work describes the versatility of MMWP against the infection of 2 human intestinal cell lines (Caco-2 and FHs 74 Int) by 4 different rotavirus strains (Wa, RRV, YM, RF). Isolation of a protein fraction (CM3Q3) from MMWP that effectively inhibits rotavirus infectivity in vitro is documented. Purification was achieved by monitoring the rotaviral inhibitory activity in fractions obtained from 2 consecutive steps of ion-exchange chromatography. The major component of CM3Q3 was shown to be bovine IgG, and the attenuating capacity of this fraction is most properly linked to this component. The capacity of MMWP, MUC1, lactadherin, and the CM3Q3 fraction to inhibit the infectivity of the murine EMcN rotavirus strain was analyzed in adult BALB/c mice by using 2 different amounts of virus (10 and 100 times more than 50% the viral shedding doses). Only CM3Q3 was able to significantly affect the shedding of rotavirus in the stools of experimentally infected mice when the high viral dose was given. Detection of rotavirus-specific serum antibodies showed that the high dose infected all groups of mice. Experiments with the low dose of virus implied that all the tested milk proteins could affect the viral shedding in stools; in addition, use of MUC1, MMWP, and CM3Q3 prevented the appearance of serum viral antibodies. The advantages of using bovine immunoglobulins to induce passive immunity against rotavirus have been substantially investigated, although studies have mainly focused on the use of derivatives from immunized cows, especially colostrum. This report associates considerable activity against rotavirus infectivity with an ordinary whey product, suggesting that there might be alternatives to colostral-derived products.

Zika Virus Associated Pathology and Antigen Presence in the Testicle in the Absence of Sexual Transmission During Subacute to Chronic Infection in a Mouse Model								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				9						8325	10.1038/s41598-019-44582-9				JUN 6 2019	2019	Zika virus (ZIKV) is an arboviral infection that has been shown to be sexually transmitted. The study outlined herein aims to determine if accessory sex glands and epididymal epithelial cells are sources of viral persistence in subacute and chronic ZIKV infection, and if infection of these organs is important in sexual transmission during long-term (chronic) infection. Male interferon type I receptor knockout (Ifnar(-/-)) mice were challenged with ZIKV and reproductive tissues were harvested 14 and 35 days post infection (DPI) for inoculation studies and 14, 35 and 70 DPI for histopathology. Artificial insemination fluid derived from epididymal flush and seminal plasma from the prostate and seminal vesicle was obtained from ZIKV inoculated and sham-infected males. Naive interferon type I and II receptor knockout (AG129) female mice were pre-treated with progesterone and inoculated intravaginally with artificial insemination fluid from ZIKV-infected males. ZIKV RNA was detected in the artificial insemination fluid generated from epididymal flush or seminal plasma from ZIKV infected males at 14 and 35 DPI. ZIKV antigens were only detected in seminiferous tubules at 14 DPI. Epididymal epithelial cells did not show ZIKV antigen immunoreactivity at 14, 35 or 70 DPI. Severe fibrosing orchitis (end stage orchitis) was observed at 35 and 70 DPI. Mild inflammation and peri-tubular fibrosis were observed in the epididymis following clearance of virus. Viral RNA was not detected by PCR in whole blood samples of females from any intravaginal experimental group and only detected in 20% of subcutaneously inoculated animals (derived from 1 experimentally infected male) at 35 DPI. While ZIKV RNA and antigens can be detected in the male reproductive tract at 14 DPI and RNA can also be detected at 35 DPI, intravaginal inoculation of artificial insemination fluid from these time-points failed to result in viremia in naive females inoculated intravaginally. These studies support the hypothesis that epididymal epithelial cells are critical to sexual transmission in immunocompromised mice. Additionally, acute but not chronic male reproductive tract infection with ZIKV results in infectious virus capable of being sexually transmitted in mice.

Chinese Veterinary Science / Zhongguo Shouyi Kexue				41	9			928	932						2011	2011	A TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay was established for the detection of porcine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). The assay utilized a pair of specific primers and a TaqMan probe which was based on the conserved region of the 3D gene of EMCV. The established assay possessed a fine linear relationship between initial templates and Ct values, and the correlation coefficient of the standard curve was 0.998. The detection limit of the method was 10 copies/L of initial templates, which was 100-fold more sensitive than that of the conventional PCR. And the method was also highly specific with the fluorescent signals only be detected from EMCV, but not from foot-and-mouth disease virus, classical swine fever virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine pseudorabies virus, porcine parvovirus and normal BHK-21 cells. Moreover, the method was highly reproducible and had a coefficient of variation less than 1.5% for both intra- and inter-assays. The established assay was successfully applied for the detection of viral loads in the brain, heart and spleen tissues from mice which were experimentally infected with porcine EMCV GXLC strain, and for the detection of viral nucleic acids in 153 clinical samples collected from suspected EMCV-infection piglets. The high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of the assay indicated that the TaqMan real-time RT-PCR assay could be used as an effective tool for the detection and quantification of EMCV.

Rabies Virus Is Recognized by the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Activates Interleukin-1 beta Release in Murine Dendritic Cells								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				87	10			5848	5857		10.1128/JVI.00203-13				MAY 2013	2013	Inflammasome activation is important for the development of an effective host defense against many pathogens, including RNA viruses. However, the mechanism by which the inflammasome recognizes RNA viruses and its role in rabies virus (RABV) pathogenicity and immunogenicity remain poorly defined. To determine the function of the inflammasome in response to RABV infection, we infected murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with RABV. Our results indicate that the infection of BMDCs with RABV induces both the production of pro-interleukin-1 beta (pro-IL-1 beta) and its processing, resulting in the secretion of active IL-1 beta through activation of the NLRP3-, ASC-, and caspase-1-dependent inflammasome. As previously shown for the induction of type I interferon by RABV, the induction of pro-IL-1 beta also depends upon IPS-1. We demonstrate that both the production of pro-IL-1 beta and activation of the inflammasome require viral replication. We also demonstrate that increased viral replication in BMDCs derived from IFNAR-deficient mice resulted in significantly more IL-1 beta release. Additionally, IL-1 receptor-deficient mice show an increase in RABV pathogenicity. Taken together, these results indicate an important role of the inflammasome in innate immune recognition of RABV.																					WOS:000318155000046	23487464

In this way, we believe we will help our professional public to take a more comprehensive view of the currently uncertain epizootiological (epidemiological) situation regarding infections with influenza-A viruses in the world, and to secure preventive measures with due attention.New information is daily added to this matter, which is of wide-ranging aspects, and, because of insufficient space, we have limited this work to the aspects which are currently biologically the most significant.Consequently, we have divided the entire presentation into the following sections:Introduction with emphasis on the existence of large numbers of influenza-A viruses in nature, with a wide range of antigenic and biological characteristics in domestic and wild animals and birds, as well as on the fact that these viruses can be a potential source of so-called new pandemic viruses and pose a constant threat to human welfare.Results of comparative analyses of the influnza-A virus, with special emphasis on classification, virion structure, genome structure and nomenclature, on the progressive mutation of the virus, known as antigenic drift, and the genetic recombination, known as antigenic shift.Influenza-A viruses in humans, animals and birds with a presentation of subtypes and variants of the virus identified so far.Transfer of the virus among animals, birds and humans, with a presentation of cases registered so far of virus transfer in nature, as well as possibilities for experimental infections of calves, swine, mice, hamsters, and squirrels with influenza-A viruses originating from birds.Concluding remarks indicate the need for veterinary medicine to be more intensely engaged on investigations of the biology, genetics and epizootiology of isolated viruses in animal and birds, and thus to contribute to the clarification of numerous unknown factors that render influenza epidemiology in humans so exceptional.References show a part of the literature used in preparing this presentation.

Autoimmune arthritis caused by passive transfer of auto-antibodies against glucose phosphate isomerase (GPI) is transient and therefore lends itself well to test for what might extend the disease. Herpes viruses have long been suspected to contribute to human autoimmune disease, EBV in particular, in rheumatoid arthritis. We infected mice with a related murine &gamma;-herpesvirus (MHV-68). In immunodeficient mice, transient arthritis (induced by serum transfer with serum from KxN mice) was followed by a relapse, if the mice were infected with MHV-68. The relapse was due to lytic viral infection of synovial tissues demonstrated by PCR, immuno-histochemistry and electron microscopy. Clinical relapse of arthritis could be inhibited with an anti-viral drug. Latent infection could be reactivated in the synovium, when normal previously infected mice were treated with Cytoxan and this was associated with increased arthritis. We conclude that herpes viruses may play a pathogenic role in maintenance of chronic autoimmune arthritis. Our data suggest a novel mechanism by which a microbe can aggravate autoimmunity: direct infection of the autoimmune target tissue.Supported by a grant from the Arthritis Foundation.

Acta Parasitologica et Medica Entomologica Sinica				10	1			25	29						2003	2003	A study was conducted to determine whether sialokinin (the major vasodilator in the saliva of Aedes aegypti) enhances dengue 2 virus infection in experimentally infected BALB/c mice. Results revealed that mice administered with sialokinin had longer viraemia periods (4 vs. 1-2 days) and less antibody titres (1:64 and 1:96 vs. 1:16 and 1:32 in the 4th and 7th days, respectively) than mice not administered with sialokinin. The infection rates of macrophages varied in the first 7 days in mice administered with sialokinin. It is concluded that sialokinin enhances dengue 2 virus infection.

However, the mechanisms of TNF that influence the adaptive immune response to viral infections are poorly understood. Over recent years, there has been evidence to suggest a role for TNF in the early phase of infection of ruminants with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV). In this study, we infected TNF-/- mice with a plasmid encoding infectious BLV to further elucidate the role of TNF in BLV infection. TaqMan quantitative PCR showed that proviral DNA was present in genomic DNA isolated from spleen cells of TNF-/- mice 4 weeks post-infection, whereas it was not detected in wild-type mice. We were not able to detect differences in serum IgM or IgG levels between the TNF-/- and wild-type mice, or antibodies to BLV after this short period. In showing that the lack of TNF enables the plasmid encoded BLV to persist longer, and therefore rendering the mice more susceptible to an infection with BLV, the data suggest an important defence function of TNF in the early phase of BLV infection.

Despite the annual high morbidity and mortality caused by LASF, very little is known about the pathophysiology of the disease. Basic research on LASF has been precluded due to the lack of relevant small animal models that reproduce the human disease. Immunocompetent laboratory mice are resistant to infection with Lassa virus (LASV) and, to date, only immunodeficient mice, or mice expressing human HLA, have shown some degree of susceptibility to experimental infection. Here, transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells into irradiated type I interferon receptor knockout mice (IFNAR-/-) was used to generate chimeric mice that reproduced important features of severe LASF in humans. This included high lethality, liver damage, vascular leakage and systemic virus dissemination. In addition, this model indicated that T cell-mediated immunopathology was an important component of LASF pathogenesis that was directly correlated with vascular leakage. Our strategy allows easy generation of a suitable small animal model to test new vaccines and antivirals and to dissect the basic components of LASF pathophysiology.

The EBV oncoproteins nuclear antigen 3A (EBNA3A) and 3C (EBNA3C) are required for B cell transformation in vitro and are expressed in EBV associated immunoblastic lymphomas in vivo. In order to address the necessity of EBNA3A and EBNA3C for persistent EBV infection in vivo, we infected NOD-scid gamma(null)(c) mice with reconstituted human immune system components (huNSG mice) with recombinant EBV mutants devoid of EBNA3A or EBNA3C expression. These EBV mutants established latent infection in secondary lymphoid organs of infected huNSG mice for at least 3 months, but did not cause tumor formation. Low level viral persistence in the absence of EBNA3A or EBNA3C seemed to be supported primarily by proliferation with the expression of early latent EBV gene products transitioning into absent viral protein expression without elevated lytic replication. In vitro, EBNA3A and EBNA3C deficient EBV infected B cells could be rescued from apoptosis through CD40 stimulation, mimicking T cell help in secondary lymphoid tissues. Thus, even in the absence of the oncogenes EBNA3A and 3C, EBV can access a latent gene expression pattern that is reminiscent of EBV persistence in healthy virus carriers without prior expression of its whole growth transforming program.

In natural avian hosts, animal models and sporadic human outbreaks, H5N1 infection has been associated with neurological disease. We infected BALB/c mice intranasally with H5N1 influenza A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 to study the immune response during acute encephalitis. Using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, we compared the time course of viral infection with activation of immunity. By 5 days postinfection (DPI), mice had lost substantial body weight and required sacrifice by 7 DPI. H5N1 influenza was detected in the lung as early as 1 DPI, whereas infected neurons were not observed until 4 DPI. H5N1 infection of BALB/c mice developed into severe acute panencephalitis. Infected neurons lacked evidence of a perineuronal net and exhibited signs of apoptosis. Whereas lung influenza infection was associated with an early type I interferon (IFN) response followed by a reduction in viral burden concordant with appearance of IFN-?, the central nervous system environment exhibited a blunted type I IFN response.

Using an in vivo approach, the objectives of this study were to assess the risk of MVM transmission during rederivation and to provide data that allow recommendation of preventive measures. Therefore, we determined whether immunosuppressive variant MVMi viral DNA is detectable in reproductive organs, gametes (oocytes and spermatozoa), and embryos collected from experimentally infected mice and whether washing as recommended before ET eliminates MVMi sufficiently from gametes and embryos. Fractions of reproductive organs tested positive from Day 5 to Day 30 postinoculation, demonstrating a risk for a minimum period of 4 wk; the highest incidence of positive organs was found between Day 9 and Day 13 postinoculation. Real-time PCR detected viral DNA to a lesser extent in male than in female reproductive organs. MVMi DNA was detected in oocytes and sperm cells derived after in vivo infection but not in two-cell embryos. in vitro contamination studies revealed that the virus firmly adheres to the zona pellucida after 10 wash steps, indicating that even extensive washing might not eliminate MVMi completely from embryos. According to this systematic in vivo approach, recommended measures to prevent transmission of MVM during rederivation include sufficient washing of embryos, accompanying testing using adequate (PCR) methods, and using embryos rather than in vitro fertilization techniques; furthermore, the exchange of gametes should be considered a risk factor.

Previous studies have determined that CD8(+) T lymphocytes are required to restrict acute, productive MCMV infection within the central nervous system (CNS). In this study, we investigated the contribution of humoral immune responses in control of MCMV brain infection.Methodology/Principal Findings: Utilizing our MCMV brain infection model, we investigated B-lymphocyte-lineage cells and assessed their role in controlling the recovery of reactivated virus from latently infected brain tissue. Brain infiltrating leukocytes were first phenotyped using markers indicative of B-lymphocytes and plasma cells. Results obtained during these studies showed a steady increase in the recruitment of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells into the brain throughout the time-course of viral infection. Further, MCMV-specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) were detected within the infiltrating leukocyte population using an ELISPOT assay. Immunohistochemical studies of brain sections revealed co-localization of CD138(+) cells with either IgG or IgM. Additional immunohistochemical staining for MCMV early antigen 1 (E1, m112-113), a reported marker of viral latency in neurons, confirmed its expression in the brain during latent infection. Finally, using B-cell deficient (Jh(-/-)) mice we demonstrated that B-lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus from latently-infected brain tissue. A significantly higher rate of reactivated virus was recovered from the brains of Jh(-/-) mice when compared to Wt animals.Conclusion: Taken together, these results demonstrate that MCMV infection triggers accumulation and persistence of B-lymphocyte-lineage cells within the brain, which produce antibodies and play a significant role in controlling reactivated virus.

J	CHO K-S								EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES ON SWINE JAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS IN SOUTH KOREA 2. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PREVALENT VIRUS STRAINS AND THEIR EPIZOOTIC PATTERNS								Bulletin of Azabu University Veterinary Medicine				1	2			257	270						1980	1980	Newly isolated Japanese encephalitis (JE) viral strains were investigated by biological, physicochemical and serological tests, and by the experimental infection tests in mice and piglets. Relationships between viral characteristics and epizootic patterns were discussed. The Sosa (ASF-M1) strain, isolated from a mild epizootic case in 1969, was characterized by inferior multiplicity in various animal cells, especially in swine kidney and chick embryo cells, and lower agglutinating activity of the viral AE antigen to equine and rabbit erythrocytes or lower complement fixation antigenicity than the activities of the Anyang (ASF-M) strain of JE virus. In a mouse pathogenicity test of prevalent JE-viral strains, the Sosa (ASF-M1) strain showed a tendency toward lower peripheral infectivity than the Anyang (ASF-M) strain. Piglet infectivity of the Sosa (ASF-M1) strain was also significantly worse than the Anyang (ASF-M) strain; piglets following s.c. inoculation showed a short term viremia with scanty viral titer, without any clinical signs, and survived with a slight antibody response which rapidly decreased and disappeared within about a month after inoculation. The Anyang (ASF-M) strain induced clinical syndromes such as fever and appetite loss in the experimental piglets, with strong viremia (102 Mouse LD50/ml in virus titer) during 4 or 5 days. Swine infections were assumed to have been caused by naturally attenuated strains of JE virus, such as the Sosa (ASF-M1) strain in the field under timely or geographical opportunities. During the incidence of JE virus infection in pigs in 1969, the scanty swine antibody response was considered, and it was closely related with a lower potency of the pathogenicity or infectivity of JE virus, according to experimental piglet infections.

Using this procedure, low avidity antibodies were predominantly detected in experimentally infected deer mice (89.5%) within the first 30 days post-inoculation. The assay was then applied to sera from naturally infected deer mice collected during a field investigation associated with a cluster of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases. A higher proportion of seropositive mice collected during the outbreak had serum with low avidity antibodies (16.7%) when compared with mice trapped four months later (5.7%). Sin Nombre virus RNA was detectable in blood in a similar fraction of low- (45%) and high- (38.7%) avidity groups. Non-adult mice were more likely to contain low-avidity antibodies (44.4%n) than were adults (9.6%). Our results indicate that the IgG avidity assay shows promise as a tool to better characterize epizootic intensity and to identify factors involved in SNV transmission.

Journal of the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science				47	3			31	36						2008	2008	According to serologic surveys, murine norovirus (MNV) is the most prevalent viral pathogen infecting mice used in biomedical research. However, the use of sentinel mice to detect MNV-infected mouse populations has not been evaluated thoroughly. To this end, an experimental method of soiled bedding transfer was created to mimic a quarterly sentinel monitoring program. Soiled bedding (15 or 30 cm3) from ICR mice experimentally infected with MNV4 was transferred weekly to cages of pair-housed 4-wk-old ICR mice. After 12 wk, both mice in 80% (4 of 5) of cages receiving either 15 or 30 cm3 of soiled bedding were seropositive for MNV and were shedding virus in feces. To evaluate the stability of MNV RNA in mouse feces, fecal pellets from MNV-infected sentinel mice were stored at room temperature for as long as 14 d. After storage, all fecal samples tested positive for MNV by RT-PCR. To determine whether fecal samples could be pooled for MNV detection, 1 MNV-positive fecal pellet was combined with either 9 or 19 MNV-negative fecal pellets. All pooled fecal samples were positive for MNV by RT-PCR at both dilutions. These data indicate that although MNV-infected mouse populations can be detected by exposing sentinel mice to MNV-contaminated bedding, detection failures can occur. In addition, there was high agreement in the MNV infection status of cohoused sentinel mice. These data also demonstrate that MNV is readily detectable in pooled fecal samples and in mouse feces stored at room temperature for 2 wk.																					CABI:20093300960

A Human Gain-of-Function STING Mutation Causes Immunodeficiency and Gammaherpesvirus-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis in Mice								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				93	4					e01806-18	10.1128/JVI.01806-18				FEB 2019	2019	We previously generated STING N153S knock-in mice that have a human disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in STING. Patients with this mutation (STING N154S in humans) develop STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), a severe pediatric autoinflammatory disease characterized by pulmonary fibrosis. Since this mutation promotes the upregulation of antiviral type I interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), we hypothesized that STING N153S knock-in mice may develop more severe autoinflammatory disease in response to a virus challenge. To test this hypothesis, we infected heterozygous STING N153S mice with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (gamma HV68). STING N153S mice were highly vulnerable to infection and developed pulmonary fibrosis after infection. In addition to impairing CD8(+) T cell responses and humoral immunity, STING N153S also promoted the replication of gamma HV68 in cultured macrophages. In further support of a combined innate and adaptive immunodeficiency, gamma HV68 infection was more severe in Rag1(-/-) STING N153S mice than in Rag1(-/-) littermate mice, which completely lack adaptive immunity. Thus, a gain-of-function STING mutation creates a combined innate and adaptive immunodeficiency that leads to virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis.IMPORTANCE A variety of human rheumatologic disease-causing mutations have recently been identified. Some of these mutations are found in viral nucleic acidsensing proteins, but whether viruses can influence the onset or progression of these human diseases is less well understood. One such autoinflammatory disease, called STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), affects children and leads to severe lung disease. We generated mice with a SAVI-associated STING mutation and infected them with gamma HV68, a common DNA virus that is related to human Epstein-Barr virus. Mice with the human disease-causing STING mutation were more vulnerable to infection than wild-type littermate control animals. Furthermore, the STING mutant mice developed lung fibrosis similar to that of patients with SAVI. These findings reveal that a human STING mutation creates severe immunodeficiency, leading to virus-induced lung disease in mice.																					WOS:000457744600027	30463976

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri L26 Biocenol (TM) on the innate and adaptive immune responses in germ-free Balb/c mice, experimentally infected by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which confers immunosuppressive effect. A total of 30 six-week-old female mice were divided into 3 groups and animals in experimental group LPCV (n=10) were inoculated with L. reuteri L26, animals in the control group (C; n=10) and experimental group PCV (n=10) received sterile De Man-Rogosa-Sharpe broth for 7 days. Subsequently, mice from both experimental groups were infected with PCV2; however, mice in the control group received virus cultivation medium (mock). Virus load in faeces, ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN); as well as gene expression of selected cytokines, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and polymeric Ig receptor (PIgR) in the ileum, and percentage of CD8+, CD19+ and CD49b+ CD8-cells in the MLN were evaluated. Our results showed that L. reuteri significantly decreased the amount of PCV2 in faeces and in the ileum, and up-regulated the gene expression of chemokines, interferon (IFN)-gamma, IgA and PIgR in the ileum. Increased IFN-gamma mRNA level was accompanied by higher proportion of natural killer cells and up-regulated IgA and PIgR gene expressions were in accordance with significantly higher percentage of CD19+ lymphocytes in the MLN. These findings indicate that probiotic L. reuteri has an antiviral effect on PCV2 in the intestine which is mediated by stimulation of local gut immune response.

HeV repeatedly re-emerges in Australia while NiV continues to cause outbreaks in South Asia (Bangladesh and India), and these viruses have remained transboundary threats. In people and several mammalian species, HeV and NiV infections present as a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. NiV stands out as a potential pandemic threat because of its associated high case-fatality rates and capacity for human-to-human transmission. The development of effective vaccines, suitable for people and livestock, against HeV and NiV has been a research focus. Here, we review the progress made in NiV and HeV vaccine development, with an emphasis on those approaches that have been tested in established animal challengemodels of NiV and HeV infection and disease.

We infected mice intranasally at 8 days old (pups) and 6 weeks old (adults) to investigate differences in gamma HV-68 pathogenesis. There was no difference between adults or pups in acute infection in the lungs at 6 days post-infection (p.i.). However, mice infected as pups exhibited a more disseminated viral infection with viral DNA detected in the spleen, liver and heart as measured by quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). In addition, viral DNA was detected in the lungs of mice infected as pups until 60 days p.i. Three viral transcripts (M2, M3 and M9) were expressed at both 30 and 60 days p.i. In contrast, no viral DNA or mRNA expression was detected in lungs of mice infected as adults at 30 or 60 days p.i. Mice infected as adults experienced a peak in latent infection in the spleen at 16 days p.i., corresponding with an increase in splenic weight and expansion of the V beta 4(+) CD8(+) T-cell population, similar to infectious mononucleosis observed following infection of young adults with Epstein-Barr virus. However, the increase in splenic weight of infected pups was not as pronounced and no significant increase in V beta 4(+) CD8(+) T-cell expansion was observed in infected pups. Together, these data suggest that the pathogenesis of murine gammaherpesvirus gamma HV-68 is age-dependent.					32nd International Herpesvirus Workshop32nd International Herpesvirus Workshop	JUL 07-12, 2007JUL 07-12, 2007		Asheville, NCAsheville, NC													WOS:000255698900003	18420788

Peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PPMO) are nuclease resistant and water-soluble single-stranded-DNA-analogues that can enter cells readily and act as steric-blocking antisense agents through stable duplex formation with complementary RNA. Recently there have been a number of publications documenting sequence-specific and dose-dependent inhibition of non-retroviral RNA virus infections by PPMO in both cell culture and murine experimental systems. PPMO have suppressed viral titers by several orders of magnitude in cell cultures, and have reduced viral replication in and/or increased survivorship of mice experimentally infected with poliovirus, coxsackievirus B3, dengue virus, West Nile virus, Venezuelan Equine encephalitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Ebola virus and influenza A virus. Along with evaluating PPMO efficacy and toxicity, these studies also explored PPMO mechanism of action, pharmacologic properties and the generation and characterization of resistant virus. Effective PPMO target sites in viral RNA have included regions of highly conserved sequence thought to be important in the pre-initiation or initiation of translation, or in long-range RNA-RNA interactions involved in viral RNA synthesis. These studies provide guidance for the design of steric-blocking antisense agents against RNA viruses, insights into viral molecular biology and novel strategies for the development of antiviral therapeutics. The purpose of this review is to summarize notable findings from the reports documenting antiviral activity by PPMO, with a focus on the specific regions of viral RNA that provided the most effective targets for PPMO-based inhibition of viral replication.

Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Effectively Control Acute Chikungunya Virus Infection								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				10						3108	10.3389/fimmu.2019.03108				JAN 31 2020	2020	The Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus, in which its infection causes a febrile illness also commonly associated with severe joint pain and myalgia. Although the immune response to CHIKV has been studied, a better understanding of the virus-host interaction mechanisms may lead to more effective therapeutic interventions. In this context, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) have been described as a key mediator involved in the control of many pathogens, including several bacteria and viruses, but no reports of this important protective mechanism were documented during CHIKV infection. Here we demonstrate that the experimental infection of mouse-isolated neutrophils with CHIKV resulted in NETosis (NETs release) through a mechanism dependent on TLR7 activation and reactive oxygen species generation. In vitro, mouse-isolated neutrophils stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate release NETs that once incubated with CHIKV, resulting in further virus capture and neutralization. In vivo, NETs inhibition by the treatment of the mice with DNase resulted in the enhanced susceptibility of IFNAR(-/-) mice to CHIKV experimental acute infection. Lastly, by accessing the levels of MPO-DNA complex on the acutely CHIKV-infected patients, we found a correlation between the levels of NETs and the viral load in the blood, suggesting that NETs are also released in natural human infection cases. Altogether our findings characterize NETosis as a contributing natural process to control CHIKV acute infection, presenting an antiviral effect that helps to control systemic virus levels.

J	VanderLugt, JJ; Coetzer, JAW; Smit, MME								Distribution of viral antigen in tissues of new-born lambs infected with Rift Valley fever virus								ONDERSTEPOORT JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH				63	4			341	347						DEC 1996	1996	The distribution of Rift Valley fever (RVF) viral antigen was studied by immunohistochemistry in the liver, spleen, prescapular lymph node, lungs and kidneys of eight experimentally infected new-born lambs and in four new-born lambs that died of RVF during the 1974-75 RVF epidemic. The eight experimentally infected lambs were euthanazed at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 33, 48 and 51 h post-infection (p.i.), respectively. Immunohistochemical staining utilized polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascites fluid to RVF virus and peroxidase-diaminobenzidine as substrate.Virus antigen was most prominent in the liver and was detected as early as 18 h p.i. in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes that were sparsely scattered throughout the lobules. At 24-33 h p.i., antigen was also present in or adjacent to small fool of hepatocellular necrosis. At 48-51 h p.i. and in one of the field cases, positive staining was widespread and most consistently present in the cytoplasm of large numbers of degenerated or necrotic hepatocytes and in a few acidophilic bodies. Immunohistochemical staining was rarely observed in hepatocyte nuclei. Almost diffuse histochemical staining was observed in disintegrated cells and in the cytoplasm of necrotic hepatocytes throughout the liver in the other three field cases with pan necrosis;only the primary foci of necrosis and a narrow periportal rim of intact hepatocytes did not stain. No staining was observed in bile duct epithelium, endothelial and Kupffer cells in the initial stages of infection, supporting the contention that hepatocytes constitute the primary site of RVF virus replication in new-born lambs. Few cells stained positively in the spleen, prescapular lymph node, lungs and kidneys.																					WOS:A1996WK39300010	9173366

Invariant NKT Cells Regulate the CD8 T Cell Response during Theiler's Virus Infection								PLOS ONE				9	1					e87717	10.1371/journal.pone.0087717				JAN 30 2014	2014	Invariant NKT cells are innate lymphocytes with a broad tissue distribution. Here we demonstrate that iNKT cells reside in the central nervous system (CNS) in the absence of inflammation. Their presence in the CNS dramatically augments following inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice with the neurotropic Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV). At the peak of inflammation the cellular infiltrate comprises 45 000 iNKT cells for 1 250 CD8 T cells specific for the immunodominant TMEV epitope. To study the interaction between these two T cell subsets, we infected both iNKT cell deficient J alpha 18(-/-) mice and iNKT cell enriched V alpha 14 transgenic mice with TMEV. The CD8 T cell response readily cleared TMEV infection in the iNKT cell deficient mice. However, in the iNKT cell enriched mice TMEV infection persisted and was associated with significant mortality. This was caused by the inhibition of the CD8 T cell response in the cervical lymph nodes and spleen after T cell priming. Taken together we demonstrate that iNKT cells reside in the CNS in the absence of inflammation and that their enrichment is associated with the inhibition of the anti-viral CD8 T cell response and an augmented mortality during acute encephalomyelitis.

Rapid detection of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) antigen using fluorescein isothiocynate-conjugated immunoglobulins to replace identification by detection and to add antigen.								Alexandria Journal of Veterinary Sciences				51	2			52	57		10.5455/ajvs.219722				2016	2016	In the present study, attempts were made to prepare fluorescein-conjugated polyclonal antibodies to be used for accurate routine diagnosis of Newcastle Disease Virus. Ten male boskat rabbits, ten male guinea pigs and two male goats were subcutaneously hyperimmunized with NDV (Lasota strain). The mean HI antibody titers raised against NDV in rabbits, guinea pigs and goats were 8, 7 and 8.5 log2, respectively. The globulin contents of the prepared antisera were precipitated by ammonium sulphate and then conjugated with FITC. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the prepared conjugates in diagnostic purposes, direct FAT was applied for identification of NDV in impression smears prepared from various tissues of experimentally infected chickens using tenfold serial dilutions of the prepared conjugated antisera. Rabbits, guinea pig and goat conjugates showed clear positive reactions up to the dilution of 1/100000, 1/10000 and 1/1000000, respectively. The overall findings indicated that accurate and precise diagnosis of ND can be achieved by direct FAT using fluorescein-conjugated anti-NDV polyclonal antibodies. In conclusion goats are the preferable animal host for preparation of anti-ND hyper immune serum yielding the largest quantity of serum with the lowest effort and cost.

Primers were selected from ORF7, encoding nucleocapsid protein VP1. No specific amplification was observed with any other common murine virus or with RNAs from the closely related Lelystad virus and equine arteritis virus. In experimentally infected mice, LDV could be detected in plasma in both the acute and the persistent phases. LDV was also detected by the PCR in contaminated pools of Plasmodium berghei parasites which were maintained in mice, both by a direct analysis of the samples and by testing of plasma from mice inoculated with these pools. There was a complete agreement between the results of the PCR assay and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme assay of plasma from the inoculated mice. In contrast to the results of the LDH enzyme assay, no false-positive reactions were obtained in the PCR assay with negative control samples showing visible hemolysis. Storage of plasma samples at room temperature and at 4, -20, and -80 degrees C for up to 8 days did not influence the results of the PCR. These results show that the PCR is a valuable technique which may replace the LDH test as a diagnostic tool.																					WOS:A1994NX41400033	7989557

Different subpopulations of leukocytes enter the cardiac tissue and lead to severe cardiac inflammation associated with myocyte loss and remodeling. Here, we study possible cell sources for viral replication using three compartments of the heart: fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and macrophages. We infected C57BL/6j mice with Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and detected increased gene expression of anti-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines in the heart. Subsequently, we infected cardiac fibroblasts, cardiomyocytes, and macrophages with CVB3. Due to viral infection, the expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6, MCP-1, and IFN-beta was significantly increased in cardiac fibroblasts compared to cardiomyocytes or macrophages. We found that in addition to cardiomyocytes cardiac fibroblasts were infected by CVB3 and displayed a higher virus replication (132-fold increase) compared to cardiomyocytes (14-fold increase) between 6 and 24 hours after infection. At higher virus concentrations, macrophages are able to reduce the viral copy number. At low virus concentration a persistent virus infection was determined. Therefore, we suggest that cardiac fibroblasts play an important role in the pathology of CVB3-induced myocarditis and are another important contributor of virus replication aggravating myocarditis.

Infant mice were susceptible to infection with low doses of all three serotypes, whereas weanling mice were comparatively resistant to infection. Uniform transmission of virus to cagemates or mothers of infants did not occur, indicating low contagiousness of all three virus serotypes. The comparative susceptibility of 2-day-old Sencar mice to disease was examined following oronasal inoculation with reovirus 1, 2, or 3. Tissues were collected on days 3,5,7,9,14,16, and 21 after inoculation for virus isolation, histologic examination, and serologic analysis. Disease patterns in infant mice were distinctly different among reovirus serotypes. Reovirus 3 induced severe disease, with focal myocarditis, hepatitis, diffuse encephalitis, and generalized lymphoid depletion, whereas reovirus 1 induced a similar pattern, but much milder disease. In contrast, reovirus 2 induced mild transient enteritis without lesions in other organs. Sera from experimentally infected mice were tested in virus serotype-specific enzyme immunoassays. Cross reactivity of antibody among the three virus serotypes was found, but antibody titers were always highest with the homologous antigen. These studies confirm that infant laboratory mice are susceptible to infection with all three serotypes of virus; weanling mice are comparatively resistant to infection and disease; the viruses induce different patterns of disease in infant mice; and infecting virus serotypes can be distinguished serologically by enzyme immunoassay.

Systemic Expression of a Viral RdRP Protects against Retrovirus Infection and Disease								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				94	9					e00071-20	10.1128/JVI.00071-20				MAY 2020	2020	The innate immune system is normally programmed for immediate but transient upregulation in response to invading pathogens, and interferon (IFN)-stimulated gene (ISG) activation is a central feature. In contrast, chronic innate immune system activation is typically associated with autoimmunity and a broad array of autoinflammatory diseases that include the interferonopathies. Here, we studied retroviral susceptibility in a transgenic mouse model with lifelong innate immune system hyperactivation. The mice transgenically express low levels of a picornaviral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), which synthesizes double-stranded RNAs that are sensed by melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) to trigger constitutive upregulation of many ISGs. However, in striking counterpoint to the paradigm established by numerous human and murine examples of ISG hyperactivation, including constitutive MDA5 activation, they lack autoinflammatory sequelae. RdRP-transgenic mice (RdRP mice) resist infection and disease caused by several pathogenic RNA and DNA viruses. However, retroviruses are sensed through other mechanisms, persist in the host, and have distinctive replication and immunity-evading properties. We infected RdRP mice and wild-type (WT) mice with various doses of a pathogenic retrovirus (Friend virus) and assessed immune parameters and disease at 1, 4, and 8 weeks. Compared to WT mice, RdRP mice had significantly reduced splenomegaly, viral loads, and infection of multiple target cell types in the spleen and the bone marrow. During chronic infection, RdRP mice had 2.35 +/- 0.66 log(10) lower circulating viral RNA than WT. Protection required ongoing type I IFN signaling. The results show that the reconfigured RdRP mouse innate immune system substantially reduced retroviral replication, set point, and pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Immune control of retroviruses is notoriously difficult, a fundamental problem that has been most clinically consequential with the HIV-1 pandemic. As humans expand further into previously uninhabited areas, the likelihood of new zoonotic retroviral exposures increases. The role of the innate immune system, including ISGs, in controlling retroviral infections is currently an area of intensive study. This work provides evidence that a primed innate immune system is an effective defense against retroviral pathogenesis, resulting in reduced viral replication and burden of disease outcomes. RdRP mice also had considerably lower Friend retrovirus (FV) viremia. The results could have implications for harnessing ISG responses to reduce transmission or control pathogenesis of human retroviral pathogens.																					WOS:000527363300025	32051266

Mice were sacrificed on days 1, 3, 6, and 10 post infection or whenever morbidity was severe enough to justify euthanasia. Morbidity rates were calculated on the basis of clinical signs (weight loss, poor hair coat, hunched posture and paresis); virus-induced disease was characterised by the histopathology of lung; virus dissemination was determined by virus isolation on organ samples of lung, brain, liver, kidney and spleen. All mice infected with mouse-adapted A(H1N1) pdm09 died in the course of the experiment, whereas 20% of animals survived the infection with A(H5N1). Echinocyte formation changed the rheological properties of blood in animals infected with either mouse-adapted A(H1N1) pdm09 or A(H5N1). To sum up, the adaptation of pandemic A(H1N1) pdm09 virus can confer an enhanced virulence similar to or even exceeding that of HPAI A(H5N1) virus.																					WOS:000413761100007	28083862

R	Beckstette, Michael; Malgorzata, Ciurkiewicz; Stefan, Floess; Michael, Beckstette; Maren, Kummerfeld; Wolfgang, B; Jochen, Huehn; Andreas, Beineke								Transcriptome analysis of initial cerebral responses following neurotropic virus infection reveals faulty innate immunity and delayed antigen presentation in mice susceptible to virus-induced demyelination								Gene Expression Omnibus															2021-02-18	2020	Viral infections of the central nervous system cause acute or delayed neuropathology and clinical consequences ranging from asymptomatic courses to chronic, debilitating diseases. The outcome of viral encephalitis is partially determined by genetically programmed immune response patterns of the host. Experimental infection of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) causes diverse neurologic diseases, including TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD), depending on the used mouse strain. The aim of the present study was to compare initial transcriptomic changes occurring in the brain of TMEV-infected SJl (TMEV-IDD susceptible) and C57Bl/6 (TMEV-IDD resistant) mice. Animals were infected intracerebrally with TMEV and sacrificed 4, 7 or 14 days post infection (dpi). Control animals of both strains were inoculated with vehicle only and sacrificed at 7 dpi. RnA was isolated from brain tissue and analyzed by whole transcriptome sequencing. Selected differences were confirmed on a protein level by immunohistochemistry. In mock-infected mice SJl and C57Bl/6 mice, >200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected. Following TMEV-infection, the number of DEGs increased to >700. Infected C57Bl/6 mice showed a higher expression of transcripts related to antigen presentation MHCI I, innate antiviral immune responses and cytotoxicity, compared to infected SJl animals. Many of those genes were also upregulated in SJl mice upon infection, but the response was weaker or delayed, which could be responsible for failure of viral clearance in this mouse strain. SJl mice showed prolonged elevation of MHC II and chemotactic genes, compared to C57Bl/6 mice, which presumably facilitates the induction of chronic demyelinating disease. In addition, elevated expression of several genes associated with immunomodulatory or -suppressive functions was observed in SJl mice. The exploratory study confirms previous observations in the model and provides an extensive list of immunologic parameters potentially contributing to different outcomes of viral encephalitis in two mouse strains.

R			Microbiology & Immunology, Loyola University Chicago						Gene Expression Timecourse of WT, DUBmut, and EndoUmut Mouse Hepatitis Virus Strain A59 infected C57bl/6 Bone Marrow derived macrophages								European Nucleotide Archive															2020-04-01	2020	We report the differences in innate immune activation in the comparison of wild type and mutant Mouse Hepatitis Virus Strain A59 infection of bone marrow derived macrophages. We infected BMDMs and harvested RNA at 3, 6, 9, and 12 hpi while comparing changes in host gene expression compared to mock infected cells. Here, using a transcriptomics approach, we compared the scope and kinetics of the host response to the wild type, DUBmut, and EndoUmut viruses in infected macrophages. We found that the EndoUmut virus activates a focused response, predominantly involving type I interferons and a subset of interferon-responsive genes, within 12 hours after infection. In contrast, the wild type and DUBmut viruses stimulate the upregulation of over 2,800 genes, including the activation of unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways and a proinflammatory response associated with viral pathogenesis. This study highlights the role of viral interferon antagonists in modulating the kinetics and magnitude of the host response during virus infection and demonstrates that inactivation of a dominant viral antagonist, the coronavirus endoribonuclease, dramatically alters the host response in macrophages and the disease process. Overall design: Examination of 3 different Mouse Hepatitis Virus Strain A59 infecting C57bl6 BMDMs at 4 different timepoints. Each sample was done in triplicate with a mock infected control.																					DRCI:DATA2020069018476262

The virulence of these viruses is determined by their ability to replicate sequentially in striated muscle, cause viremia, and invade and replicate in the central nervous system. These viruses are also able to infect vector mosquitoes following ingestion of a blood meal containing virus. Bunyaviruses are negative stranded RNA viruses with a trisegmented genome, and the large, medium, and small RNA segments encode the polymerase, the glycoproteins, and the nucleoprotein, respectively. Reassortants between virulent and avirulent virus clones have been used to map virulence determinants in mice as well as determinants of infectivity in mosquitoes. Attenuation in mice and infectivity in mosquitoes of some virus clones maps to the medium RNA segment, implying that the virus glycoproteins, which are involved in virus entry, play a role in virulence. Attenuation in mice and mosquito infectivity of other clones maps to the large RNA segment, suggesting that cell-specific differences in the function of the viral polymerase can also determine virulence and host range.

Characterization of lethal dengue virus type 4 (DENV-4) TVP-376 infection in mice lacking both IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma receptors (AG129) and comparison with the DENV-2 AG129 mouse model								JOURNAL OF GENERAL VIROLOGY				96				3035	3048		10.1099/jgv.0.000246				SEP 2015	2015	Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease caused by four related but distinct dengue viruses, DENV-1 to DENV-4. Dengue is endemic in most tropical countries, and over a third of the world's population is at risk of being infected. Although the global burden is high, no vaccine or antiviral is licensed to combat this disease. An obstacle complicating dengue research is the lack of animal challenge models that mimic human disease. Advances in immunocompromised murine infection models resulted in development of lethal DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 models in AG129 mice, which are deficient in both the IFN-alpha/beta receptor (IFN-alpha/beta R) and the IFN-gamma receptor (IFN-gamma R). These models mimic features of dengue disease in humans. Here, we characterized lethal infection of AG129 mice by DENV-4 strain TVP-376 and found that AG129 mice developed clinical signs of illness and high viral loads in multiple tissues and succumbed 5 days after infection. Moreover, the splenic and hepatic histopathology of TVP-376-infected mice demonstrated the presence of cell activation and destruction of tissue architecture. Furthermore, infected mice had heightened levels of circulating cytokines. Comparison of the virulence phenotypes of DENV-4 strain TVP-376 and DENV-2 strain D2S10 revealed that TVP-376-induced mortality occurred in the absence of both IFN-alpha/beta R and IFN-gamma R signalling, but not with intact signalling from the IFN-gamma R, whereas D2S10 required the absence of IFN-alpha/beta R signalling only, indicating that it is more virulent than TVP-376. In conclusion, TVP-376 is lethal in AG129 mice, and this model provides a useful platform to investigate vaccine candidates and antivirals against DENV-4.

In order to investigate possible contamination of products including those manufactured and/or licensed in the US, 38 lots of viral vaccines and five lots of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) were tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV). All vaccines and interferons were negative for contaminating BVDV RNA when tested by RT-PCR, with the exception of an experimental live viral vaccine that had been produced in BVDV contaminated rabbit kidney cells. Cell lines commonly used to produce biological products and vaccines were experimentally infected with the NADL strain of BVDV to determine ii they were permissive for virus replication. MRC-5 and WI-38 cells were not infected. In contrast, Vero, CHO and CEF cells showed evidence of pestivirus infection. Taken together these data suggested that currently licensed viral vaccines were unlikely to be contaminated with pestiviruses. However, cell banks derived from non-human primate, hamster or rabbit kidney cell lines, or cultures of primary chick embryo fibroblasts, may be infected with BVDV if exposed to pestivirus contaminated raw materials during manufacture.

Sixty days after oral inoculation, MNV was isolated from the cecum (3/3 scid and 3/3 ICR), feces (3/3 scid and 3/3 ICR), duodenum (1/3 scid and 3/3 ICR), liver (1/3 scid and 1/3 ICR), and spleen (3/3 ICR) samples, but MNV was not detected in the brain, heart, kidney, lung, salivary gland, ovary, thymus, or uterus samples of any of the orally inoculated mice. Feces of males cohabiting with MNV infected dams were positive for viral RNA after 18 days of cohabitation, but 8 fetuses (embryonic day 18.0) derived from the dams were negative for the virus. The results suggest that the cecum and feces are the most suitable sample types for the detection of MNV in infected animals and that caesarean section is efficient for the elimination of the virus. In terms of spontaneous infection, the RNA polymerase gene of MNV was isolated from 33/245 (13.1%) cecum samples derived from 15/59 (25.4%) facilities, and the sequence analysis revealed that at least 5 types of the virus were prevalent. This is the first report on MNV infection in mouse colonies in Japan.																					WOS:000265438400008	19448336

Comparative pathology of North American and central African strains of monkeypox virus in a ground squirrel model of the disease								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE				76	1			155	164		10.4269/ajtmh.2007.76.155				JAN 2007	2007	The first human cases of monkeypox (MPX) were recognized in central Africa in 1970. Since then, sporadic outbreaks of the disease have occurred in central and west Africa. In 2003, an outbreak of human MPX occurred in the United States after importation of infected rodents from west Africa. Clinical features of the 2003 outbreak were less severe than accounts of the disease among people in central Africa. The reasons for this observed difference are unknown. In this study, the clinical and pathologic characteristics of experimental infection with representative central African and North American MPX virus strains were compared in a ground squirrel model of the disease. The results indicate that the US 2003 virus, which phylogenetically is a member of the west African MPX virus clade, was less virulent than central African MPX virus strains.

Virologica Sinica											10.1016/j.virs.2022.03.007				2022-Mar-11	2022	Getah virus (GETV) is a mosquito-borne virus of the genus Alphavirus in the family Togaviridae and, in recent years, it has caused several outbreaks in animals. The molecular basis for GETV pathogenicity is not well understood. Therefore, a reverse genetic system of GETV is needed to produce genetically modified viruses for the study of the viral replication and its pathogenic mechanism. Here, we generated a CMV-driven infectious cDNA clone based on a previously isolated GETV strain, GX201808 (pGETV-GX). Transfection of pGETV-GX into BHK-21​cells resulted in the recovery of a recombinant virus (rGETV-GX) which showed similar growth characteristics to its parental virus. Then three-day-old mice were experimentally infected with either the parental or recombinant virus. The recombinant virus showed milder pathogenicity than the parental virus in the mice. Based on the established CMV-driven cDNA clone, subgenomic promoter and two restriction enzyme sites (BamHI and EcoRI) were introduced into the region between E1 protein and 3'UTR. Then the green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP) and improved light-oxygen-voltage (iLOV) genes were inserted into the restriction enzyme sites. Transfection of the constructs carrying the reporter genes into BHK-21​cells proved the rescue of the recombinant reporter viruses. Taken together, the establishment of a reverse genetic system for GETV provides a valuable tool for the study of the virus life cycle, and to aid the development of genetically engineered GETVs as vectors for foreign gene expression.

The 50% effective concentrations in these experiments ranged from 1.8 to 59.5 mu M, with no cytotoxicity evident at 1000 mu M, using inhibition of viral cytopathic effect determined visually and by neutral red dye uptake. The ethyl ester prodrug of GS4071, GS4104, administered by oral gavage (p.o.), had significant inhibitory effects on infections in mice induced by these viruses. Antiviral effects were seen as prevention of death, increase in mean day to death, inhibition of decline of arterial oxygen saturation, lessened lung consolidation and inhibition of infectious virus recovered from the lungs. No toxicity was seen in dosages up to 100 mg/kg/day (highest evaluated). Comparison experiments run versus the influenza A (H1N1) virus-induced infection using GS4104, GS4071 and the neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir (GG167, 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en), all administered p.o., indicated a 10-fold or greater potency for inhibiting the infection by GS4104. The minimum effective dosage for GS4104 was 0.1 mg/kg/day, with the compound administered twice daily for 5 days beginning 4 h pre-virus exposure. Oral therapy with GS4104 could be delayed from 48 to at least 60 h after exposure of mice to influenza A (H1N1) virus and still render a significant antiviral effect, the time of delay being dependent on the viral challenge dose. Intranasal instillation of GS4071 and GG167 to mice infected with influenza virus was highly inhibitory to the infection, the minimum effective dosages to significantly prevent death being 0.01 mg/kg/day for GS4071 and 0.1 mg/kg/day for GG167. Caging of infected mice treated with 10 mg/kg/day of GS4104 with infected saline-treated animals did not transfer any influenza-inhibitory effect to the latter animals. These data provide strong evidence of the potential of orally administered GS4104 for treatment of influenza A and B virus infections in humans. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Our results suggested that two selection mechanisms were operating: (i) the eggs selected specific sperm; and (ii) the second meiotic division in the eggs was influenced by the type of sperm that entered the egg. Furthermore, the proportion of MHC-heterozygous embryos varied over time, suggesting that non-random fertilization was dependent on an external factor that changed over time. As a higher frequency of heterozygous individuals correlated with an uncontrolled epidemic by MHV (mouse hepatitis virus), we suggested that MHV-infection might have influenced the outcome of fertilization. Here, we present an experiment that tests this hypothesis. We infected randomly chosen mice with MHV and sham-infected control mice five days before pairing. We recovered the two-cell embryos from the oviduct, cultured them until the blastocyst stage, and determined the genotype of each resulting blastocyst by polymerase chain reaction. We found the pattern that we expected from our previous experiments: virus-infected mice produced more MHC-heterozygous embryos than sham-infected ones. This suggests that parents are able to promote specific combinations of MHC-haplotypes during fertilization according to the presence or absence of a viral infection.

In this study, in vitro-propagated MNV-1 was used as antigen to develop a multiplexed fluorescent immunoassay (MFI) to detect antibodies to MNV-1 in infected mice. The MNV-1 MFI was 100% specific and 100% sensitive in detecting anti-MNV-1 antibody in sera from experimentally infected mice. Testing of a large number of mouse serum samples (n = 12,639) submitted from contemporary laboratory mouse colonies in the United States and Canada revealed that 22.1% of these sera contained antibodies to MNV-1, indicating infection with MNV-1 is widespread in research mice. In addition, a reverse transcriptase PCR primer pair with a sensitivity of 25 virus copies was developed and used to demonstrate that MNV-1 RNA could be detected in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and jejunum from some experimentally infected mice 5 weeks postinoculation. These diagnostic assays provide the necessary tools to define the MNV-1 infection status of research mice and to aid in the establishment of laboratory mouse colonies free of MNV-1 infection.

Tempol ameliorates murine viral encephalomyelitis by preserving the blood-brain barrier, reducing viral load, and lessening inflammation								FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE				48	5			704	712		10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2009.12.013				MAR 1 2010	2010	Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive inflammatory and/or demyelinating disease of the human central nervous system (CNS). Most of the knowledge about the pathogenesis of MS has been derived from murine models, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and vital encephalomyelitis. Here, we infected female C57BL/6 mice with a neurotropic strain of the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-59A) to evaluate whether treatment with the multifunctional antioxidant tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy) affects the ensuing encephalomyelitis. In untreated animals, neurological symptoms developed quickly: 90% of infected mice died 10 days after virus inoculation and the few survivors presented neurological deficits. Treatment with tempol (24 mg/kg, ip, two doses on the first day and daily doses for 7 days plus 2 mM tempol in the drinking water ad libitum) profoundly altered the disease outcome: neurological symptoms were attenuated, mouse survival increased up to 70%, and half of the survivors behaved as normal mice. Not Surprisingly, tempol substantially preserved the integrity of the CNS, including the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, treatment with tempol decreased CNS vital titers, macrophage and T lymphocyte infiltration, and levels of markers of inflammation, such as expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, transcription of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, and protein nitration. The results indicate that tempol ameliorates murine viral encephalomyelitis by altering the redox status of the infectious environment that contributes to an attenuated CNS inflammatory response. overall, our study supports the development of therapeutic strategies based on nitroxides to manage neuroinflammatory diseases, including MS.

Specific binding of antigen was detected by a rabbit anti-CCHF horseradish peroxidase conjugate or a sandwich technique with hyperimmune mouse anti-CCHF ascitic fluid and commercially available anti-mouse immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugate. The persistence of IgM antibody activity was found to be of shorter duration than in humans, and this may be a function of the relative lack of susceptibility of these animals to infection with CCHF virus. IgG antibody responses in the sheep could be monitored by sandwich ELISA using commercially available anti-sheep immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugates. Total antibody activity in the sera of experimentally infected sheep, cattle and small mammals could be monitored in a competitive ELISA (CELISA) using rabbit anti-CCHF peroxidase conjugate. The CELISA was applied to the sera of 960 wild vertebrates from a nature reserve in South Africa, and the prevalence of antibody was found to be greatest in large mammals such as rhinoceros, giraffe and buffalo, which are known to be the preferred hosts of the adult tick (Hyalomma) vectors of the virus.

J	Petit, Nicolas Y.; Lambert-Niclot, Sidonie; Marcelin, Anne-Genevieve; Garcia, Sylvie; Marodon, Gilles								HIV Replication Is Not Controlled by CD8(+) T Cells during the Acute Phase of the Infection in Humanized Mice								PLOS ONE				10	9					e0138420	10.1371/journal.pone.0138420				SEP 25 2015	2015	HIV replication follows a well-defined pattern during the acute phase of the infection in humans. After reaching a peak during the first few weeks after infection, viral replication resolves to a set-point thereafter. There are still uncertainties regarding the contribution of CD8(+) T cells in establishing this set-point. An alternative explanation, supported by in silico modeling, would imply that viral replication is limited by the number of available targets for infection, i.e. CD4(+) CCR5(+) T cells. Here, we used NOD. SCID. gc(-/-) mice bearing human CD4(+) CCR5(+) and CD8(+) T cells derived from CD34(+) progenitors to investigate the relative contribution of both in viral control after the peak. Using low dose of a CCR5-tropic HIV virus, we observed an increase in viral replication followed by "spontaneous" resolution of the peak, similar to humans. To rule out any possible role for CD8(+) T cells in viral control, we infected mice in which CD8(+) T cells had been removed by a depleting antibody. Globally, viral replication was not affected by the absence of CD8(+) T cells. Strikingly, resolution of the viral peak was equally observed in mice with or without CD8(+) T cells, showing that CD8(+) T cells were not involved in viral control in the early phase of the infection. In contrast, a marked and specific loss of CCR5-expressing CD4(+) T cells was observed in the spleen and in the bone marrow, but not in the blood, of infected animals. Our results strongly suggest that viral replication during the acute phase of the infection in humanized mice is mainly constrained by the number of available targets in lymphoid tissues rather than by CD8(+) T cells.

Recent studies suggest that IL-9 mediated both antimicrobial immune and autoimmune responses in addition to allergic diseases. However, the role of IL-9 in viral infection and VMC remains controversial and uncertain. In this study, we infected Balb/c mice with Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and found that IL-9 was enriched in the blood and hearts of VMC mice on days 5 and 7 after virus infection. Most of IL-9 was secreted by CD8(+) T cells on day 5 and CD4(+) T cells on day 7 in the myocardium. Further, IL-9 knockout exacerbated cardiac damage following CVB3 infection, along with a sharp increase in viral replication and IL-17a expression, as well as a decrease in TGF-beta. In contrast, the repletion of IL-9 in Balb/c mice with CVB infection induced the opposite effect. Studies in vitro further revealed that IL-9 directly inhibited viral replication in cardiomyocytes by reducing coxsackie and adenovirus receptor expression, which might be associated with upregulation of TGF-beta autocrine effect in these cells. However, IL-9 had no direct effect on apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Our data indicated that IL-9 played a protective role in disease progression by inhibiting CVB3 replication in the early stages of VMC.																					WOS:000384761100001	27766098

The sequence analysis of HA showed that the virus possessed a motif of 334PELMQGRGL343 at the cleavage site of HA protein which categorized the isolate as a low pathogenic AIV. In addition, the HA gene of the isolate shared the highest homologous (97.90%) to that of the AIV A/Duck/Hunan/S11205/2012(H10N3), but the identity of NA gene was the highest (97.46%) to the AIV A/Domestic Duck/Republic of Georgia/1/2010 (H10N7). While, the internal genes of the isolate were higher identity to H9N2 and the other subtype AIVs, respectively. The sequence alignment revealed that the isolate probably was a natural reassortant from different subtype AIVs. Pathogenic study displayed that the artificially infected mice did not show any clinical symptoms and weight gain loss. However, the virus could be only detected in lungs and turbinates of the infected mice. These data demonstrated that the virus was also low pathogenic to mice.																					CABI:20153076451

To determine the prevalence of HEV infection in animals, a serological assay with capability to detect anti-HEV-antibody across a wide variety of animal species was devised. Recombinant antigens comprising truncated capsid proteins generated from HEV-subgenomic constructs that represent all four viral genotypes were used to capture anti-HEV in the test sample and as an analyte reporter. To facilitate development and validation of the assay, serum samples were assembled from blood donors (n = 372), acute hepatitis E patients (n = 94), five laboratory animals (rhesus monkey, pig, New Zealand rabbit, Wistar rat, and BALB/c mouse) immunized with HEV antigens, and four pigs experimentally infected with HEV. The assay was then applied to 4,936 sera collected from 35 genera of animals that were wild, feral, domesticated, or otherwise held captive in the United States. Test positivity was determined in 457 samples (9.3%). These originated from: bison (3/65, 4.6%), cattle (174/1,156, 15%), dogs (2/212, 0.9%), Norway rats (2/318, 0.6%), farmed swine (267/648, 41.2%), and feral swine (9/306, 2.9%). Only the porcine samples yielded the highest reactivities. HEV RNA was amplified from one farmed pig and two feral pigs and characterized by nucleotide sequencing to belong to genotype 3. HEV infected farmed swine primarily, and the role of other animals as reservoirs of its zoonotic spread appears to be limited.																					WOS:000298113400024	21998412

Protective role of nuclear Factor erythroid 2-related Factor 2 against respiratory syncytial Virus and human Metapneumovirus infections								FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY				9						854	10.3389/fimmu.2018.00854				APR 23 2018	2018	The pathogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections is characterized by lower airway obstruction driven at great extent by the exuberant production of inflammatory cytokines. We have previously shown that RSV infection in vitro and in vivo results in production of reactive oxygen species along with reduction in the expression of antioxidant enzymes (AOEs), which are involved in maintaining the cellular oxidantantioxidant balance. These events were associated with the concomitant reduction in nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor that controls AOE expression. The objective of the current study was to establish the role of Nrf2 in shaping innate immune responses, clinical disease, airway inflammation, and viral replication in established experimental models of intranasal RSV and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infections, by employing mice genetically deficient for the Nrf2 gene. Compared to control wild type (WT), mice genetically deficient in Nrf2 (Nrf2 KO) developed enhanced clinical disease, airway inflammation and pathology, and significantly greater lung viral titers following experimental infection with either RSV or hMPV. In particular, compared to control mice, RSV-infected Nrf2 KO mice lost more body weight and had increased airway obstruction at time points characterized by a remarkable increase in inflammatory cytokines and airway neutrophilia. Airway levels of AOEs and enzymes that regulate synthesis of the endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H2S) pathway, which we showed to play an important antiviral function, were also decreased in RSV-infected Nrf2 KO compared to WT. In conclusion, these results suggest that Nrf2 is a critical regulator of innate, inflammatory, and disease-associated responses in the airways of mice infected with viruses that are members of the Pneumoviridae family. Importantly, the results of this study suggest that Nrf2-dependent genes, including those controlling the cellular antioxidant and H2S-generating enzymes and cytokines can affect several aspects of the antiviral response, such as airway neutrophilia, clinical disease, airway obstruction, and viral replication.

Murine Coronavirus Ubiquitin-Like Domain Is Important for Papain-Like Protease Stability and Viral Pathogenesis								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY				89	9			4907	4917		10.1128/JVI.00338-15				MAY 2015	2015	Ubiquitin-like domains (Ubls) now are recognized as common elements adjacent to viral and cellular proteases; however, their function is unclear. Structural studies of the papain-like protease (PLP) domains of coronaviruses (CoVs) revealed an adjacent Ubl domain in severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, and the murine CoV, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Here, we tested the effect of altering the Ubl adjacent to PLP2 of MHV on enzyme activity, viral replication, and pathogenesis. Using deletion and substitution approaches, we identified sites within the Ubl domain, residues 785 to 787 of nonstructural protein 3, which negatively affect protease activity, and valine residues 785 and 787, which negatively affect deubiquitinating activity. Using reverse genetics, we engineered Ubl mutant viruses and found that AM2 (V787S) and AM3 (V785S) viruses replicate efficiently at 37 degrees C but generate smaller plaques than wild-type (WT) virus, and AM2 is defective for replication at higher temperatures. To evaluate the effect of the mutation on protease activity, we purified WT and Ubl mutant PLP2 and found that the proteases exhibit similar specific activities at 25 degrees C. However, the thermal stability of the Ubl mutant PLP2 was significantly reduced at 30 degrees C, thereby reducing the total enzymatic activity. To determine if the destabilizing mutation affects viral pathogenesis, we infected C57BL/6 mice with WT or AM2 virus and found that the mutant virus is highly attenuated, yet it replicates sufficiently to elicit protective immunity. These studies revealed that modulating the Ubl domain adjacent to the PLP reduces protease stability and viral pathogenesis, revealing a novel approach to coronavirus attenuation.IMPORTANCEIntroducing mutations into a protein or virus can have either direct or indirect effects on function. We asked if changes in the Ubl domain, a conserved domain adjacent to the coronavirus papain-like protease, altered the viral protease activity or affected viral replication or pathogenesis. Our studies using purified wild-type and Ubl mutant proteases revealed that mutations in the viral Ubl domain destabilize and inactivate the adjacent viral protease. Furthermore, we show that a CoV encoding the mutant Ubl domain is unable to replicate at high temperature or cause lethal disease in mice.

Fetal Exposure to Ethanol Has Long-Term Effects on the Severity of Influenza Virus Infections								JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY				182	12			7803	7808		10.4049/jimmunol.0803881				JUN 15 2009	2009	Alcohol use by pregnant women is a significant public health issue despite well-described risks to the fetus including physical and intellectual growth retardation and malformations. Although clinical studies are limited, they suggest that in utero alcohol exposure also results in significant immune deficiencies in naive neonates. However, little is known about fetal alcohol exposure (FAE) effects on adult infections. Therefore, to determine the long-term effects of FAE on disease susceptibility and the adult immune system, we infected FAE adult mice with influenza virus. In this study, we demonstrate that mice exposed to ethanol during gestation and nursing exhibit enhanced disease severity as well as increased and sustained pulmonary viral titers following influenza virus infection. Secondary exposure to alcohol as an adult further exacerbates these effects. Moreover, we demonstrate that FAE mice have impaired adaptive immune responses, including decreased numbers of virus-specific pulmonary CD8 T cells, a decreased size and frequency of pulmonary B cell foci, and reduced production of influenza-specific Ab following influenza infection. Together, our results suggest that FAE induces significant and long-term defects in immunity and susceptibility to influenza virus infection and that FAE individuals could be at increased risk for severe and fatal respiratory infections.

Toll-Like Receptor 3 Is Critical for Coxsackievirus B4-Induced Type 1 Diabetes in Female NOD Mice								ENDOCRINOLOGY				156	2			453	461		10.1210/en.2013-2006				FEB 2015	2015	Group B coxsackieviruses (CVBs) are involved in triggering some cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). However, the molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this remain elusive. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), a receptor that recognizes viral double-stranded RNA, is hypothesized to play a role in virus-induced T1DM, although this hypothesis is yet to be substantiated. The objective of this study was to directly investigate the role of TLR3 in CVB-triggered T1DM in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a mouse model of human T1DM that is widely used to study both spontaneous autoimmune and viral-induced T1DM. As such, we infected female wild-type (TLR3(+/+)) and TLR3 knockout (TLR3(-/-)) NOD mice with CVB4 and compared the incidence of diabetes in CVB4-infected mice with that of uninfected counterparts. We also evaluated the islets of uninfected and CVB4-infected wild-type and TLR3 knockout NOD mice by immunohistochemistry and insulitis scoring. TLR3 knockout mice were markedly protected from CVB4-induced diabetes compared with CVB4-infected wild-type mice. CVB4-induced T-lymphocyte-mediated insulitis was also significantly less severe in TLR3 knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. No differences in insulitis were observed between uninfected animals, either wild-type or TLR3 knockout mice. These data demonstrate for the first time that TLR3 is 1) critical for CVB4-induced T1DM, and 2) modulates CVB4-induced insulitis in genetically prone NOD mice.

The animals were killed at 18-59 days post-infection (dpi), except for two mice that died at 6 and 32 dpi, and samples of brain, heart, pancreas, kidney, Peyer's patches, spleen, lung and thymus were processed for virological, histopathological and immimohistochemical examination. Apart from the two deaths, the experimental infection was inapparent, but virus was invariably recovered from faeces and several organs. The main histopathological lesions were focal interstitial pancreatitis, depletion of thymus and Peyer's patches, and interstitial pneumonia. Additionally, in the two mice that died, multifocal interstitial myocarditis was observed. EMCV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of pancreatic acinar cells and in macrophages of the lung and the thymus. Antigen was also detected in the cytoplasm of cardiac muscle cells from three animals, including the two that died. The results support the role of mice, in addition to rats, as reservoir hosts in the epidemiology of EMCV infections on pig farms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In alphavirus encephalomyelitis, antibody clears infectious virus from neurons in all regions of the central nervous system (CNS), but CD8 T cells contribute to elimination of viral RNA. To understand the role of T cells in clearance, we infected antibody knockout mice with Sindbis virus. Virus was cleared from spinal cord and brain stem neurons, but not from cortical neurons, and required both CD4 and CD8 T cells. Infection with cytokine-expressing recombinant viruses suggested that T cells used interferon-gamma, but not tumor necrosis factor alpha, in clearing virus and that populations of neurons differ in responsiveness to this effector pathway.

Inhibition of NF-kappa B Signaling Reduces Virus Load and Gammaherpesvirus-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PATHOLOGY				177	2			608	621		10.2353/ajpath.2010.091122				AUG 2010	2010	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic progressive lung disorder of unknown etiology. Several studies have demonstrated an association between pulmonary infection with a herpesvirus and IPF. Based on those observations, we have developed a mouse model in which interferon (IFN)gamma R-/- mice infected intranasally with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) develop lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that viral load was a critical factor for the development of fibrosis. Because nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B signaling is required to efficiently establish gammaherpesvirus, latency we infected IFN gamma R-/- mice with a MHV68 virus that expresses a mutant dominant inhibitor of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway, called I kappa B alpha M. Striking differences were observed at the onset of the chronic infection, which correlated with a decreased virus load in mice infected with MHV68-I kappa B alpha M compared with mice infected with control MHV68 (MHV68-MR). IFN gamma R-/- mice infected with MHV68-I kappa B alpha M lacked vasculitis and fibrosis 15 to 120 days post infection. Inhibition of NF-kappa B in MHV68-infected cells of the lungs diminished the expression of the fibrocyte recruiting chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and CXCL12, ameliorated macrophage expression of markers of alternative activation, and failed to increase expression of the integrin alpha v beta 6, which is implicated in the activation of the profibrotic factor TGF-beta. Thus, the inhibition of NF-kappa B signaling in the infected lung cells of IFN gamma R-/- mice reduces virus persistence and ameliorates profibrotic events. Host determinants of latency might therefore represent new therapeutic targets for gammaherpesvirus-associated pulmonary fibrosis.

In addition it describes pathological findings in the artificially infected experimental animals. The results obtained are as follows: Virus isolated from throat washings of patients with primary atypical pneumonia was neutralized not by sera obtained during the acute phase of the disease but by convalescent sera while the sera obtained during and after the 3d month from onset of the disease did not neutralize this virus. Neutralizing antibodies and cold hemag-glutinins in the sera of the patients paralleled each other. The sera from rabbits immunized with the lyophilized homogenate of the lungs of the artificially infected mice showed neutralizing activities for this virus, and also remarkable rises in the titer of cold hemagglutinins. Study on pathological anatomy of the lungs of the affected animals revealed the typical signs of diffuse interstitial pneumonia. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19563000014255

In a previous study, DV was also found in a high percentage (39.6%) of ectoparasitic hematophagous dipters specifics of these hematophagous bats. In order to verify the susceptibility of these ectoparasites to DV, in this work experimental infections with VD2 of organs explants of Strebla wiedemanni and of Melophagus ovinus were performed using C6/36 cells as control. Viral titers (UFP/mL) were determined at 0, 48 and 96 hrs pi. Infected organs were observed by electron microscopy and under the confocal microscopy indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using specific conjugates against DV. The infected organs of both species of ectoparasites replicated DV at titers similar to those obtained with the C6/36 cell line (≥106 UFP/mL). Electron microscopy and IIF showed DV replication in the digestive tract, tracheoles, reproductive organs of males but not in females, and milk glands (MG) of both species. In the fatty bodies of the MG of M. ovinus, zones with a high affinity for the DV were observed. In this work the susceptibility of S. wiedemanni and M. ovinus to DV was demonstrated and consequently the probable role of this ectoparasites as wild reservoirs of DV.

Approximately 20% of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b infection have nonresponse to the most current treatment, pegylated interferon with ribavirin. Mutations in the HCV core region were recently proposed to be associated with nonresponse. Our aim was to evaluate the viral factors associated with treatment failure.Methods. HCV variants were determined directly and after cloning in 66 HCV-1b-infected Japanese patients and in 5 urokinase-type plasminogen activator transgenic severe combined immunodeficiency mice with human hepatocytes (chimeric mice), at baseline, during treatment, and after treatment.Results. At baseline, glutamine at position 70 of the HCV core protein (70Q) was detected by direct sequencing in 20% of patients with virologic response and in 43.8% of patients with nonresponse. Among patients with nonresponse, who were examined during and after treatment, the prevalence of the 70Q substitution increased to 56.3%, which indicates that treatment-induced selection occurred in all patients with nonresponse who had 70Q quasispecies detectable by cloning. This observation was reinforced by the results from experimentally infected chimeric mice. Logistic regression analysis indicated that detection of 70Q quasispecies was associated with a statistically significantly increased risk of nonresponse (odds ratio, 15.1; P = .004) in the studied cohort.Conclusion. Presence of the 70Q quasispecies at baseline was associated with an increased risk of treatment failure, as indicated by the positive selection of the 70Q clones induced by treatment with pegylated interferon with ribavirin. These results urge further investigation of the mechanisms of this association.																					WOS:000277176200009	20420509

A growing variety of applications have employed the CPMV display technology including vaccines, antiviral therapeutics, nanoblock chemistry, and materials science. CPMV chimeras can be inexpensively produced from experimentally infected cowpea plants and are completely stable at 37 degrees C and low pH, suggesting that they could be used as edible or mucosally-delivered vaccines or therapeutics. However, the fate of CPMV particles in vivo, or following delivery via the oral route, is unknown. To address this question, we examined CPMV in vitro and in vivo. CPMV was shown to be stable under simulated gastric conditions in vitro. The pattern of localization of CPMV particles to mouse tissues following oral or intravenous dosing was then determined. For several days following oral or intravenous inoculation, CPMV was found in a wide variety of tissues throughout the body, including the spleen, kidney, liver, lung, stomach, small intestine, lymph nodes, brain, and bone marrow. CPMV particles were detected after cardiac perfusion, suggesting that the particles entered the tissues. This pattern was confirmed using methods to specifically detect the viral capsid proteins and the internal viral RNA. The stability of CPMV virions in the gastrointestinal tract followed by their systemic dissemination supports their use as orally bioavailable nanoparticles. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

J	Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Mishra, Akhilash Chandra								Immune response during acute Chandipura viral infection in experimentally infected susceptible mice								VIROLOGY JOURNAL				5						121	10.1186/1743-422X-5-121				OCT 20 2008	2008	Background: Age dependent susceptibility was observed in Chandipura virus (CHPV) infected mice through intravenous and intraperitoneal route. Adult mice were susceptible only through intracerebral route of infection. Immature neuron and some other biological variables including immature immune system are considered to be important factor for age related susceptibility in some diseases. As Chandipura virus infects both young and adult mice brain through intracerebral route the role of immune system during peripheral infection in young susceptible mice needs to be studied.Results: Through intravenous route of infection the virus produces vireamia and cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) to replicate in the central nervous system. Circulating virus is effectively cleared by virus specific IgM antibody but replication in CNS continues. The infected mice secreted significant amount of proinflammatory cytokines like TNF alpha and MCP-1 and high amount of IFN gamma, IL-1 and IL-6 at 24 h post infection. Reduction in significant amount of CD4, CD8 and CD19 positive cells at 72 h post infection ( p < 0.000) was observed in infected mice. Suppression of T cell proliferation of splenocytes to Con A ( p < 0.000), LPS and specific antigen was also observed. Presence of preformed virus specific antibody in the form of passive immunization completely protected the mice but immunization on the day or after the virus infection could not completely protect the mice.Conclusion: Proinflammatory cytokines at 24 h post infection and reduction of CD4, CD8 and CD19 positive immune cells might make the mice immune compromised during infection. These cytokines might also increase the permeability of BBB to allow the virus to enter into CNS. Virus replication in CNS is responsible for neurological symptom and mortality. Once virus gets established in CNS it is difficult to protect the mice by passive immunization.																					WOS:000260882500001	18937835	
J	Coetzee, Peter; van Vuuren, Moritz; Venter, Estelle H.; Stokstad, Maria								A review of experimental infections with bluetongue virus in the mammalian host								VIRUS RESEARCH				182				21	34		10.1016/j.virusres.2013.12.044				MAR 28 2014	2014	Experimental infection studies with bluetongue virus (ETV) in the mammalian host have a history that stretches back to the late 18th century. Studies in a wide range of ruminant and camelid species as well as mice have been instrumental in understanding BTV transmission, bluetongue (BT) pathogenicity/pathogenesis, viral virulence, the induced immune response, as well as reproductive failures associated with BTV infection. These studies have in many cases been complemented by in vitro studies with BTV in different cell types in tissue culture. Together these studies have formed the basis for the understanding of BTV-host interaction and have contributed to the design of successful control strategies, including the development of effective vaccines. This review describes some of the fundamental and contemporary infection studies that have been conducted with BTV in the mammalian host and provides an overview of the principal animal welfare issues that should be considered when designing experimental infection studies with BTV in in vivo infection models. Examples are provided from the authors' own laboratory where the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement) have been implemented in the design of experimental infection studies with BTV in mice and goats. The use of the ARRIVE guidelines for the reporting of data from animal infection studies is emphasized. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.																					WOS:000334822500004	24462840

J	Anukumar Balakrishnan; Mishra, A. C.								Immune response during acute Chandipura viral infection in experimentally infected susceptible mice.								Virology Journal				5	121			(20 October 2008)	(20 October 2008)						2008	2008	Background: Age-dependent susceptibility has been observed in Chandipura virus (CHPV)-infected mice through intravenous and intraperitoneal route. Adult mice are susceptible only through intracerebral route of infection. Immature neuron and some other biological variables including immature immune system are considered to be important factor for age-related susceptibility in some diseases. As Chandipura virus infects both young and adult mice brain through intracerebral route, the role of immune system during peripheral infection in young susceptible mice needs to be studied. Results: Through intravenous route of infection, the virus produced viraemia and cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) to replicate in the central nervous system. Circulating virus was effectively cleared by virus-specific IgM, but replication in CNS continued. The infected mice secreted significant amount of proinflammatory cytokines like TNFalpha and MCP-1, and high amount of IFNgamma, IL-1 and IL-6 at 24 h post infection. Significant reduction of CD4, CD8 and CD19 positive cells at 72 h post infection was observed in infected mice (P<0.000). Suppression of T cell proliferation of splenocytes to Con A (P<0.000), LPS and specific antigen was also observed. The presence of preformed virus-specific antibody in the form of passive immunization completely protected the mice, but immunization on the day or after the virus infection could not completely protect the mice. Conclusion: Proinflammatory cytokines at 24 h post infection and reduction of CD4, CD8 and CD19 positive immune cells might make the mice immunocompromised during infection. These cytokines might also increase the permeability of BBB to allow the virus to enter into the CNS. Virus replication in CNS is responsible for neurological symptoms and mortality. Once the virus gets established in the CNS, it is difficult to protect the mice by passive immunization.																					CABI:20083312440

Characterization of the low-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in South Korea								POULTRY SCIENCE				90	7			1449	1461		10.3382/ps.2011-01398				JUL 1 2011	2011	The low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus can serve as a progenitor of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, so it is important to monitor the LPAI virus as well as the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. The Korean LPAI H5N1 virus, A/wild duck/Kr/CSM4-12/09 (H5N1) [Wd/CSM4-12/09], was first isolated from feces of the wild duck in South Korea. Genetic analysis showed that 7 genes of Wd/CSM 4-12/09 clustered in eastern Asia and that the neuraminidase (NA) gene of this isolate was closely related to European LPAI viruses. The Korean LPAI H5N1 virus has the highest similarity with the Japanese LPAI H5N1 virus, A/mallard/Hokkai-do/24/09 (H5N1), in 6 genes [polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase acidic protein (PA), hemagglutinin (HA), NA, and nonstructural (NS) genes]. The Korean LPAI H5N1 virus did not replicate in experimentally infected chickens, whereas it replicated in ducks and mice without preadaptation. This study shows that the first Korean LPAI H5N1 reassortment, which occurred between influenza viruses from wild migratory birds in Eurasia, has contributed to the increased diversity of the viral gene pool in eastern Asia; this has the potential to change the host range and to allow the virus to evolve into forms with increased pathogenicity.

J	NSIAH, YA; RAPP, F								ROLE OF LATENCY-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPT IN HERPES-SIMPLEX VIRUS-INFECTION								INTERVIROLOGY				32	2			101	115		10.1159/000150190				MAR-APR 1991	1991	Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specified RNA transcript has been detected by in situ hybridization and by RNA blot analyses in latently infected peripheral nerve ganglia in experimentally infected mice and humans. Physical analysis of the nucleotide sequence, approximately 2,500, indicates possible splicing of the transcript into two overlapping open reading frames (ORF) and the presence of potential promoter elements. The latency-associated transcript, probably, is involved in the maintenance of latent herpes simplex virus infection; however, recent findings indicate that latent-phase transcription is involved in some in vivo reactivation.

R			Experimental Immunology, Molecular Infection Biology, Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research						Transcriptome analysis of initial cerebral responses following neurotropic virus infection reveals faulty innate immunity and delayed antigen presentation in mice susceptible to virus-induced demyelination								European Nucleotide Archive															2021-03-11	2020	Viral infections of the central nervous system cause acute or delayed neuropathology and clinical consequences ranging from asymptomatic courses to chronic, debilitating diseases. The outcome of viral encephalitis is partially determined by genetically programmed immune response patterns of the host. Experimental infection of mice with Theilers murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) causes diverse neurologic diseases, including TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD), depending on the used mouse strain. The aim of the present study was to compare initial transcriptomic changes occurring in the brain of TMEV-infected SJL (TMEV-IDD susceptible) and C57BL/6 (TMEV-IDD resistant) mice. Animals were infected intracerebrally with TMEV and sacrificed 4, 7 or 14 days post infection (dpi). Control animals of both strains were inoculated with vehicle only and sacrificed at 7 dpi. RNA was isolated from brain tissue and analyzed by whole transcriptome sequencing. Selected differences were confirmed on a protein level by immunohistochemistry. In mock-infected mice SJL and C57BL/6 mice, 200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected. Following TMEV-infection, the number of DEGs increased to 700. Infected C57BL/6 mice showed a higher expression of transcripts related to antigen presentation MHCI I, innate antiviral immune responses and cytotoxicity, compared to infected SJL animals. Many of those genes were also upregulated in SJL mice upon infection, but the response was weaker or delayed, which could be responsible for failure of viral clearance in this mouse strain. SJL mice showed prolonged elevation of MHC II and chemotactic genes, compared to C57BL/6 mice, which presumably facilitates the induction of chronic demyelinating disease. In addition, elevated expression of several genes associated with immunomodulatory or -suppressive functions was observed in SJL mice. The exploratory study confirms previous observations in the model and provides an extensive list of immunologic parameters potentially contributing to different outcomes of viral encephalitis in two mouse strains. Overall design: Whole transcriptome sequencing of brain tissue derived from SJL and C57BL/6 mice following mock- or TMEV-infection.																					DRCI:DATA2021069021386069		
J	Slight-Webb, Samantha R.; Bagavant, Harini; Crowe, Sherry R.; James, Judith A.								Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection triggers severe pulmonary inflammation in lupus-prone mice following viral clearance								JOURNAL OF AUTOIMMUNITY				57				66	76		10.1016/j.jaut.2014.12.003				FEB 2015	2015	Each year, up to one fifth of the United States population is infected with influenza virus. Although mortality rates are low, hundreds of thousands are hospitalized each year in the United States. Specific high risk groups, such as those with suppressed or dysregulated immune systems, are at greater danger for influenza complications. Respiratory infections are a common cause of hospitalizations and early mortality in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); however, whether this increased infection risk is a consequence of the underlying dysregulated immune background and/or immunosuppressing drugs is unknown. To evaluate the influenza immune response in the context of lupus, as well as assess the effect of infection on autoimmune disease in a controlled setting, we infected lupus-prone MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice with influenza virus A PR/8/34 H1N1. Interestingly, we found that Fas(lpr) mice generated more influenza A virus specific T cells with less neutrophil accumulation in the lung during acute infection. Moreover, Fas(lpr) mice produced fewer flu-specific IgG and IgM antibodies, but effectively cleared the virus. Further, increased extrinsic apoptosis during influenza infection led to a delay in autoimmune disease pathology with decreased severity of splenomegaly and kidney disease. Following primary influenza A infection, Fas(lpr) mice had severe complications during the contraction and resolution phase with widespread severe pulmonary inflammation. Our findings suggest that influenza infection may not exacerbate autoimmune pathology in mice during acute infection as a direct result of virus induced apoptosis. Additionally, autoimmunity drives an enhanced antigen-specific T cell response to clear the virus, but persisting pulmonary inflammation following viral clearance may cause complications in this lupus animal model.

J	HARMON A T; HARMON M W; GLEZEN W P								EVIDENCE OF INTERFERON PRODUCTION IN THE HAMSTER LUNG AFTER PRIMARY OR SECONDARY EXPOSURE TO PARAINFLUENZA VIRUS TYPE 3								American Review of Respiratory Disease				125	6			706	711						1982	1982	Experimental infection of the hamster respiratory tract with parainfluenza virus type 3 was used to study the pathogenesis of viral pneumonia and the host response to infection. In this study, hamsters inoculated intranasally with parainfluenza virus type 3 produced local interferon, which was detected in lung washes obtained by in situ lavage. Interferon activity was present as early as 2 days after infection, and titers correlated directly with the quantity of virus recovered in lung washes. Parainfluenza virus type 3 was sensitive to the antiviral state induced in vitro by the lung wash interferon. Infectious virus induced interferon in cultures of immune and nonimmune lung wash cells, primarily alveolar macrophages. A secondary response of immune, mixed cultures of lymphocytes and alveolar macophages, stimulated with inactivated virus, produced low concentrations of interferon, perhaps type II. Lymphocyte-alveolar macrophage cultures produced a pH and temperature-sensitive interferon in response to mitogen induction, characteristics of type II or immune interferons in the human and murine systems. Interferon may be an early defense involved in recovery from primary infection with parainfluenza virus type 3 and may contribute to resistance to reinfection.

However, some viruses such as herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2) are recognized by initiators of the complement system, e.g. mannan-binding lectin (MBL). To study the effects of MBL deficiency during viral infection we have chosen a model of generalized HSV-2 infection. We infected MBL-A and MBL-C double knock-out mice (DKO) with HSV-2 via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. DKO mice cleared HSV-2 from the liver less efficiently than the comparable wild-type animals. The impairment to effectively neutralize HSV-2 correlated with compromised liver function as measured by increased plasma levels of alanine-amino transferase. No differences in the viral burden were found in other organs such as spleen or brain. Thus, MBL-mediated protection was limited to the effects of preservation of liver homeostasis. Reconstitution with recombinant human MBL before and during the HSV-2 infection dramatically lowered the viral titres in the liver. Taken together, the data show that MBL modulates the response to HSV-2 in mice by affecting neutralization of the virus. To analyse if MBL plays a role in establishment and progression of human HSV-2 infection we analysed MBL levels in the serum samples from asymptomatic (virus-exposed people who have never displayed symptoms of HSV-2 infection) and symptomatic HSV-2 patients (people with recurrent HSV-2 infections). We found that the frequency of the MBL deficiency (<100 ng/ml) was higher in the symptomatic group and significantly different from that in the asymptomatic group (P = 0.0369). This suggests that lack of MBL-mediated complement activation increases susceptibility to viral infection.																					WOS:000224592700016	15498041

We describe the characteristics of a pair of oseltamivir-resistant and oseltamivir-susceptible pH1N1 clinical isolates that differed by a single change (H274Y) in the neuraminidase protein. Viral fitness of pH1N1 isolates was assessed in vitro by determining replication kinetics in MDCK &#945;2,6 cells and in vivo by performing experimental infections of BALB/c mice and ferrets. Despite slightly reduced propagation of the mutant isolate in vitro during the first 24 h, the wild-type (WT) and mutant resistant viruses induced similar maximum weight loss in mice and ferrets with an identical pyrexic response in ferrets (AUC of 233.9 and 233.2, P&#8202;=&#8202;0.5156). Similarly, comparable titers were obtained for the WT and the mutant strains on days 1, 3, 6 and 9 post-infection in mouse lungs and on days 1&#8211;7 in ferret nasal washes. A more important perivascular (day 6) and pleural (days 6 and 12) inflammation was noted in the lungs of mice infected with the H274Y mutant, which correlated with increased pulmonary levels of IL-6 and KC. Such increased levels of IL-6 were also observed in lymph nodes of ferrets infected with the mutant strain. Furthermore, the H274Y mutant strain was transmitted to ferrets. In conclusion, viral fitness of the H274Y pH1N1 isolate is not substantially altered and has the potential to induce severe disease and to disseminate.

Transfusion-transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in a murine model: characterization of CMV-infected donor mice								TRANSFUSION				46	6			889	895		10.1111/j.1537-2995.2006.00820.x				JUN 2006	2006	BACKGROUND: Donor and recipient mechanisms that modulate the incidence and severity of transfusion-transmitted cytomegalovirus (TT-CMV) are unclear. The kinetics of murine CMV (MCMV) infection in the peripheral blood of donor mice were investigated to determine the utility of this model for studying TT-CMV.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: BALB/cByJ mice, experimentally infected with Smith strain MCMV, were killed at serial time points up to 28 days after infection. Peritoneal exudate cells (PECs), peripheral blood white blood cells (WBCs), plasma, and marrow were tested for MCMV DNA with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), replication-competent virus with quantitative culture, and transcription of viral genes with reverse transcription (RT)-PCR targeted at the immediate-early 1 (ie1) gene.RESULTS: PECs, macrophages infected by MCMV shortly after intraperitoneal inoculation, demonstrated high mean levels of MCMV DNA (10(5)-10(7) genome equivalents [geqs]/10(5) PECs), virus production (10(1)-10(4) infectious virions/10(5) PECs), and ie1 gene transcription, demonstrating productive infection. In contrast, while MCMV loads averaged 104 to 106 geqs per 105 peripheral WBCs, all WBC samples were uniformly negative for MCMV ie1 expression by RT-PCR and for culturable virus, consistent with latent MCMV infection. Plasma and marrow showed lower viral loads than WBCs and PECs and were all negative by culture and RT-PCR analysis.CONCLUSIONS: Following experimental MCMV infection, murine peripheral blood WBCs appear to be latently infected with virus (MCMV DNA-positive; MCMV RNA-negative; MCMV culture-negative), similar to the latently infected human monocytes in peripheral blood of CMV-seropositive donors. These donor kinetics suggest that the experimental MCMV system can be used to effectively model the mechanisms of TT-CMV infections in humans.																					WOS:000237741400006	16734804

To address the causal impact of lifelong persistent viral infection on immune homeostasis and defense, we infected young mice systemically with HSV-1, murine CMV, or both viruses and studied their T cell homeostasis and function. Herpesvirus(+) mice exhibited increased all-cause mortality compared with controls. Upon Listeria-OVA infection, 23-mo-old animals that had experienced lifelong herpesvirus infections showed impaired bacterial control and CD8 T cell function, along with distinct alterations in the T cell repertoire both before and after Listeria challenge, compared with age-matched, herpesvirus-free controls. Herpesvirus infection was associated with reduced naive CD8 T cell precursors above the loss attributable to aging. Moreover, the OVA-specific CD8 T cell repertoire recruited after Listeria challenge was entirely nonoverlapping between control and herpesvirus(+) mice. To our knowledge, this study for the first time causally links lifelong herpesvirus infection to all-cause mortality in mice and to disturbances in the T cell repertoire, which themselves correspond to impaired immunity to a new infection in aging.

Here we examined herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) pathogenesis in Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; mice and in IFN&#945;&#223;&#947;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice following corneal infection and bioluminescent imaging. Two divergent and paradoxical patterns of infection were observed. Mice with an N-terminal deletion in Stat1 (129Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; (N-term)) had transient infection of the liver and spleen, but succumbed to encephalitis by day 10 post-infection. In stark contrast, infection of IFN&#945;&#223;&#947;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice was rapidly fatal, with associated viremia and fulminant infection of the liver and spleen, with infected infiltrating cells being primarily of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. To resolve the surprising difference between Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; and IFN&#945;&#223;&#947;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice, we infected an additional Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; strain deleted in the DNA-binding domain (129Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; (DBD)). These 129Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; (DBD) mice recapitulated the lethal pattern of liver and spleen infection seen following infection of IFN&#945;&#223;&#947;R&#8722;/&#8722; mice. This lethal pattern was also observed when 129Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; (N-term) mice were infected and treated with a Type I IFN-blocking antibody, and immune cells derived from 129Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; (N-term) mice were shown to be responsive to Type I IFN. These data therefore show significant differences in viral pathogenesis between two commonly-used Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; mouse strains. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that Stat1&#8722;/&#8722; (N-term) mice have residual Type I IFN receptor-dependent IFN responses. Complete loss of IFN signaling pathways allows viremia and rapid viral spread with a fatal infection of the liver. This study underscores the importance of careful comparisons between knockout mouse strains in viral pathogenesis, and may also be relevant to the causation of HSV hepatitis in humans, a rare but frequently fatal infection.

J	Davis, Gordon E.								The Rocky Mountain spotted fever rickettsia in the tick genus Ornithodoros								PROC SIXTH PACIFIC SCI CONGR				5				577	579						1942	1942	The argasid tick, O. parkeri, experimentally infected with the rickettsia of Rocky Mt. spotted fever as early-stage nymphs, can transmit the infectious agent to guinea pigs as passed on from infected [female][female] to their eggs. Guinea pigs vaccinated against spotted fever are protected against spotted fever virus after passage through O. parkeri. Such virus causes the production of both OX19 and OX2 agglutinins in rabbits. Its ability to transmit the virus and its known host relationships suggest that O. parkeri may be a factor in the maintenance of spotted fever virus in nature. O. turicata, when infected in a similar manner, has failed to transmit the infection by feeding, although the infectious agent is present in the ticks as shown by injecting them into guinea pigs. Transmission of the rickettsia from the [female] to the egg has not been demonstrated in O. turicata. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Auth. summ																					BCI:BCI19431700005654

A flow cytometry-based method for detecting antibody responses to murine cytomegalovirus infection								JOURNAL OF VIROLOGICAL METHODS				142	1-2			50	58		10.1016/j.jviromet.2007.01.006				JUN 2007	2007	An assay based on target cells infected with green fluorescent protein labeled murine cytomegalovirus (GFP-MCMV) and dual color flow cytometry for detecting antibody to MCMV is described. After optimizing conditions for this technique, kinetics of anti-MCMV IgG antibody response was tested in susceptible (BALB/c) and resistant (C57BL/6) mouse strains following primary MCMV infection. Previously published antibody kinssetics were confirmed in susceptible mice, with peak IgG response seen similar to 8 weeks after primary infection, decreasing by 20 weeks after infection. In contrast, MCMV resistant C57BL/6 mice showed significantly lower IgG antibody responses than susceptible mice. Although several techniques have been previously described to detect murine antibody responses to MCMV, including nuclear anti-complement immunofluorescence, viral immunoblotting, complement fixation, indirect immunofluorescence, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay techniques, these techniques are all time consuming and laborious. The technique presented is a simple time efficient alternative to detect previous MCMV antibody responses in experimentally infected mice. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
